**Item #:** SCP-2000

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2000 is contained at Armed Site-47, a Type 4 Restricted Zone. In accordance with Type 4 protocols, personnel assigned to SCP-2000 research, security and maintenance must undergo expanded background check procedures, as well as successfully pass a Hoiberg-Kazawa Causality Questionnaire. Access to SCP-2000 itself is limited to XN-SHEPHERD project participants with prior approval from the Director of Site-47. 

All information regarding Determinative Sets, Elevated Probability Events, Designated Magnifier Individuals and the XN-SHEPHERD program is classified and accessible only by the Director of Site-47, O5-7, and those personnel read into SCP-2000 security protocols. 

Observations of designated indicator data deviating significantly from Determinative Set XN parameters are to be reported immediately to the Director of Site-47 and treated as a Level 5 "Existential Threat" Emergency Response Event. 

**Description:** SCP-2000 is an apparatus allowing a limited degree of travel to and from periods of time in advance of those encountered in the normal course of space-time as understood by mainstream science. SCP-2000 was designed and built by the Foundation over a 25-year period using technology derived from research into SCP-████, SCP-███, and SCP-████. While the technical capabilities and design specifications of SCP-2000 are well-documented and reproduceable if necessary, the scientific and anomalous principles behind its functionality are not understood at this time. 

Upon activation, SCP-2000 is capable of transporting a living entity contained within its central chamber to a point coterminous with its present location in physical space but located in a future time period. The amount of time into the future traveled by the subject is related to the amount of energy input into SCP-2000. An approximate estimate of 3500 kWh in order to send a subject seven months into the future has been documented; however, this relationship becomes unpredictable at higher energy levels. 

Subjects using SCP-2000 will exist in the time period to which they have traveled for a duration ranging between 15 and 38 weeks before spontaneously returning to the time period of origination at a point coterminous with their present location. For safety purposes, a secure location has been established for operatives to use while waiting for return to their time of origin. Operatives must report subsequent to experiencing 98 days after SCP-2000 activation. 

While SCP-2000 enables chronological travel for living subjects, the activation process has proven severely damaging to most types of animal and plant tissue. The only exception documented to date has been tissue related to the animal nervous system. As a result, personnel designated for SCP-2000 travel must be prepared accordingly (see additional documentation for details). 

Testing has shown that under current conditions, SCP-2000 remains functional and under Foundation control through December of 2348.

**Addendum 2000-A: General Results of SCP-2000 Research**

Initial deployment of SCP-2000 began in 1995, using modified personnel to observe future conditions and events. The purpose of these deployments was to confirm the nature of travel using SCP-2000, and if possible collect data allowing the Foundation to better mitigate future anomalous phenomena. The results of these initial exploratory missions demonstrated several crucial principles for understanding observation of future events:

__Data collected using SCP-2000 is imprecise.__ Early exploratory missions yielded copious amounts of data regarding what appeared to be future events. However, subsequent observation has established that these observations are not entirely predictive. For instance, while collected data allowed Foundation assets to prevent a major security breach of SCP-███ at Site-19 in 1997, a catastrophic earthquake originating off the coast of the Western United States (observed directly by several field agents using SCP-2000) failed to occur as predicted in 1999. As more data has been collected, meta-analysis has properly contextualized observations and has assigned a probability of occurrence for major events in the future. 

__Certain individuals appear to affect causality disproportionately.__ As Foundation cataloging of possible future events increased following the completion of more exploratory missions, certain events were deemed to be undesirable for the Foundation's mission. Early attempts to influence these events met with mixed success; while manipulation and/or elimination of some individuals achieved mission goals, other Foundation attempts to influence events failed to alter outcomes at all, even when several actors deemed to be essential were liquidated. Meta-analysis has determined that in some cases, the actions (or indeed very existence) of individuals with no discernible relation to major events, sometimes in regions thousands of kilometers away, have profound and immediate impacts on these events. Since this discovery, research staff has maintained a database of these individuals.

__Few cohesive "futures" are tolerable to the continued beneficial existence of humanity.__ While observed conditions exhibit a tendency towards variation upon each exploratory mission, a number of loosely consistent "timelines" have been observed, cataloged in Foundation databases as Determinative Sets. Most Determinative Sets consist of a collective future that either renders Earth unsuitable for human civilizations (and in some cases life in total), or results in conditions directly inimical to the well-being of most of humanity. The reasons for the relative paucity of long-term survival scenarios, if any exist, are unknown at this time, as is any connection to the steadily-increasing observation of anomalous phenomena documented across the Foundation.

**Addendum 2000-B: Preparation of Personnel for Use**

Due to the nature of SCP-2000's effects on human anatomy, special preparations must be made in order to properly outfit personnel for chronological travel in a condition suitable for both survival and ability to carry out mission objectives. Because of the sensitive nature of tasks necessary during SCP-2000 missions, D-Class have been deemed unsuitable subjects.

[[/div]]

Preference for SCP-2000 subject recruitment is to be given to personnel nearing or past official retirement age. In cases where personnel have been diagnosed with terminal illness that does not impair neurological or cerebrospinal function, preference may also be granted. Personnel volunteering for SCP-2000 travel are to be moved to the Tier VI pay scale for the duration of their assignment; any survivors are entitled to an Elevated Benefits Package distributed through normal clandestine channels. 

Prior to outfitting, selected personnel are to undergo extended sensory deprivation training, concurrent with training in simulated environments analogous to those experienced by occupants of the XX890-V Life Function and Observation (LFO) system. During this period, personnel must undergo a prophylactic course of antidepressants and antipsychotics as overseen by medical staff. 

Upon completion of training regimens, personnel are to have all brain tissue, nerves, and associated nervous system structures surgically removed and transplanted into the XX890-V LFO system. All usable organs are to be harvested afterward per medical protocols. 

Current guidelines authorize the XX890-V LFO system and occupant for four uses of SCP-2000. When not engaged on missions, personnel are to be kept in an induced coma state, concurrent with research establishing 18 months as the median time period before communications and feedback from XX890-V LFO occupants become agitated and incomprehensible. 

The nature of the XX890-V LFO system is to remain classified and accessible only to senior personnel.

> ██-███,
> 
> Up to this point, all attempts at future intervention using SCP-2000 have been limited in scope and scattershot in nature. I have seen the wisdom in this approach; it is informed by painstaking contingency planning and risk/benefit evaluation. 
> 
> The last 18 months of reports, however, have promise if we are bold enough to seize the initiative. We may have found a way out, here. 
> 
> The price, though. There's always a price. As you well know. 
> 
> Consider this note an official change in policy. As of today, all efforts at intervention are now aimed at bringing about and preserving XN. Designated Magnifier Individuals associated with XN are to be protected from undue interference at the expense of all other priorities. In particular, Nuru Diagne must be allowed to die in the manner most observations have predicted for her. If anything at all changes in that regard, //make it happen//. 
> 
> I trust that you're familiar enough with the rest of the Determinative Sets to understand why we're going this way.

> One more thing: All communications, and I mean all, with anyone outside of Site-47 are to be cleared and routed through my office.

**Addendum 2000-D: Listing of Known Determinative Sets**

__Preferred Option:__

||~ Designation ||~ Description ||~ Notes ||
|| XN || Currently documented reality. Society continues along established Foundation projections regarding economic trends, environmental factors, and social upheaval. Anomalous activity continues to manifest mostly consistent with present rates. Consensus reality maintained successfully until 83345 Moore, a previously untracked asteroid 22 km in diameter, collides with Earth in January of 2349, killing most of humanity immediately and rendering the planet unsuitable for sustained human existence. || See Addendum 2000-C ||

__Other Documented Determinative Sets:__

||~ Designation ||~ Description ||~ Notes ||
|| XB || Development of society continues in manner similar to XN until April 23, 2017, when a gamma-ray burst directed at Earth and lasting 2 minutes and 38 seconds kills all known forms of life. || Researcher ███, directly observing this scenario at the time of the gamma-ray burst, was the only known living being to survive the event, and was able to continue collecting data until his return 52 days later. Study of use of XX890-V LFO system for high-radiation environments pending. ||
|| XE || The election of Sir William Entwistle as Prime Minister of New Zealand in 2049, combined with the birth of an unnamed infant boy in Ahal Province, Turkmenistan on the same day, lead to an escalating chain of events culminating in a society-destroying nuclear exchange between the nations of Israel and Greater Indonesia in 2058. All Foundation attempts to interfere with either individual merely result in the date of the nuclear exchange occurring sooner. || In all permutations of this set, widespread public knowledge of the Foundation occurs precisely 86 days before the detonation of nuclear weapons. ||
|| XH || Between the years 2023 and 2034, world governments approach global affairs at a radically increased level of cooperation due to the onset of a highly virulent influenza epidemic that kills approximately 1.4 billion worldwide. Throughout the 2040s and 2050s, many longstanding ethnic conflicts are resolved through the intervention of multilateral organizations, endemic poverty and hunger in areas such as sub-Saharan Africa and the Indian subcontinent is substantially decreased, and large-scale projects mitigating sea level rise are completed throughout coastal regions. On July 29, 2059, the entire population of Earth spontaneously vanishes along with all known animal life, with no observed return within observational range. || N/A ||
|| XO || Anomalous phenomena begins increasing in frequency by orders of magnitude beginning in 2037. The Foundation comprehensively loses capabilities to protect consensus reality by 2039 and world civilization undergoes a period of chaos and upheaval. Millions die in spontaneous riots and mass suicides become commonplace throughout the world. Numerous messianic religious movements quickly form and contribute greatly to civil conflict and internecine warfare. By the mid-2040s, several sects and remnants of national governments successfully weaponize various anomalous phenomenon, and humanity is wiped out by 2048, with the exception of a small group of survivors sheltering in the remnants of Site-104. All contact with this group is lost upon their discovery of Wing K of Site-104. || Due to the open nature of anomalous phenomena in this scenario, data collected is the most comprehensive of any Determinative Set, as Agent ██████ is able to work openly and unimpeded. ||
|| XR ||  The population of //Homo ignotus//, long estimated by Foundation operatives to be approximately 500 individuals, increases overnight to approximately 8 million individuals in 2015. A short, violent struggle ensues between the combined forces of the Foundation and //H. ignotus//, with all means of resistance to the newly ascendent //H. ignotus// population systematically destroyed within three days. Humanity is then ████████████████████████████████████████. Researchers currently have divergent theories as to whether this Determinative Set is predictive of the intentions of the known //H. ignotus// population, with current theories of "██████████████" and "████████████████████████████" being supported the most. || [DATA EXPUNGED] ||
|| XU || On February 17, 2026, contrary to all astronomical models and understanding of both classical and quantum mechanics, the Sun suddenly collapses into a black hole despite not meeting commonly understood mass thresholds for triggering such an event. Despite the almost immediate cooling of Earth and all other planets in the Solar System to approximately -270 degrees Celsius and the elimination of all other forms of life, humans are unable to die, maintaining consciousness despite the lack of continuing biological functions and almost total cessation of molecular movement. || This Determinative Set is a subset of previously designated Set XT. XT was a future in which a single totalitarian regime had assumed control over the planet and systematically exterminated Foundation personnel in particular.  Foundation researchers attempted to avert this scenario by sending three identified individuals from South Korea into orbit on the International Space Station. XU resulted. ||
