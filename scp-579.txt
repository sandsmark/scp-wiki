**Item #:** SCP-579

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-579 is currently in site 62-C (the existence of which is deemed non-essential to personnel who are not involved in containment), a compound located approximately 80 km from in Site ██, the main site . Site consists of building housing SCP-579 and living quarters for containment staff. SCP-579 is encased in a 30x 30x 30 meter unit made of [DATA EXPUNGED], in which SCP-579 is kept in permanent suspension through use of electromagnets. Site ██ is equipped with hardline to High Command through which all reports and notifications are to be made. Staff consists of two teams (each comprised of 17 Level 1 Personnel, three level 2 Personnel and one Level 4 Personnel) which are rotated bi-weekly.

All instruments are to be checked each half-hour to ensure their continued function. Changes in any measured attribute are to be immediately reported to High Command. Any instrument or electronic device registering more than 0.2% from its median range of function or displaying any errors or lapses in functioning will result in automatic execution of Action 326-Israfil. Routine reports to High Command are to be made hourly. If a report is not received within seven minutes of its scheduled time, Action 10-Israfil-A is to be executed.

Absolutely no action regarding SCP-579 other than those strictly outlined above is to be taken.

**Description:** [DATA EXPUNGED]

**Addendum [579-001]:**

Action 10-Israfil-A: Doors, windows, and other possible exits from Site ██ are to be sealed, preventing the transfer of personnel into or out of the site. Teams and resources required for Action 10-Israfil-B are to be readied and moved into position.

If reports are received by High Command at the correct time, or if instruments or electronic devices return to their normal state, High Command will issue an “All-Clear” statement. If such a statement is not received within seven minutes of the commencement of Action 10-Israfil-A, execute Action 10-Israfil-B. If at any time any instruments or electronic devices near SCP-570 begin to display significant errors or deviations from normal functioning, Action 10-Israfil-B must be executed immediately.

If an “All-Clear” statement is issued, at least 72 hours without further anomalies must pass before site can be unsealed and and Action 10-Israfil-B teams may stand down.

Action 10-Israfil-B: Gateway of site 62 ([[[SCP-004]]]) is to be destroyed. This must be done regardless of personnel or facilities remaining within the site. Remnants of the Gateway — or the gateway itself if destruction proves impossible — are to be contained in the same manner as SCP-579.  High Command will then issue further instruction.Action 10-Israfil-B: [DATA EXPUNGED]

**Addendum [579-002]:**

In the event of a successful Action 10-Israfil-B, all sealed documents regarding SCP-579 are to be released to all personnel involved with the Action. Procedures as outlined within the documents are to be followed (along with contingency plans if necessary). Be aware that even with the successful execution of Action 326-B, estimates place the occurrence of [DATA EXPUNGED] at 1 year or less.

If SCP-579 is mentioned, in any capacity, by SCP-███, any anti-foundation or public groups, or [DATA EXPUNGED]; it is recommended that Action 10-Israfil-A be executed as planned immediately.

In the event of an unsuccessful Action 10-Israfil-B, no further action will be necessary. [SUBSEQUENT DATA EXPUNGED]
