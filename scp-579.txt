**Item #:** SCP-579

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-579 is currently held in site 62-C, a compound located approximately 80 km from the main site. Site consists of building housing SCP-579 and living quarters for containment staff. SCP-579 is encased in a 60 m x 60 m x 60 m block of [DATA EXPUNGED] which is suspended in vacuum through use of electromagnets. Site 62-C is equipped with hardline to High Command through which all reports and notifications are to be made. Staff consists of two teams (each comprised of 17 Level 1 Personnel, three level 2 Personnel and one Level 4 Personnel) which are rotated bi-weekly.

All instruments and their backups are to be checked each half-hour to ensure their continued function. Changes in any measured attribute are to be immediately reported to High Command. Any deviation in any measured attribute greater than 0.02% of the accepted norm value will result in automatic execution of Action 326.  Routine reports to High Command are to be made hourly. If a report is not received within 6 minutes of its scheduled time, Action 326 is to be executed.

Absolutely no action regarding SCP-579 other than those strictly outlined above is to be taken

**Description:** [DATA EXPUNGED]

**Addendum [579-001]:**

**Action 326:** High-level operatives within the main site 62 are to be immediately evacuated. Containment of other SCPs housed within the site is to be continued, with corresponding necessary staff remaining at their posts. Teams and resources required for Action 326-B are to be readied and moved into position.

If delayed reports are received by High Command or if measured attributes return to their accepted norm value, High Command will issue an “All-Clear” statement. If such a statement is not received within five minutes of the commencement of Action 326, execute Action 326-B. If at any time any measured attribute of SCP-579 deviates more than 0.09%, execute Action 326-B. 

If an “All-Clear” statement is issued, at least 72 hours without further anomalies must pass before evacuated personnel may return to their stations and Action 326-B teams may stand down.

**Action 326-B:** Gateway of site 62 ([[[SCP-004]]]) is to be destroyed. This must be done regardless of personnel or facilities remaining within the site. Remnants of the Gateway — or the gateway itself if destruction proves impossible — are to be contained in the same manner as SCP-579.  High Command will then issue further instruction.

**Addendum [579-002]:**

In the event of an unsuccessful Action 326-B, no further action will be necessary. [SUBSEQUENT DATA EXPUNGED]

In the event of a successful Action 326-B, sealed document 891 — which contains all data regarding SCP-579, as well as all hypothetical contingency plans — is to be opened. Procedures as outlined within the document are to be followed. Be aware that even with the successful execution of Action 326-B, estimates place the occurrence of [DATA EXPUNGED] at 1 year or less.

If SCP-579 is mentioned, in any capacity, within data or observation gathered from [[[SCP-432]]] or [[[SCP-121]]] it is required that sealed document 891 be opened. In such an event it is strongly recommended that Action 326 be executed, with Action 326-B withheld.
