**Item #:** SCP-579

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-579 is currently held in Site-62c, a compound located within [[[SCP-004|SCP-004-1]]] approximately 53 km from Site-62. Site consists of structure housing SCP-579, living quarters for containment staff as well as an emergency power system and UPS separate from Site-62 main grid. SCP-579 is encased in a 20 m x 20 m x 20 m unit of Maalikite-1041[[footnote]]Specifically ^^63^^Cu,,2,,^^289^^Fl^^16^^O,,3,,(^^287^^UupH,,2,,),,2,,. Complete materials information on file under MRS.M1041[[/footnote]] maintained in solid state via SSE array. Site-62c is equipped with direct line to O5 Command through which all reports and notifications are to be made. Staff consists of two teams (each composed of 17 Level 1 Personnel, three level 2 Personnel, and one Level 4 Personnel) which are rotated bi-weekly.[[footnote]]See S.579.c for full personnel requirements.[[/footnote]] Intra-team duty shifts must overlap by no less than 1 hour.

All primary sensors and SSEs, as well as backups A-D are to be checked hourly on the hour to ensure continued function; backups E-J shall be likewise checked hourly on the half-hour. Replacement of devices and SSE maintenance are to be performed as outlined in schedules S.579.a and S.579.b.

Changes in any measured attribute must be immediately reported to O5 Command. Any instrument or device registering more than 0.2% deviation from its corresponding acceptable range of function—or otherwise displaying any errors or lapse in function—will result in site-automated initiation of Action Hadron-L-1. Routine "situation normal" reports to O5 Command are to be made hourly. If such a report is not received within (3) minutes of its scheduled time, O5 shall initiate Action Hadron-L-1.

Absolutely no action regarding SCP-579 other than those strictly outlined above is to be taken.

**Description:** [DATA EXPUNGED]

**Document 579-01:**

//Action Hadron-L-1:// Gateway to Site-62 ([[[SCP-004]]]) and Site 62 shall be immediately placed on lock down with all transference of personnel or items to/from [[[SCP-004|SCP-004-1]]] suspended. Task Force ΡΙΔ-1 shall enter "Ready" status in preparation for Action Hadron-L-2.

If delayed "situation normal" reports are subsequently received by O5 Command, or if all deviations/malfunctions cease, O5 Command will issue a “Stand Down” order. If such a statement is not received within (7) minutes of the commencement of Action Hadron-L-1, execute Action Hadron-L-2. If at any time instrumental deviation exceeds 0.9%, execute Action Hadron-L-2.

If a “Stand Down” order is issued by O5 Command, Task Force ΡΙΔ-1 shall suspend execution of Action Hadron-L-2. After no less than 72 hours without further incident, O5 shall issue an "All Clear" notice. Once such notice has been received Task Force ΡΙΔ-1 shall exit "Ready" status and all normal base operations may resume.  

//Action Hadron-L-2:// Gateway to Site-62 ([[[SCP-004]]]) is to be closed and subsequently destroyed. This must be done regardless of personnel or facilities remaining within the site. Remnants of the gateway are to be contained in the same manner as SCP-579.  O5 Command will then issue further instruction.

**Document 579-02:**

In the event of a successful Action Hadron-L-2, Sealed Reports H-M are to be released to all personnel with RA-ΖΛ Clearance.  Procedures as outlined within the documents are to be followed (along with contingency plans if necessary). Be aware that even with a successful execution of Action Hadron-L-2, 84% of projections place the occurrence of [DATA EXPUNGED] at 14 months or less. Upper bound of projections place occurrence at 26 months or less.

If SCP-579 is mentioned in any capacity by any anti-Foundation or public groups it is recommended that Action Hadron-L-1 be implemented in standby, with Action Hadron-L-2 withheld.

In the event of an unsuccessful Action Hadron-L-2, no further action will be necessary. [SUBSEQUENT DATA EXPUNGED]

Termination of agents to prevent data leakage regarding SCP-579 [DATA EXPUNGED] is deemed unnecessary, as only 7 such agents remain. Agent ███-█ is permanently stationed with Task Force ΡΙΔ-1. Agent ███-█ is removed from active duty and retained in an advisory capacity to O5 Command. Former Agents ███-█, ███-█, ███-█, ███-█, and ███-█ are given Class-B (reversible) amnesiacs and reassigned within the Foundation.  Listed Agents are restricted from duties involving Keter or Euclid class artifacts or duties which would station them at sites where such artifacts are contained.
