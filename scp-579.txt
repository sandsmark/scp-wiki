**Item #:** SCP-579

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-579 is currently in Site-62c (the existence of which is deemed non-essential to personnel not involved in containment), a compound located in [[[SCP-004|SCP-004-1]]] approximately 53 km from Site-62. Site consists of structure housing SCP-579, living quarters for containment staff as well as an emergency power system and UPS separate from Site-62 main grid. SCP-579 is encased in a 30 m x 30 m x 30 m unit of █████████████████ which is kept in permanent suspension through use of electromagnets. Site-62c is equipped with hardline to O5 Command through which all reports and notifications are to be made. Staff consists of two teams (each composed of 17 Level 1 Personnel, three level 2 Personnel, and one Level 4 Personnel) which are rotated bi-weekly. Consecutive intra-team duty shifts must overlap by no less than 1 hour. 

All primary sensors and █████████, as well as backups A-D are to be checked each hour on the hour to ensure their continued function. Backups E-J are likewise to be checked each hour on the half-hour. Replacement of devices and █████████ maintenance are to be performed as outlined in schedules S.579-b and S.579-c, respectively. 

Changes in any measured attribute are to be immediately reported to O5 Command. Any instrument or device registering more than 0.2% deviation from its corresponding acceptable range of function—or otherwise displaying any errors or lapses in function—will result in site-automated execution of Action 316-Israfil-A. Routine "situation normal" reports to O5 Command are to be made hourly. If such a report is not received within (7) minutes of its scheduled time, Action 316-Israfil-A is to be executed.

Absolutely no action regarding SCP-579 other than those strictly outlined above is to be taken.

**Description:** [DATA EXPUNGED]

**Addendum 579-01:**

Action 316-Israfil-A: [[[SCP-004|Gateway to Site 62]]] is to be immediately closed, and all transference of personnel or items to/from [[[SCP-004|SCP-004-1]]] suspended. Task Forces █████ and ████ shall enter "Ready" status in preparation for Action 316-Israfil-B.

If delayed "situation normal" reports are subsequently received by O5 Command, or if all deviating/malfunctioning devices resume functioning within acceptable range, O5 Command will issue a “Stand Down” order. If such a statement is not received within (11) minutes of the commencement of Action 316-Israfil-A, execute Action 316-Israfil-B. If at any time instrumental deviation exceeds 0.9%, execute Action 316-Israfil-B.

If a “Stand Down” order is issued by O5 Command, Task Forces █████ and ████ shall suspend execution of Action 316-Israfil-B. However, █████ and ████ will remain in "Ready" status and the gateway to Site-62 shall remain closed pending further orders from O5 Command. After no less than 72 hours without further incident, O5 shall issue an "All Clear" notice. Once such notice has been received Task Forces █████ and ████ shall stand down, the gateway to Site 62 may be reopened, and all normal base operations may resume.  

Action 316-Israfil-B: [[[SCP-004|Gateway to Site 62]]] is to be destroyed. This must be done regardless of personnel or facilities remaining within the site. Remnants of the gateway—or the gateway itself if destruction proves impossible—are to be contained in the same manner as SCP-579.  Agent ███-█ will oversee and report to O5 Command. O5 Command will then issue further instruction.

**Addendum 579-02:**

In the event of a successful Action 316-Israfil-B, documents [DATA EXPUNGED] though [DATA EXPUNGED] are to be released to ██████████, ████████, ██████████, █████████ and ████████.  Procedures as outlined within the documents are to be followed (along with contingency plans if necessary). Be aware that even with a successful execution of Action 316-Israfil-B, 74% of projections place the occurrence of [DATA EXPUNGED] at 14 months or less. Upper bound of projections place the occurrence at 26 months or less.

If SCP-579 is mentioned in any capacity by SCP-███, any anti-Foundation or public groups, or [DATA EXPUNGED] it is recommended that Action 316-Israfil-A be implemented in standby, with Action 316-Israfil-B withheld. O5 Command will advise further.

In the event of an unsuccessful Action 316-Israfil-B, no further action will be necessary. [SUBSEQUENT DATA EXPUNGED]

Agent ███-█ is removed from prior duty and permanently stationed with Task Forces █████ and ████ at [DATA EXPUNGED]. Agent ███-█ is removed from all active duty and prohibited from further contact with any SCP artifact, currently serving in an advisory capacity to O5 Command. Former Agents ███-█, ███-█, ███-█, ███-█, and ███-█ are given Class-B (reversible) amnesiacs and reassigned within the Foundation; all records of their involvement with or knowledge of SCP-579 are expunged and their personal identities changed; Agent designations changed to [DATA EXPUNGED], [DATA EXPUNGED], [DATA EXPUNGED], [DATA EXPUNGED], and [DATA EXPUNGED]. Listed Agents are restricted from duties involving Keter or Euclid class artifacts or duties which would station them at sites where such artifacts are contained. [SUBSEQUENT DATA EXPUNGED]
