**Item #:** SCP-579

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-579 is currently held in Site ██, the existence of which is deemed non-essential to personnel who are not involved in containment. Site consists of building housing SCP-579 and living quarters for containment staff. SCP-579 is encased in a 30x 30x 30 meter unit made of [DATA EXPUNGED], in which SCP-579 is kept in permanent suspension through use of electromagnets. Site ██ is equipped with hardline to High Command through which all reports and notifications are to be made. Staff consists of two teams (each comprised of 17 Level 1 Personnel, three level 2 Personnel and one Level 4 Personnel) which are rotated bi-weekly.

All instruments and their backups are to be checked each half-hour to ensure their continued function. Changes in any measured attribute are to be immediately reported to High Command. Any deviation in any measured attribute greater than 0.02% of the accepted norm value will result in automatic execution of Action 326-Israfil. Routine reports to High Command are to be made hourly. If a report is not received within 6 minutes of its scheduled time, Action 10-Israfil-A is to be executed.
Absolutely no action regarding SCP-579 other than those strictly outlined above is to be taken.

**Description:** [DATA EXPUNGED]

**Addendum [579-001]:**

Action 10-Israfil-A: Doors, windows, and other possible exits from Site ██ are to be sealed, preventing the transfer of personnel into or out of the site. Teams and resources required for Action 10-Israfil-B are to be readied and moved into position.

If delayed reports are received by High Command or if insturments return to their accepted norm value, High Command will issue an “All-Clear” statement. If such a statement is not received within seven minutes of the commencement of Action 10-Israfil-A, execute Action 10-Israfil-B. If at any time any instruments surrounding SCP-579 deviate above 0.09 of standard readings, execute Action 10-Israfil-B.

If an “All-Clear” statement is issued, at least 72 hours without further anomalies must pass before site can be unsealed and and Action 10-Israfil-B teams may stand down.

Action 10-Israfil-B: [DATA EXPUNGED]

**Addendum [579-002]:**
In the event of a successful Action 10-Israfil-B, all sealed documents regarding SCP-579 are to be released to all personnel involved with the Action. Procedures as outlined within the documents are to be followed (along with contingency plans if necesary).

If SCP-579 is mentioned, in any capacity, by SCP-███, any anti-foundation or public groups, or [DATA EXPUNGED]; it is reccomended that Action 10-Israfil-A be executed as planned immediately.
In the event of an unsuccessful Action 10-Israfil-B, no further action will be necessary. [SUBSEQUENT DATA EXPUNGED]
