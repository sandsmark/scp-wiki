Sorry that this is somewhat spartan in both style and content.  Come back in about a year and there'll be different colours, and fonts, maybe a picture or too.  I don't know. I'm just blue sky thinking here. 

To be honest, I would've preferred a few more decent scips under my belt before creating this page, but I'm doing it more to have "everything under one roof", so to speak.


**Tales and SCiPs and That:**
[http://www.scp-wiki.net/golan Golan] - a tale about entirely necessary and completely uncruel testing of a D-class -  moll//usc// me no questions, I'll tell you no lies.  This is tied to SCP-2982 below.

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/SCP-2982 SCP-2982] - aka //Televon Telefex Secrecy-8//, a scip about a mobile phone that can change a contact's real life details.

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2983 SCP-2983] - aka //Capel Celyn//, a short works entry about a Welsh village drowned IRL to make a reservoir and the people who returned to live there.

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2962 SCP-2962] - aka //Supacansa//, a scip about a house which has been diagnosed with cancer.


**Random upcoming scips:**

From the [http://www.scp-wiki.net/log-of-extranormal-events Log of Extranormal Events]:

**Event Description:** Over an eight minute period, six hundred and ninety seven lightning strikes occurred within a twenty mile wide radius around Faeto, Italy. Meteorological data shows that the locations of these strikes formed a "smiley." At the same time, all drinking water within the settlement was, according to anecdotal evidence, icy cold, scented of strawberries, and could not be boiled or otherwise heated.
**Date of occurrence:** 2015/07/01
**Location:** Faeto, Italy
**Follow-up actions taken:** Water supplies and meteorological data throughout Puglia to be monitored over a six month period.


**Event Description:** Commencing at 07:31, all instances of the Basenji breed of Canis lupus familiaris barked constantly for one minute and forty three seconds. Commencement/cessation of barking was not linked to any external stimuli.
**Date of occurrence:** 2015/07/03
**Location:** Australia

I've written a couple of very short pieces on www.Fanfiction.net in the Hellraiser universe -

[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11063653/1/There-Are-No-Limits There Are No Limits] about a misguided criminal beginning to regret summoning demons from hell in his bathroom.


[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11096568/1/Laslo-Undone Laslo Undone] about a leper with a vested interest in summoning Bad Things...
