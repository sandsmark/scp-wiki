Hi %%title%%,
[[/module]]
Sorry that this is somewhat spartan in both style and content.  Come back in about a year and there'll be different colours, and fonts, maybe a picture or too.  I don't know. I'm just blue sky thinking here. 

To be honest, I would've preferred a few more decent scips under my belt before creating this page, but I'm doing it more to have "everything under one roof", so to speak.


**Tales and SCiPs and That:**
[http://www.scp-wiki.net/golan Golan] - a tale about entirely necessary and completely uncruel testing of a D-class -  moll//usc// me no questions, I'll tell you no lies.  This is tied to SCP-2982 below. In exact opposition to the scips I write, which take months of work and revision (for fairly modest results so far), this tale wrote itself in about two hours. A bit of critique from Zyn, and it was good to go.

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/SCP-2982 SCP-2982] - aka //Televono Telefex Secrecy-8//, a scip about a mobile phone that can change a contact's real life details. Wow did this one take a lot of work before it was ready.... And a lot of work afterwards, too.  Main problem here was the scip is an unfolding story, but articles aren't. So tell it as a story in the scip, and you alienate people; tell it straight as a "this is X, it does Y to Z" article and you lose the reveal.  A tale? Same problem, and I think it would suffer from TL;DR syndrome.

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2983 SCP-2983] - aka //Capel Celyn//, a short works entry about a Welsh village drowned IRL to make a reservoir and the people who returned to live there. I'm going to revise this in the near future, as it lacks the personal touch that the backstory deserves. Also, it's too short and doesn't really get to grips with either the feel of the rural community or the IRL controversy that happens when an English council push through a law to drown a Welsh village.

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2962 SCP-2962] - aka //Supacansa//, a scip about a house which has been diagnosed with cancer. This started out in April as a cigarette factory, the tobacco of which had somehow seeped into the building itself over the years.  That was too " big" so I scaled it down to a terraced house in Bedford.


From the [http://www.scp-wiki.net/log-of-extranormal-events Log of Extranormal Events]:

**Event Description:** Over an eight minute period, six hundred and ninety seven lightning strikes occurred within a twenty mile wide radius around Faeto, Italy. Meteorological data shows that the locations of these strikes formed a "smiley." At the same time, all drinking water within the settlement was, according to anecdotal evidence, icy cold, scented of strawberries, and could not be boiled or otherwise heated.
**Date of occurrence:** 2015/07/01
**Location:** Faeto, Italy
**Follow-up actions taken:** Water supplies and meteorological data throughout Puglia to be monitored over a six month period.


**Event Description:** Commencing at 07:31, all instances of the Basenji breed of Canis lupus familiaris barked constantly for one minute and forty three seconds. Commencement/cessation of barking was not linked to any external stimuli.
**Date of occurrence:** 2015/07/03
**Location:** Australia
**Follow-up actions taken:** Fallopia, Agent [REDACTED]'s Basenji, taken for post-anomaly testing. No anomalous activity noted since.

I've written a couple of very short pieces on www.Fanfiction.net in the Hellraiser universe -

[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11063653/1/There-Are-No-Limits There Are No Limits] about a misguided criminal beginning to regret summoning demons from hell in his bathroom.


[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11096568/1/Laslo-Undone Laslo Undone] about a leper with a vested interest in summoning Bad Things...
