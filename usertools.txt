title:SCP Wiki Usertools
+ What this is

This page hosts extensions, tools and scripts to alter and hopefully improve your site experience. If it's hosted here it should work on all browsers that the tool has been tested on. If they don't, or if you need the script to support your browser and it doesn't, report any bugs to the [http://05command.wikidot.com/technical-staff-main Tech Staff] and they'll work on a fix.

+ What this isn't

An attempt to screw with your browser, your computer, or your life. Nor is it a vast conspiracy to steal those pics of you at the beach wearing nothing but a small guinea pig and assorted fruits. Seriously, these don't do anything other than modify your user experience on the SCP wiki.

+ Extensions

An extension is a fully-fledged addition to your browser that is installed from your browser's extension and/or app store. Extensions will automatically update.

+ Tampermonkey userscripts

A userscript is a single Javascript file that runs on your page. It is essentially a much smaller extension. Userscripts must be installed manually through a script manager such as Tampermonkey. These userscripts do not automatically update.

[[collapsible show="+ How to install a userscript"]]

> ++ How to enable your browser to run userscripts
> 
> Browsers don't know how to run userscripts by default - to teach them how, you'll need to install an extension that manages them. We recommend Tampermonkey, which works for most browsers. Other userscript managers are available, but it is not guaranteed that these userscripts will work for those.
> 
> **[[image FF_icon.png]] Firefox:**
> 
> # Go [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/ here].
> # Click the button labeled '+ Add to Firefox' to install Tampermonkey.
> 
> **[[image Chrome_icon.png]] Chrome:**
> 
> # Go [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo here].

> **[[image Opera_icon.png]] Opera:**
> 
> # Go [https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/tampermonkey-beta/ here].
> # Click the button labeled 'Add to Opera' to install Tampermonkey.

> 
> # Go [https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/p/tampermonkey/9nblggh5162s?rtc=1&activetab=pivot:overviewtab here].
> # Click the button labeled 'Get' to install Tampermonkey.
> 
> This will install the base you need to be able to run the scripts linked here.

> ++ How to install the userscripts
> 
> **Any browser using Tampermonkey:**
> 
> # Pick the userscript you want and click the link labelled "Click here to download/install".
> # You should be redirected to Tampermonkey. Click "Install".
>  * If you are not redirected, and the file simply downloads itself, then Tampermonkey is not correctly installed.
>  * If the userscript fails to install for whatever reason, let a Tech Team member know.
> # Refresh the page, and your userscript should be active.
> # Continue browsing!
> # If at any point you get redirected to a page that says "//A userscript wants to access a cross-origin resource.//", click "Always allow" in the bottom left. You'll have 20 seconds in which to do this - if you run out of time, don't worry, it'll pretend you said "no" and ask you again when it needs to.

++ Staff Identification 2

**Description:** Adds a title below the username to signify if a user is staff and what position they hold. May help you keep track of the shitload of staff we have to employ around here. ;)

This script works on both the SCP Wiki and on O5 Command.

++ The Jumpbox

**Link:** [[file scpwiki-jumpbox.user.js|Click here to download/install]]

**Screenshot:**

[[image Jumpbox-screenshot.png]]

**Description:** Inserts a small textbox and button next to your account information at the top right of the screen. Jumpbox allows you to instantly jump to any article you want. Typing in only numbers will shoot you off to the relevant scip. Typing in a mix of letters and numbers, or only letters, will get you that page. So 'chat guide' will get the chat guide. Note that Wikidot takes care of the spaces in there, converting them to dashes.

Both an ENTER keypress and a click on the button work to submit.

**Note:** it doesn't check whether or not the page exists and it doesn't provide anything in the way of spelling correction. 

[[collapsible show="[+] Detailed instructions for usage" hide="[-] Detailed instructions for usage"]]

Preface a title with **[modifier]|** to get a specific type of article. When you want the tale '827' by A Fat Ghost and not SCP-827, typing **t|827** will get you exactly what you want, whereas just the number, or **SCP-827** will get you the scp. 

* **j:** for Joke articles (includes a special fix for SCP-J)
* **x:** for -EX articles
* **a:** for -ARC articles
* **d:** for -D articles
* **h:** for hub pages (i.e. typing in **h|unfounded** should get you the Unfounded Canon hub page.
* **t:** for tales

If you use any other modifier, it ignores it and acts like you only requested the page you specified after the pipe. I.e. typing **o|chat guide** will get you the chat guide, ignoring the unknown modifier.

**Screenshot:**

[[image AuthorKarma-screenshot.png]]

**Description:** Replaces the Wikidot karmabar with one that signifies how many succesful scp,  tale and goi-format pages a user has written for the wiki. Also adds a textual representation after the username. This may help you determine the amount of experience a user has when it comes to writing for the wiki. However, that does **not** necessarily mean users with low author karma are inexperienced.

**Note:** The page this checks in the background may not have been updated recently (see the textual representation for the last time it was updated.)

The last time the database was updated was 22nd June 2017.
