**Name:** Dr. ██████ "Blast" ████

**Security Clearance:** Level 3 (Level 4 clearance under review)

**Occupation:** Euclid-class, Safe-class, and non-sentient object researcher. 

**Site of Operations:** Site 17 (Reassignment under review)

**SCP Files Authored:** [[[SCP-468]]], [[[SCP-462]]], [[[SCP-483]]], [[[SCP-316]]]

**Log Files:** [[[Experiment Log 316]]]

------

**Profile:** Dr. Blast is an SCP Researcher currently working at Site 17.  He appears to be a normal Caucasian, 5'10", brown hair, age indeterminate due to [[[SCP-483]]].  He was allegedly given a doctorate in Computer Science, and displays skill and interest in experimenting with non-sentient SCPs. He is amiable with most personnel, unless they make mistakes.  Co-workers describe him as "more intolerant than arrogant".  Dr. Blast is reportedly easily frightened, which may or may not be why he has advocated the destruction of over ██ SCPs to date.  He exhibits an observable aversion to sentient SCPs, any sort of danger, and [[[SCP-447]]].

**History:** No records or memories of Dr. Blast's existence or work at the Foundation prior to ██-██-20██ exist, due to an accident with [[[SCP-483]]].  Dr. Blast insists that he has worked with the Foundation for ██ years, and was instrumental in the creation of [DATA EXPUNGED], though only scattered and inconclusive proof of these claims exists.  After demonstrating his skills and knowledge about a variety of SCPs to O5-█, Dr. Blast's position was partially "reinstated", with return to his alleged position pending review.

------

__**Addendum:**__ Dr. Blast has exhibited a lethal grudge against a certain [[[the-janitor-who-cleans-up-after-messy-scps |low-level janitorial employee]]], having made at least █ recorded attempts against his life to date.  When questioned, he alleges that the man "can't clean worth a damn", and refuses to explain further.  Observation seems to indicate that Dr. Blast's grudge is connected with the origins of his nickname, and possibly [[[SCP-447]]].

**Note:** //No one knows who the fuck this guy is, and we just let him in and working on top secret projects, cause he says some thing erased his existence? Right. I call Children of the Broken God plant. Just give me one hour with him and a pair of spoons, and I'll make sure he talks.// -Dr. Bright
