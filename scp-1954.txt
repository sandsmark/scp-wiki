**Item #:** SCP-1954

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** 

While not undergoing testing SCP-1954 is to be kept in a locked filing cabinet in the office of Doctor ██████ in Site-19.  

Contact with SCP-1954 must only be performed by male operatives.  Any contact with SCP-1954 and a female staff member must be carefully recorded.  Failure to record and report any and all activity between SCP-1954 and female staff is grounds for immediate termination.  

**Description:** 

SCP-1954 is a 333 page hardcover book bearing the title __Helen Homemaker's Hints For The Harried Housewife__ stamped on front with flaking gold ink.  No marks appear elsewhere on cover, including spine.  Dust jacket, if ever present, is  missing. Copyright page indicates book copyrighted in 1954 by [DATA EXPUNGED].  Summary research into [DATA EXPUNGED] archives indicates no such publication on record.  

When in inactive state, SCP-1954 appears to be an compendium of household management ideas, recipes, decorating ideas, arts and crafts instructions and party planning help, and other general homemaking tips.  Stylized illustrations of food, cleaning supplies, and housewives decorate some pages, and some pages feature color or black and white photos of completed recipes, party scenes, or decorating ideas.  Of particular interest is the foreword by “author” Helen Homemaker on page 1:

> Welcome Harried Housewife!
> By purchasing this volume, you've made an incredible discovery!
> This volume contains all the information you need to turn your household into something worth bragging about!
> But before we begin, a simple rule.
> Homemaking is a science.  And as such, nothing you see in this book will work...
> **UNLESS YOU FOLLOW EVERY INSTRUCTION EXACTLY AS WRITTEN**
> You have been warned.
   

When book is read by a female, SCP-1954 enters active state and begins to show anomolistic traits.  All female readers who have read the book in observation have shown marked interest in homemaking, even those who have previously had no interest in the subject.  The longer the book is read, the more the interest grows.  In every test, female subjects reading the book have felt compelled to try out one of the instructions in the book themselves.  

The first attempt at following the instructions, provided the instructions are followed exactly, no matter how counter-intuitive they may sound (ex. addition of allspice to meatball recipe; presence of clown at child's birthday party), always results in a successful product (ex. incredibly flavorful meatballs; memorable and terror-free birthday party).  ANY attempt to stray from instructions (ex. cutting down on salt in pork chop recipe; using nylon blend yarn versus wool yarn on scarf knitting pattern) will result in absolute failure (ex. burnt, inedible pork chops; scarf that unravels shortly after completion).

It is noted that any male observers reading instructions presented in book will NOT notice anything counter-intuitive or strange about instructions, and any male attempting such instructions will only be as successful as they would attempting such venture using any other source instructions.

Upon subsequent uses of book, instructions are reported to become stranger and more disturbing (ex. Hints for cleaning silver includes rubbing objects with blood; instructions for throwing cocktail party involves putting arsenic in canapes). Even with such bizarre alterations, results are always successful (ex. sparkling silverware that resists tarnish; annoying loudmouth party guests leave quickly and early). Female subject using book will also grow more and more secretive about such anomolies and it was only through [DATA EXPUNGED] that researchers were able to ascertain such changes.  Subjects will refuse to cook recipes in front of observers, or discuss party plans beforehand, even after [DATA EXPUNGED].

Eventually instructions from book turn into instructions for disturbing rituals, some of which have been found to have first been recorded in [DATA EXPUNGED], some have never been previously documented.  Most of these rituals involve murder, cannibalization, sexual rituals, self mutilation, and canned vegetables.  The instructions are no longer for things as simple as the perfect meatloaf or an ice cream social, but rather ways to ensure spouse's promotion, death of rival housewife, child's placement in little league, acceptance into country club, and other similar events.  

Subjects report feeling compelled to perform such tasks, even if they have no past history of violent behavior.  Once task is performed, subject has no memory of performing such task, and when asked how they achieved such goals, they typically are evasive and will attribute their success in homemaking to “secret family recipe” or similar.  

Through use of [DATA EXPUNGED] subjects have been persuaded to transcribe instructions exactly as they see them in book.  No two instructions have ever been duplicated exactly.
