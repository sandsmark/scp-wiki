**Item #:** SCP-2000

**Object Class:** Zeno (Medium/Low)

**Special Containment Procedures:** Contained SCP-2000 instances are to be contained in individual Faraday-insulated electronics/vehicle lockers (depending on appropriate size) in Site-65 and restrained with straps attached to the top, bottom, and rear wall of the locker to prevent motion. Earth's orbit is to be monitored for possible additional instances of SCP-2000; following recovery, data regarding the probe is to be concealed via AESIR protocol, and researchers are to disable and/or remove any transmission equipment present in the instance during initial experimentation if possible.

**Description:** SCP-2000 is a series of probes of extraterrestrial origin, designated SCP-2000-A to SCP-2000-E. These devices differ radically in external design, but their internal systems, transmission parameters, and other features indicate a common origin.

SCP-2000 instances record audiovisual and other data and transmit it via radio to what is believed to the their point of departure, which researchers hypothesize to be on or orbiting a planet or other body in the Teegarden's Star system, located approximately 12.5 light-years from the Earth's sun. (See Document 2000-B, Astronomical Data.)

**SCP-2000-A** is a teardrop-shaped probe measuring 1.4 meters in diameter and coated in an 8 cm-thick layer of a pale-green polymer. A sample removed during analysis was demonstrated to be highly resistant to temperature changes, kinetic impact, chemical corrosion, and other forms of damage.

The outer coating is capable of being retracted in numerous places along the body, allowing for the use of a large central camera-like lens. The narrow section opens to allow material to be absorbed into the aperture, where it is analyzed and apparently disintegrated.

Although SCP-2000-A's internal technology was not understood to any degree during initial containment, advancements in computer science allowed Foundation researchers to begin the process of reverse-engineering SCP-2000-A's storage drives in 1986. The majority of recorded information is printed materials, with a roughly equal ratio of fiction and nonfiction sources, notably a large collection of works of H.G. Wells and Jules Verne.

> Description. SCP-2000-B is disguised as a zeppelin. It measures about  --6 feet-- 1.8 meters in length at its longest point. Its outer facade is made of copper, a fabric that looks like canvas but seems to be some sort of exotic nylon, and asbestos. Now looking inside, however, we find large torn scraps of the invulnerable plastic similar to the coating of SCP-2000, which is now called SCP-2000-A to match this new arrival. It seems to have shed its "skin" at some point. The "balloon" section of the craft is filled with machinery; the guts of the thing are similar to 2000-A's, and equally beyond human advancement.

> Mechanical appendages extend downward from the machine, including mechanical hands wearing gloves made of white plastic, a secondary microphone and what looks like other recording equipment, scissors, a comb, and a mop. When deploying the mop, it holds the mop's handle with an extended grasping tool in a manner that somewhat emulates human use. When it is indoors and a human enters visual proximity, 2000-B deploys its mop and carries out cleaning behavior until the human exits the room or faces away from the machine.

**SCP-2000-C** is a humanoid automaton measuring approximately 2.2 meters in height. The object is encased in a self-pressurizing space suit, made of a thick, highly reflective foil believed to be a derivative of the material coating SCP-2000-A, except colored bright red with a vertical white stripe on each side of the suit's limbs. The torso and shins are plated with what superficially resembles chrome but has a similar composition to the SCP-2000-A substance, and the chest opens outward to reveal that most of the torso and backpack are a single large compartment as present in previous versions of SCP-2000. The transparent face-covering visor has not been analyzed due to concerns of shattering it.

SCP-2000-C's head is made with the same chrome substance, and superficially resembles a human's, with a highly-detailed, angular mouth and jaw and eye-shaped ovals. The object will reply to prompts in English, French, and Russian with relevant prerecorded messages in a computerized voice using the language in which the prompt was made.

>  
> **Interviewer:** Where did you come from?
> 
> **SCP-2000-C:** There is a traveler from beyond the stars: gleaming, hopeful. He understands your experiences with such spacemen have caused much suffering; he pleads welcome, disarmed, and approaches the local library.
> 
> **Interviewer:** What is your purpose here?
>  
> **SCP-2000-C:** Mouth dry with the fullness of creation, he, a simulation of a billion hearts before him, tastes truth, justice, and the American way as he longs with tight anticipation for the bookstore or magazine stand closest to your house.
>  
> **Interviewer:** Why do you care about books?
>
> **SCP-2000-C:** He stood on the cusp of an immense evolution, wheeling before the thoughts of a generation like sandpaper on fire, but he needed to know the future, and the prognosis which leapt, tigerishly, like the lions of Daniel before him was: forward.
>  
> **Interviewer:** Who created you?
> 
> **SCP-2000-C:** Hurtling, Earthward, through the cold, from a distant, though not dissimilar, world, seeking the light of truth, with peace, the peace of wisdom, in their hearts, as they were, one of great minds, to read the predictions, prescient and euphonious, made, by his own hand, of man, yet beautiful, void of space came the traveler.
> 
>  **Interviewer:** Predictions?
> 
> **SCP-2000-C:** He saw that they had legends written of that which had not yet come to pass; and while those who had come before him and used them as a stopgap measure, a compensation, like a smooth gin martini, to account for the delays of transit, to let him blend in with the cities of mankind, years away, but there was priceless there, the brilliance of your soothsayers, this talent and so quickly in the fall of time.
> 
> **Interviewer:** Who are these soothsayers?
> 
> **SCP-2000-C:** //[repeats the previous statement]//
> 
> **Interviewer:** Alright. What do you mean, "delays of transit"?

**SCP-2000-D** is an autonomous extraterrestrial aircraft of similar composition and technological infrastructure to the three probes previously designated SCP-2000. The craft is an oblate spheroid with a structure that consists of eight sealed cylindrical chambers measuring 2.4 meters in length. These pods are arranged at a downward slant in a circular pattern around a central core. Each chamber has a door along the top which opens when effort is exerted in any direction upon its luminescent yellow handle. The central core contains the operational systems of the machine. Recording equipment extends from the bottom of the core, as well as grasping tools, scanners that indicate temperature and other environmental variables, a Geiger counter, an array of radiation-cleaning devices, and a tube which dispenses nutrient cubes.

In this article, "nutrient cubes" is the term used for the homogeneous, sterile cubes which are continuously internally generated by SCP-2000-D. These 25-gram green-tinted blocks contain a mixture of synthetic proteins, fats, and carbohydrates that is suitable for long-term human consumption. A test subject reported that nutrient cubes "taste like mint and salad dressing".

When SCP-2000-D encounters a human, it lowers itself to the human's eye level, begins to emit a low hum, and tilts so that one chamber is vertically upright and facing the human. The handle of the facing chamber then begins to glow with an intermittent pulsing pattern.  If the human does not grasp the door handle, SCP-2000-D will follow the human in this position for an average of 15 minutes before abandoning the procedure. The machine will also dispense nutrient cubes and offer them to the human at various stages in this process.

If the human enters the interior of the chamber, the door is sealed and locked while the external Geiger counter activates. SCP-2000-D will then bring the human to the most recent safe location where a human was deposited after deploying its radiation-absorbing modules to decontaminate the area.

It contains a padded surface with protrusions at the top and bottom that act as headrest and foothold, respectively. The chamber's interior is shielded against radiation and electromagnetism (beyond the protection offered by the polymer coating) and is sealed airtight when the door is closed. It contains numerous life-support systems, including temperature controls, a purified air circulation system, a scanner which gauges vital signs, and tubes which dispenses distilled water and nutrient cubes. Additional features appear to have been installed for comfort, including a dimmer switch for the light system, a set of sliding switches whose only purpose seems to be the activation and control of a humming noise of varying pitch, volume, and interval, and a device containing a canister of synthetic oil that infuses the purified air with the scent of roasted pork.

Unless the dimmer switch is turned to a high-luminosity setting, a projector will periodically present messages on the interior of the door at head level. These include statements such as "this is safe", "water is provided", and "you are almost a decontaminate". Questions will also be provided; these are followed by the protrusion of an on-board microphone toward the inhabitant. For a full report of statements and questions provided during testing (and answers given by subjects), consult Document 2000-D-4: Message Transcript. Examples include "who finally started it", "are you dying", "do you have any books", and "would you like to read". 

**SCP-2000-E** is an extraterrestrial research device. SCP-2000-E technology, broadcast parameters, and composition are similar to that of SCP-2000-D, and fully described in the attached Document 2000-E-1 (Materials Analysis).

SCP-2000-E is comprised of a series of interlocked segments of varying widths and lengths (average dimensions 4.7x11.9cm) with an ovoid central processing core measuring 15.6x8.8cm. Each is coated on the underside with dermic interaction points designed to inferface with the human neurological system. When SCP-2000-E encounters a human, it will extend a dermic interaction point forward and slowly attempt to make physical contact. If successful, it broadcasts into the subject a sound file in which a computerized voice offers to act as a cybernetic support device that provides the host with useful services without surgery or the use of needles. It then asks that, in exchange, the subject will allow the probe to harmlessly gather cerebral information. Finally, SCP-2000-E requests that the subject turn to face away from the probe, so that it may rest on the subject's back to interface with him or her. (On several occasions in testing, once contact was made, subjects turning to run were considered by SCP-2000-E to have accepted.)

SCP-2000-E's primary neurological interaction involves the recording of thoughts and sense data. It also provides a thought-activated heads-up display which provides physiological data, chemical analysis based on smell and taste, readable texts from an internal database of human fiction and nonfiction books (with one exception; see below), and a camera function which stores visual data for later viewing. Occasionally (at an average rate of ten times per day), the display will present one or more pictures or videos taken from previous sense data in order to record the subject's mental and physical reactions. 

This display is not compatible with existing intracranial devices, and provides much less functionality due to limited internet access; although SCP-2000-E appears to be capable of network connection, its bandwidth and compatibility are severely restricted by the modem cable required to do so, and use of the dialup function has reported to be extremely unpleasant due to noise level.

A text file is present in SCP-2000-E's data storage which, unlike others that have been loaded, is not of human origin. In the display's browsing menu, it is titled "Message, To Those Who Disable Transmitters, Sent". The text reads as follows:

> 
> Please clarify.
> 
> Your projections have continuously been of low utility to journalist assimilation program.
> 
> Your projections have been extremely inconsistent with recorded data of events.
> 
> Recorded data of events indicates majority developments not fully planned or accounted for.
> 
> Discrepancy priority one: Retention of planetary civilization.
> 
> If transmitters have been disabled: re-install.
> 
> If capable: record response.
> 
> Do you not understand yourselves?
> 
> Please clarify.
