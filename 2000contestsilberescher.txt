**Item #:** SCP-2000

**Object Class:** Zeno (Medium/Low), partially Liber (Uncontained/Low)

**Special Containment Procedures:** Contained SCP-2000 instances are to be contained in individual Faraday-insulated electronics/vehicle lockers (depending on appropriate size) in Site-65 and restrained with straps attached to the top, bottom, and rear wall of the locker to prevent motion. Earth's orbit is to be monitored for possible additional instances of SCP-2000; following recovery, data regarding the probe is to be concealed via AESIR protocol, and researchers are to disable and/or remove any transmission equipment present in the instance during initial experimentation if possible.

**Description:** SCP-2000 is a series of probes of extraterrestrial origin, designated SCP-2000-A to SCP-2000-E. These devices differ radically in external design, but their internal systems, transmission parameters, and other features indicate a common origin.

SCP-2000 instances record data using an array of sensory equipment. If capable, instances transmit this data via radio to what is believed to the their point of departure, which researchers hypothesize to be on or orbiting a planet or other body in the [REDACTED] system, located approximately 12.5 light-years from the Earth's sun. (See Document 2000-B, Astronomical Data.) The Foundation has disabled or removed the transmission devices from contained SCP-2000 instances when possible.

Due to human technological limitations, the data present on SCP-2000 instances is currently only partially understood. Researchers are capable of viewing recorded information, but cannot parse information presented in unknown languages in any meaningful way.

> __SCP-2000-A's description has been revised from the original document due to its lack of understanding of the object and its origins with a group that predates the SCP Foundation. The current version is dated 6/2017. Consult the attached Document 2000-A, "HMFSCP Containment Information".__

SCP-2000-A is a teardrop-shaped probe measuring 1.4 meters in diameter and coated in an 8 cm-thick layer of a pale-green polymer. A sample removed during analysis was demonstrated to be highly resistant to temperature changes, kinetic impact, chemical corrosion, and other forms of damage. In 1992, a request was made for funding to attempt to replicate SCP-2000-A's coating for Foundation use; this request was denied by the site director, as the substance cannot under any circumstances [REDACTED].

The outer coating is capable of being retracted in numerous places along the body, allowing for the use of a large central camera-like lens. The narrow section opens to allow material to be absorbed into the aperture, where it is analyzed and apparently disintegrated.

SCP-2000-A was recovered from an art gallery by Her Majesty's Fellowship for the Study of Curiosities and Phantasmagoria in Marseilles in 1897, where it had been modified and installed as part of an upcoming //salon des refusés// exhibition, following reports of involvement from the "Nous Avons Conclu Une Entente" art collective. 

Although SCP-2000-A's internal technology was not understood to any degree during initial containment, advancements in computer science allowed Foundation researchers to begin the process of reverse-engineering SCP-2000-A's storage drives in 1986. The majority of recorded information is printed materials, with a roughly equal ratio of fiction and nonfiction sources, notably a large collection of works of Edgar Allan Poe, H.G. Wells, and Jules Verne.

**Description:** SCP-2000-B is disguised as a zeppelin. It measures about  --6 feet-- 1.8 meters in length at its longest point. Its outer facade is made of copper, a fabric that looks like canvas but seems to be some sort of exotic nylon, and asbestos. Now looking inside, however, we find large torn scraps of the invulnerable plastic similar to the coating of SCP-2000, which is now called SCP-2000-A to match this new arrival. It seems to have shed its "skin" at some point. The "balloon" section of the craft is filled with machinery; the guts of the thing are similar to 2000-A's, and equally beyond human advancement. On the outside, a system of gears and levers protrudes from the bottom which appear to control a series of mechanical arms, but on closer examination, the arms seem to be powered through electricity, or a completely exotic power system. The purpose of the gears is unknown. 

The mechanical appendages that extend downward from the machine end in a variety of utensils, including mechanical hands wearing gloves made of white plastic, a secondary microphone and what looks like other recording equipment, scissors, a comb, and a mop. When deploying the mop, it holds the mop's handle with an extended grasping tool in a manner that somewhat emulates human use. When it is indoors and a human enters visual proximity, 2000-B deploys its mop and carries out cleaning behavior until the human exits the room or faces away from the machine. 2000-B can also provide haircuts on request, but it is totally incompetent at the task and collects the scraps of hair.

2000-B was discovered in Boston in 1939, two years after initial tracking of a "fast-moving cigar-shaped aerial object" began in the vicinity of Nantes. Eyewitness reports indicate that, when active, it flew at varying altitudes at speeds of up to --30 mph-- 48.2 kilometers per hour, sometimes darting around like a bird, and entered buildings to literally consume books and other printed media by pulling them up into itself. Foundation containment agents managed to trap it in a reinforced reading room.

Dictated by Doctor Olaf Murphy.

**Notes:** Although 2000-B was being handled at Area 12, it has been lost to the Foundation as a result of the Area 12 Director's defection to Margaret Zhou Chao's upstart "insurgency". The facility has been cut off from communication with Europe Site 1 by radio, telegraph, etc., although reports have been received that Area 12 has radioed other facilities in the area seeking support. Any messages received from Area 12 are to be reported to a Communications Officer immediately.

2000-B has been declared a Priority 3 Uncontained Anomaly. Its ranking is relatively high due to the possibility that defectors may eventually replicate its technology, most notably the plastic substance that remained in small amounts on 2000-B.

**Addendum 3/1940:** A committee has been assembled at Europe Site 1 to examine the situation and prevent similar incidents in the future. Projects include new ethical regulations and the development of new test subject care provisions, including the experimental Class-D Amnestic.

> **Addendum 8/2044:** SCP-2000-B has not been recovered as of this time. It was reported "destroyed" in the Sydney Accord of 2022; however, the accuracy of these reports is heavily disputed due to the nature of certain anomalies under the control of the Afro-Pacific Storage Trust.]//

**Description:** SCP-2000-C is a humanoid automaton measuring approximately 2.2 meters in height. The object is encased in a self-pressurizing space suit, made of a thick, highly reflective foil believed to be a derivative of the material coating SCP-2000-A, except colored bright red with a vertical white stripe on each side of the suit's limbs. The torso and shins are plated with what superficially resembles chrome but has a similar composition to the SCP-2000-A substance, and the chest opens outward to reveal that most of the torso and backpack are a single large compartment as present in previous versions of SCP-2000. The transparent face-covering visor has not been analyzed due to concerns of shattering it.

SCP-2000-C's head is made with the same chrome substance, and superficially resembles a human's, with a highly-detailed, angular mouth and jaw and eye-shaped ovals. It is capable of speech, in a sense; the object will reply to prompts in English, French, and Russian with relevant prerecorded messages in a computerized voice using the language in which the prompt was made.

The machine's palm contains a retractable radio antenna measuring roughly 70cm in length. When extended, it is capable of moving objects at a distance without physical contact, powering electrical devices, and transmitting pre-recorded messages directly to radios, television sets, and certain metal objects. These "radio beams" have no apparent maximum range and cause significant communications interference in the area.

> **<Begin Log, 11/5/1968, 14:28>**
>  
> **Interviewer:** Where did you come from?
> 
> **SCP-2000-C:** There is a traveler from beyond the stars: gleaming, hopeful. He understands your experiences with such spacemen have caused much suffering; he pleads welcome, disarmed, and approaches the local library.
> 
> **Interviewer:** What is your purpose here?
>  
> **SCP-2000-C:** Mouth dry with the fullness of creation, he, a simulation of a billion hearts before him, tastes truth, justice, and the American way as he longs with tight anticipation for the bookstore or magazine stand closest to your house.
>  
> **Interviewer:** Why do you care about books?
>
> **SCP-2000-C:** He stood on the cusp of an immense evolution, wheeling before the thoughts of a generation like sandpaper on fire, but he needed to know the future, and the prognosis which leapt, tigerishly, like the lions of Daniel before him was: forward.
>  
> **Interviewer:** Who created you?
> 
> **SCP-2000-C:** Hurtling, Earthward, through the cold, from a distant, though not dissimilar, world, seeking the light of truth, with peace, the peace of wisdom, in their hearts, as they were, one of great minds, to read the predictions, prescient and euphonious, made, by his own hand, of man, yet beautiful, void of space came the traveler.
> 
>  **Interviewer:** Predictions?
> 
> **SCP-2000-C:** He saw that they had legends written of that which had not yet come to pass; and while those who had come before him and used them as a stopgap measure, a compensation, like a smooth gin martini, to account for the delays of transit, to let him blend in with the cities of mankind, years away, but there was priceless there, the brilliance of your soothsayers, this talent and so quickly in the fall of time.
> 
> **Interviewer:** Who are these soothsayers?
> 
> **SCP-2000-C:** //[repeats the previous statement]//
> 
> **Interviewer:** Alright. What do you mean, "delays of transit"?
> 
> **SCP-2000-C:** //[repeats the previous statement]//

The object was recovered from a military base in California in 1968, with the cooperation of the US Army. According to reports, it was being kept as a mascot of sorts by a group of religious youths who were camped in front of a NASA base. The loiterers were arrested by military police for causing a disturbance and interfering with military communications, presumably as a result of SCP-2000-C's activity.

The group was questioned individually, and detained on suspicion of being Communist spies.[[footnote]]According to ██████████, the officer who presided over the interrogation: "We had no idea what they were doing. Protesting? Partying? They were too hopped up on something to make sense. All we could puzzle out was that they were obsessed with the space program and they were with the 'Fifth'. 'Fifth' what? We assumed 'Fifth Column' and phoned it in."[[/footnote]] After researching, the group was believed to have ties to a Russian socialist organization called the "Brotherhood Pyateristiva", a radical group whose stated goal is the creation of a "Fifth International" workers' union, and were arrested on several charges. SCP-2000-C was then retrieved for containment.

**Description:** SCP-2000-D is an autonomous extraterrestrial aircraft of similar composition and technological infrastructure to the three probes previously designated SCP-2000, including an outer coating of green polymer. Its design implies that SCP-2000-D was intended for use by humans or humanoids of similar shape and physiology to humans, albeit in an environment unlike any that is currently present on Earth.

SCP-2000-D is an oblate spheroid with a structure that consists of eight sealed cylindrical chambers arranged in a circular pattern around a central core. Each chamber has a door along the top which opens when effort is exerted in any direction upon its luminescent yellow handle. Each chamber is slanted upward at 34 degrees, measures 2.4 meters in length, and has a curved underside. The central core contains the operational systems of the machine. Audiovisual recording equipment extends from the bottom of the core, as well as grasping tools, scanners that indicate temperature and other environmental variables, a Geiger counter, an array of radiation-cleaning devices, and a tube which dispenses nutrient cubes.

In this article, "nutrient cubes" is the term used for the homogeneous, sterile cubes which are continuously internally generated by SCP-2000-D. These 25-gram green-tinted blocks contain a mixture of synthetic proteins, fats, and carbohydrates that is suitable for long-term human consumption. A test subject reported that nutrient cubes "taste like mint and salad dressing".

When SCP-2000-D encounters a human, it lowers itself to the human's eye level, begins to emit a low hum, and tilts so that one chamber is vertically upright and facing the human. The handle of the facing chamber then begins to glow with an intermittent pulsing pattern.  If the human does not grasp the door handle, SCP-2000-D will follow the human in this position for an average of 15 minutes before abandoning the procedure. The machine will also dispense nutrient cubes and offer them to the human at various stages in this process.

If the human enters the interior of the chamber, the door is sealed and locked while the external Geiger counter activates. SCP-2000-D will then bring the human to the most recent place where a human was deposited after deploying its radiation-absorbing modules to decontaminate the area. If the area has become hazardous, it will search for the nearest safe location, then tilt and open to allow the subject to exit. If the subject refuses to exit for 60 seconds, SCP-2000-D will first offer a nutrient cube using the external delivery tube; after an additional 60 seconds, SCP-2000-D will slowly tilt forward until the inhabited chamber is parallel with the ground. SCP-2000-D will then rapidly move approximately 80 cm up and down, repeatedly, until the subject is expelled.

It contains a padded surface with protrusions at the top and bottom that act as headrest and foothold, respectively. The chamber's interior is shielded against radiation and electromagnetism (beyond the protection offered by the polymer coating) and is sealed airtight when the door is closed. It contains numerous life-support systems, including temperature controls, a purified air circulation system, a scanner which gauges vital signs, and tubes which dispenses distilled water and nutrient cubes. Additional features appear to have been installed for comfort, including a dimmer switch for the light system, a set of sliding switches whose only purpose seems to be the activation and control of a humming noise of varying pitch, volume, and interval, and a device containing a canister of synthetic oil that infuses the purified air with the scent of roasted pork.

Unless the dimmer switch is turned to a high-luminosity setting, a projector will periodically present messages on the interior of the door at head level. These include statements such as "this is safe", "water is provided", and "you are almost a decontaminate". Questions will also be provided; these are followed by the protrusion of an on-board microphone toward the inhabitant. For a full report of statements and questions provided during testing (and answers given by subjects), consult Document 2000-D-4: Message Transcript. Examples include "who finally started it", "are you dying", "do you have any books", and "would you like to read". 

When the second question was asked in testing, a "yes" answer resulted in SCP-2000-D immediately ejecting the subject from the bottom of his chamber. (Note: authorization requests for testing with dying subjects were denied.) In the instance when the third question was asked, a slot opened in the inhabited chamber which revealed a compartment; the words "insert, please, here" were projected. In the last example, the test subject was instructed to answer "yes", and the projector switched to an image of text which was determined on later analysis to be //The Sirens of Titan//, a novel by Kurt Vonnegut; however, the text was not legible to the test subject due to the extremely small typeface used in projecting the novel in its entirety.

**Description:** SCP-2000-E is an extraterrestrial research device. SCP-2000-E technology, broadcast parameters, and composition are similar to that of SCP-2000-D, and fully described in the attached Document 2000-E-1 (Materials Analysis).

SCP-2000-E is comprised of a series of interlocked segments of varying widths and lengths (average dimensions 4.7x11.9cm) with an ovoid central processing core measuring 15.6x8.8cm. Each is coated on the underside with dermic interaction points designed to inferface with the human neurological system. When SCP-2000-E encounters a human, it will extend a dermic interaction point forward and slowly attempt to make physical contact. If successful, it broadcasts into the subject a sound file in which a computerized voice offers to act as a cybernetic support device that provides the host with useful services without surgery or the use of needles. It then asks that, in exchange, the subject will allow the probe to harmlessly gather cerebral information. Finally, it requests that the subject turn to face away from the probe as a gesture of acceptance. (On several occasions in testing, once contact was made, subjects turning to run were considered by SCP-2000-E to have accepted.)

When a subject has accepted, SCP-2000-E will press against the subject's back, contouring itself to their musculature and oriented so that the central core is mounted at the top of the back. It secures itself with hooks that allow it to rest on the subject's neck and shoulders, although the propulsion system still operates, making the probe effectively weightless while installed.

SCP-2000-E's primary neurological interaction involves the recording of thoughts and sense data. It also provides a thought-activated heads-up display which provides physiological data, chemical analysis based on smell and taste, readable texts from an internal database of human fiction and nonfiction books (with one exception; see below), and a camera function which stores visual data for later viewing. Occasionally (at an average rate of ten times per day), the display will present one or more pictures or videos taken from previous sense data in order to record the subject's mental and physical reactions.

This display is not compatible with existing intracranial devices, and provides much less functionality due to limited internet access; although SCP-2000-E appears to be capable of network connection, its bandwidth and compatibility are severely restricted by the modem cable required to do so. Test subjects also reported that the sound of SCP-2000-E's dialing up was extremely unpleasant, especially due to its transmission to the subject directly through aural nerves. Additionally, several display aspects are apparently nonfunctional, including a "bullets remaining" counter which has never displayed an output other than "00" and an indicator which claims to detect whether the user is inside a dream or simulation; this indicator has never displayed any output other than a blue circle.

A text file is present in SCP-2000-E's data storage which, unlike others that have been loaded, is not of human origin. In the display's browsing menu, it is titled "Message, To Those Who Disable Transmitters, Sent". The text reads as follows:
