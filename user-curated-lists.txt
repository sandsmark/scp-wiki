+ Intro

Hello and welcome to the SCP-wiki's User-Curated Lists page! Since we've got such a large volume of content on this site (7,900+ works as of February 2019), this page has been created to offer the readership a hub containing quality representative material for their reading pleasure. This is to be a collaborative page.


+ Ambassador Articles

Get to know the Foundation with these lists for new or returning users! Interested parties should also check out the [[[scpdeclassified|SCPDeclassified Hub]]], which has in-depth essays on individual SCPs and different facets of SCPverse lore. Readers may also be interested in [[[heritage-collection-arc|Heritage Collection]]], a small list of early, well-known SCPs.

[[tab Mario's SCP Starter Pack]]

The SCPs I'm gonna link require minimal to no earlier knowledge and are pretty well written, so I think they'll be good for new users.

(Some people forget to do this, but remember to read the various Incident Logs and other Addenda in the article, that's where the "meat" of the article is).

[[collapsible]]

[[[SCP-093]]] Red Sea Object by far2, rewritten by NekoChris

> This one is a classic, but it is very long. If you don't think you can handle a long read right off the bat, come back to this later.

[[[SCP-096]]] The Shy Guy by Dr Dan

> If you expected the SCP wiki to be a creepypasta site, then this guy should be right up your alley. Short and easy to digest.

[[[SCP-1425]]] Star Signals by Silberescher

> In a complete U-turn from the earlier entry, if you expected the SCP wiki to be a creepypasta site, this is absolutely not what you expected to read. Medium-sized read. (Before you ask, GOI stands for Group Of Interest, AKA any other group/organization the Foundation is interested in)

[[[SCP-1440]]] The Old Man From Nowhere by Dmatix

> Short, sweet, and folklore based. After reading, you have to read the tale "[[[Thrice]]]".

[[[SCP-1733]]] Season Opener by bbaztek

> Not all SCPs have to be a threat to human life in order to be interesting. Short read.

[[[SCP-2006]]]  Too Spooky by weizhong

> This SCP initially seems sillier and more lighthearted than the rest, but don’t let that fool you. Short read.

[[[SCP-2662]]] c'thulu f'UCK OFF by SoullessSingularity

> Comedy! We missed you here! (Short read)

[[[SCP-3001]]] Red Reality by OZ Ouroboros

> This time around, it's not the SCP itself that gets the spotlight. Long read.

[[[SCP-3008]]] A Perfectly Normal, Regular Old IKEA by Mortos

> Lighthearted and funny, but still interesting. Short-Medium read.

[[[SCP-3199]]] Humans, Refuted by bittermixin

> To close this off, how about we go back to a classic creepy monster? Medium-Long read.

[[*user djkaktus]]

[[[SCP-1739]]] "Obsolete Laptop" by Chubert

> I maintain that this should be a benchmark for anyone who wants to write here. It's not overly complicated, it doesn't do more than it needs to, and it's incredibly well written.

[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/kalinins-proposal| Kalinin's Proposal]]] - "Past and Future" by Kalinin

> yeah so it's not a true tale. Who cares. In my opinion, it's the best proposal on the site and one of the best series I've read here, ever. There is so much fridge horror here the TV Tropes page should just link to it.
-----
[[*user Shaggydredlocks]]

[[[SCP-2935]]] "'O, Death" by djkaktus

> Truly, a treat for those both new and old. It seems perfectly suited for those with only cursory knowledge of existing lore/returning users. Couple this with the fact that it is expertly written, with realistic dialogue and characters, a dread-inducing and suspenseful plot, and a harrowing, gut-wrenching conclusion, it goes without saying that this is a must-read.

[[[We Need To Talk About Fifty-Five]]] by qntm

It's the introduction to what is one of the best series this site has. An incredible high-concept with mind-boggling twists and turns; a thrilling series I'd be happy to have representing the kind of place the SCP wiki is.
-----
[[*user Weryllium]]

[[[SCP-2380]]] "The Left Kidney of Junior Researcher Østergaard" by BIDZ180

> I highly recommend this article to any aspiring author or curious reader. There's several things it has going for it. It's a very unique and creative concept, first of all. It's a kidney, rather than the common eyeballs, fingers, hearts, etc. we see here and elsewhere. It uses the often-maligned compulsion effect and gets away with it due to the fun imagery it creates, showing that even the most commonly-spouted slogans can be overruled with enough skill.
> 
> It's a short article, which is always nice, and tells a lot in that small space while leaving a lot to the imagination (But not too much). It has no convoluted backstory, GOI/canon linkage, or superfluous interview logs, because it doesn't need any of those to hold its concept up for it. In my opinion, it's a shining example of what an SCP is at its most fundamental. An entertainingly weird thing, what it does, and how the Foundation deals with it.
-----
[[*user psul]]

[[[SCP-882]]] - A Machine by Dr Gears

> This gets the nod over the other contenders (and because 173 had already been taken!) for several reasons. It's relatively short, but it has a supplement to flesh things out and show off more dramatic writing. It is a unique item, and it has correspondingly interesting containment procedures. It is creepy, but not unnecessarily gory. It is self-contained (and doesn't require any background knowledge as to, for example, what an MTF is) but it has several cross-links to take readers further into the database. It's exactly what I'd suggest to draw a hypothetical new reader into this world.

[[[Shadow of a Doubt]]] by Dr Yucatan

> For me, this was a no-brainer. It perfectly sets out the Foundation world without the need for any background knowledge, providing an understanding of the shared universe, rather than assuming it (as most tales do). Even SCP-017 is neatly explained in-text. It highlights the human element, setting up characters the reader can invest in. And it creates a marvelous atmosphere of high tension which should leave the reader wanting more. It's really great - you should read it!
-----
[[*user mlister]]

[[[SCP-2498]]] "The Rainbow Body" by minmin

> Not the best article for a newbie, but in my opinion, it's perfect for showing off how vast a singular SCP can be. The article explores paratech, alt-history, and religion, all while balancing a detached overview with raw emotion. It's a self-contained story, yet it can serve as a springboard in the Coldest War canon. It's beautiful at times, yet there's an ominous undertone. It's a very personal story, yet it has global implications. I think this SCP shows just how large of a story you can craft while keeping the format perfectly intact.

[[[wowwee-go-kill-ursefl]]] by Randomini

> A bite-sized tale that exemplifies good character, good pacing, and good dialogue without any connections to the greater universe. It shows that there's more to the Foundationverse than the Foundation or even anomalies, and it serves as a springboard to Randomini's Acidverse.

[[[The Conspiracy Of Sigma 3]]] by thedeadlymoose

> The Serpent's Hand, being one of the more recognizable GoI's, makes for a perfect introduction to the GoI Format concept. That aside, the article does a good mix of worldbuilding while telling a story, and it ultimately shows another creative way to break the format.
-----
[[*user Scorpion451]]

[[[SCP-2447]]] "Modular Animals" by Eekium

> A highly underrated article showing the Foundation doing what it does best: capturing things that make you look up the word "exenterate", and defanging them through a combination of careful experimentation and literal duct tape. The subtle allusions to traits that have been programmed out of these critters and the well done containment log are a clinic in telling stories, implying threat, and inserting a little dark humor between the lines of a document without breaking tone.

[[[Hypervelocity]]] by A Random Day

> A brilliant example of embracing the site's potential to plow through genre boundaries like a post-apocalyptic war machine: a character-centric cyberpunk-urban fantasy-noir-action-thriller-heist with rich imagery and a semi-realist anime vibe that fully lives up to its title.

[[[uiu-file-1997-007|UiU File: 1997-007]]] by SpectralDragon

> A great little article that perfectly sums up the UIU: an organization of competent agents doing their best to uphold the law on both sides of the masquerade… armed with a shoestring budget and an unflappably deadpan approach to the insanity of the SCPverse.
-----
[[*user Leveritas]]

[[[SCP-3008]]] "A Perfectly Normal, Regular Old IKEA" by Mortos

> One of the articles I use as an example when critiquing, specifically on how an SCP can be a story rather than just a document describing an anomalous object. It's an important example on how the format has evolved since we began.

[[[dread-circuses-hub|Dread & Circuses]]] (series) by DrChandra/various

> Because of the interesting perspective from different GOI's and simply because of the sheer writing quality.
-----
[[*user Modern_Erasmus]]

[[[SCP-2747]]] "As below, so above" by minmin

> Arguably the best use of meta-narrative on the site. Manages to have a great narrative of its own while emulating other famous writers in the list of deleted works. Also some plot elements like project Lucid Chalice were brilliant in and out of universe.

[[[Resurrection]]] (series - various authors)

> One of the longer and more ambitious canons, it gives a great view of a modernized depiction of series 1 characters and tropes. Sadly unfinished, but includes many great moments and smaller scale stories.

[[[KTE-2013-Kapala-Mendes]]] MegalomaniacInchworm

> Fantastic article that combines a varied and entertaining plot, great worldbuilding, and a very interesting and threatening concept. Very underrated
-----
[[*user 9Volt]]

[[[SCP-1730]]] "What Happened to Site-13?" by djkaktus

> This SCP is the longest on the site, and is a great example of how to write a good story. This references many other SCPs so it wouldn't be the best first SCP to read. However, I would put it on the list of stuff for new members to read. It does a good job at establishing atmosphere, has fun action, and comes with many memorable moments. I would go into more detail about what this does right, but I'd rather not spoil it. You can take away a lot from what this does right in telling an effective narrative without becoming stale, and reading this would help with that.
-----
[[*user The Great Hippo]]

[[[SCP-2740]]] "It Wasn't There" by djkaktus

> I've crooned about this in the past, but just to briefly hit all the major points: Excellent premise, excellent picture, excellent interviews, excellent twist. It's emblematic of what I think made the series I skips work so well — a simple yet simultaneously incomprehensible idea coupled with a pervasive sense of building dread and just a pinch of 'wtf'. It also introduces new readers to the idea that something doesn't have to be physically dangerous (or, indeed, anything at all) to still be terrifying.

[[[Until Death]]] by psul

> I mean, c'mon. It actually manages to make SCP-106 legit scary. Seriously though, the reason I bring this up as a tale to show new readers is because it does what some of the best tales always do — takes an old idea, dusts it off, and injects some new life into it. Obviously, not all tales should seek to do this — you can only re-imagine an SCP so many times before it starts to get tedious. But you should show readers at least one tale that re-imagines an SCP… and if you're gonna show 'em one, this is a pretty great one to go with. Plus, it introduces them to SCP-106 and SCP-3001 — two for one shot!.
-----
[[*user WrongJohnSilver]]

[[[SCP-342]]] "A Ticket To Ride" originally by name rewritten by DrClef

> There are so many good answers for this, but I'm recommending this one in this case because it is a good introduction into the world of SCP. In the end, it's the story about one man's quest to understand one object, and that object's quest to destroy the man's effort. It is that tale, told simply and intimately, with visuals ranging from the anomalous effect, life inside and outside the site, relations between people, all the elements to make the full story moving.

[[[xiupania|#Xiupania]]] by Faminepulse

> What I like about this is that it takes advantage of the online format to tell its story, while at the same time remains literary in nature. It relies on words to tell its story and the formatting elements are simply there for immersion and context. The reader is introduced to the concept of many different ways of viewing the world beyond one's personal experience, leaving the reader more mindful of, well, just about everything.
-----
[[*user Petrograd]]

[[[shaggydredlocks-proposal|S.D. Locke's 001 Proposal]]] by shaggydredlocks

> I was trying to think of SCPs that affected me emotionally, for better or for worse. This is a fantastically told story using (if twisting) the SCP format, and the last one that really scared the shit out of me.

[[[The Only Way To Travel]]] by Djoric

I'm recommending this one for two reasons. First, I think it was one of the first articles that really showed me that there were different perspectives on what the Foundation could be, and it was up to me to pick exactly what I wanted to believe. Secondly, it's just so goddamn fun.
-----
[[*user Roget]]

[[[SCP-1370]]] "Pesterbot" by Sorts

> A classic from one of the Masters, Sorts, this is a light-hearted but still sinister article which covers a lot of character in a small amount of space. If you like fun articles that make you think you can't go wrong here.

[[[Brink Dangerguts Adventures]]] by thattallfellow

> Fun pulpy action with great pace and written in a breezy easy to read style. Plus it has the best main character name ever.

[[[Recruitment Drive 28126]]] by tretter

> This is one of the more unique and original goi format articles through its attempt to strike out new characterization for the Factory. It's a little controversial but anything that broadens an old group's horizons is a great thing.
-----
[[*user Communism will win]]

[[[SCP-1981]]] "RONALD REAGAN CUT UP WHILE TALKING" by Digiwizzard

> One of the most popular articles on the site for a reason — it's fucking spooky, it has good pictures, and the writing is entertaining. Plenty of articles are like that, but this makes a good introductory article for a few reasons. Mechanically, it's simple: it's a tape with content that varies between playbacks, but is generally similar, and then something weird happens to cap it off. This overarching structure is very common on the site, and 1981 exemplifies it without being terribly long. The writing style and clinical tone is very typical for modern SCPs, and apart from leading off with its recovery story, doesn't really do anything atypical.
> 
> The article itself doesn't divulge much about the Foundation beyond that which is inherent to the format. There are Sites where the Foundation keeps things, information is hidden behind censor bars or REDACTED, they administer 'amnesiacs', there are Level 3 psychiatric evaluations and Level 4 supervisors and O5 clearance and blah blah blah. None of that should be terribly difficult to swallow, especially because it all could have come from the Men In Black movies, but it does establish what sort of organization the Foundation is and how they operate.

[[[Log of Anomalous Items]]] (collaboration - various users)

> SCP-1981 covered 'scary' and 'mysterious', and once a new user has familiarized themselves with the basic premise of the Foundation, the Log will cover 'weird' and 'mundane' (w/r/t the Foundationverse and the Foundation, respectively), along with a dose of humor. and a little bit of everything else, too. The better parts will demonstrate that brevity is the soul of wit, and that a shitload of brevity is the soul of an addictive read (and also like, Experiment Logs and whatnot, whose pacing the Log represents really well).
> 
> If their foray into SCPs hasn't conveyed the idea yet, the Log will really nail down the Foundation's nature as pack rats, bureaucrats, and pragmatists with a global reach and great intel.
-----
[[*user trennerdios]]

[[[SCP-1715]]] "Online Friend" originally by ObserverSeptember, rewritten by PeppersGhost

> Because I think PeppersGhost should be represented on here; most of his articles would be great for new readers as they tend to be the perfect combination of absurd and creepy, without being intimidatingly lengthy.

[[[Mission Statement]]] by Dr Reach

> It's the only tale on the site that's ever made me feel truly emotional, and I personally don't feel that prior knowledge of the Foundation is needed to appreciate the beauty of the writing. Newbies should be able to see that we have true talent here.

[[tab Format-Screws]]

For all the fun and interesting ways the standard SCP format is twisted and subverted.

[[collapsible]]

[[[SCP-2521]]] -- ●●|●●●●●|●●|● by [[user LurkD]]

> The most popular format screw on the wiki, and a great jumping off point. All images.

[[[SCP-3999]]] -- I Am At The Center of Everything That Happens To Me by [[user LordStonefish]]

> If you're wondering why the majority of format screw SCPs in this list are from series four, this is your answer. SCP-3999 showed the wiki just how far you can get from a standard SCP purely for the purpose of high-quality writing. Chock full of dream logic and word salad. Rather controversial.

[[[SCP-3043]]] -- Murphy Law in… Type 3043 — FOR MURDER! by [[user The Great Hippo]]

> MURPHY LAW! Stylistically, SCPs are supposed to be analytical and scientific. Lets see what happens when that gets subverted.

[[[SCP-3972]]] -- "Ken Burns Presents: SCP-3972" by [[user Kate McTiriss]]

> "The first person who figures out how to effectively incorporate video into an article, in a way that not only makes sense but is reproducible, is going to walk away from the wiki with like, a thousand million up votes. Mark my words." -DjKaktus. 3972 doesn't have quite as many upvotes as that, but is still an effective utilization of the video format.


[[[SCP-3939]]] -- [NUMBER RESERVED; AWAITING RESEARCHER] by [[user Croquembouche]]

> Remember those choose your own adventure books that you read as a kid? This is one of those. Try going through multiple times.

[[[SCP-2439]]] -- [SLOT UNALLOCATED] by [[user Jack Ike]]

> Tied winner of the 2016 D-Class contest. For an extra treat after reading, copy and paste the text into a separate document. 

[[[SCP-3211]]] -- There is No Canon by [[user Croquembouche]]

> This one throws you off balance right from the start, be prepared.

[[[SCP-2786]]] -- The Archetype by [[user Billith]]

> There are a lot of SCPs that change over multiple iterations, yet this one stands out due to the effectiveness of its execution. 

[[[SCP-3626]]] -- Do not stop reading this document by [[user kemoT01]]

> Similar to 3211, this SCP demands a certain level of commitment from the reader. All you have to do is not stop reading it.

[[[SCP-3309]]] -- Where We Go When We Fade, Fade Away by [[user FloppyPhoenix]] and [[user PhamtomGuy]]

> Pataphysics is the general concept that the characters created within a fictional narrative act as real consciousnesses that are aware of the narrative that they are placed within and an authors writing effects them just as it would effect a real consciousness. Be sure to leave a comment.

+ How to Contribute

This page is meant to be expanded based off community input. Anyone may submit a proposal for articles they wish to see displayed. Here's how it works:

* Proposals must contain at least 10 articles. Longer lists may be submitted, but the total number of works must be in multiples of 10 or 25 for nice, even lists.
* Individual lists should adhere to a certain "genre", or "category" of articles. For instance, lists of "Top Mythological SCPs" "Top Cute SCPs" "Top Picks for New Readers" etc. This is to make things easy for people looking for particular content - we don't need thirty generic "Favorite SCPs" list because that shit will get redundant fast.
* Look at what has come before. See if what you're going to propose isn't a heavy retread of an earlier list from another user. Some repeats are fine. This is to only cut down on multiple lists that would otherwise be wholesale regurgitation of content.
 * Feel free to propose an expansion for an existing list, though.
* Articles should be listed with their title and author.
* Lists are locked-in once incorporated onto the page. Users should not change or remove works that have already been included.
  * Only minor edits (formatting fixes, correcting attribution, SPaG) are permitted.
* Users may include blurbs for articles they choose, and they may include their reasoning for their inclusion.
* No articles can be included if they are part of an active contest.

Proposals for similar content may be combined or changed at the discretion of yours truly. 

If you would like to propose a new or expanded list, comment here with your selects. If you get the go-ahead, draft your list up and add it to the page!
