__Rufus' Diary__

**Day 1**

//Well it finally happened, I got hired! I actually can’t believe it! Mind you every other studio was interested in me, but obviously not for the right reasons. I mean all they ever did was fucking swarm around me like bugs. I’ve finally found a brand that appreciates me for who I am. As a writer and an artist, I’ve found a company that actually lets me express myself; I get to live the dream. Fuck everyone who said I couldn’t do it.//

**Day 43**

//Working for the foundation is pretty much everything I thought it would be and more. Not only are they giving me practically everything I think I could ever need as a writer, but they’re also giving me a place to live, free food, and well… pretty much everything is free. In a society like this, free anything is so damn rare, so this feels pretty fucking fantastic.//

**Day 216**

//I love this job, but that isn’t going to stop me from missing my friends back home. I know I’ve finally hit the jackpot, but I guess you can’t have your cake and eat it too.// 

**Day 258**

//It was a tough call, but I’ve decided that I’d rather be able to have the company of my friends and family than write for these people. Sure they’ve treated me well, but it’s as though I’m always working. There are never any breaks. Writing is my passion, but that doesn’t mean I want to do it literally 24/7. They treat my writing like crack. I know it will be a let down for the foundation, but I gave them my one weeks notice. I was pretty sorry about it too.// 

**Day 265**

//This is fucked up. I tried to leave the building today, but I couldn’t even leave my room. My fucking office door is locked from the outside. I called for help all fucking day, but nobody came. I know they fucking heard me too. Some fucking asshole walked by the glass and didn’t even acknowledge me. There’s got to be some kind of law against this bullshit right?// 

**Day 268**

//This is some kind of fucked up cult. These people are addicted to my goddamn writing. They pretty much worship it. Every word I write they take and literally discuss for hours. I’ve seen them do it through the glass. I’ve tried escaping, but the walls, door, and even the fucking glass are solid. We’ll see how much they worship my writing when it is shit.//

**Day 279** 

//I don’t understand the infatuation of these people with my literature… I handed in my latest work, “The MaNifeSto of FuK u ShitBags LET ME OUT OF HERE”. They literally gave me no fucking reaction; they ate it up just like they did with all my other works. Fuck my life. I just want to go home.//

**Day 318**

//These fucking assholes forgot to feed me today. It’s as if they haven’t ruined my life enough by fucking imprisoning me. Whats a giraffe gotta to do to get some fucking sustenance?//
