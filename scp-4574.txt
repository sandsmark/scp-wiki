**Item #:** SCP-4574

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** The land surrounding SCP-4574's cave has been acquired and marked as an archaeological site. Guards are to maintain a perimeter around SCP-4574's cave and turn away any trespassers, amnesticizing as needed. 

**Description:** SCP-4574 are two animate conglomerations of primitive spears, handaxes, clubs, and javelins, each in the shape of a //Smilodon//.

Both instances of SCP-4574 appear male, with the larger of the two designated SCP-4574-A and the smaller SCP-4574-B. The weapons comprising SCP-4574 are of similar craftsmanship, and many are decorated with feathers, leather strips, carvings, or dyes. The majority (~80%) of these weapons share similar compositions, and collectively date to approximately 13,000 BC. The rest are assorted obsidian weapons of Mesoamerican make, two muskets, and a Spanish sword. 

SCP-4574 inhabit a large, partially submerged cave system in the state of Quintana Roo, Mexico. Cave paintings line the portions of the cave above water, dating to the same time period as the spears.

SCP-4574 guard the caves as a pair. They will not attack those who enter unless the intruder attacks them, or attempts to touch the cave paintings. Otherwise, SCP-4574 are relatively docile. They communicate with each other verbally in an indistinct language, and show signs of intelligence well beyond that of ordinary felines.
