**Item #:** SCP-848

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:**
SCP-848 is to be contained in an isolation chamber measuring at least 10m wide by 10m long and at least 5m high. The chamber is to contain several non-organic structures that may be used by SCP-848-1 to construct SCP-848-2.

SCP-848-1 generally does not need to be fed, but if SCP-848-1 is unable to feed for periods lasting greater than 2 weeks, or if specimens of SCP-848-1 begin to exhibit signs of malnutrition, harmless insects may be introduced to SCP-848's containment as food.

SCP-848's chamber should be cleaned at least once a week, and continuously monitored for anomalous objects. In the case of [DATA EXPUNGED], armed response teams may be deployed, and full Nuclear-Biological-Chemical (NBC) precautions should be observed when retrieving objects from SCP-848-2.

**Description:**
SCP-848-1 is a colony of //Nephila clavipes//, a golden silk orb-weaver or banana spider. Specimens of SCP-848-1 are approximately 15% larger and significantly stronger and faster than normal specimens of //Nephila//, but are generally no more dangerous than a typical spider of the genus. SCP-848-1 does not exhibit any particular hostility to humans in its containment.

SCP-848-2 is the web created by SCP-848-2. As with all webs of its kind, SCP-848-2 can be enormous, often times reaching 5 meters or more in width. The silk used in the production of SCP-848-2 is somewhat stronger than is normal for spiders similar to SCP-848-1 but otherwise appears normal.

Periodically, abnomalous objects will be discovered ensnared in SCP-848-2. The frequency of anomalous objects ranges from once per week to up to a dozen in one day. Recorded objects found in SCP-848-2 have included:

* Various flying insects typical to that of SCP-848-1's natural habit. To date, over 300 recorded species of flies, moths, and other insects have been logged.
* Various flying insects that only exist in regions of the world where SCP-848-1 is not known to populate, including exotic deep rainforest insects.
* Various kinds of scraps of inanimate objects, including paper and plant detritus.
* Several species of insect that are not known to modern science.
* Several unidentified organisms that quickly asphyxiated when exposed to oxygen, and may not be terrestrial in origin.
* [DATA EXPUNGED]
* [DATA EXPUNGED]

Anomalous objects will appear on SCP-848-2 despite having no plausible explanation for their origin, leading to the belief that SCP-848-2 is able to 'catch' objects from alternate universes and/or timelines. SCP-848-1 is able to feed on most insects found on SCP-848-2, and thus does not need to be regularly fed.

**Log of Anomalous Materials**
A list of significant anomalous materials has been compiled.

**Date:** █/██/████
**Details:** An unidentified insect appeared on SCP-848-2. The insect appeared to have twelve (12) legs, as well as an organ that could only be described as a "█████ █████". Specimen destroyed as a precaution.

**Date:** ██/██/████
**Details:** A [DATA EXPUNGED] with a wingspan of nearly 1 meter, known to have become extinct nearly ███ million years ago. Caused significant damage to SCP-848-2 before being neutralized by SCP-848-1's venom. SCP-848-1 later repaired the damage to SCP-848-2 without difficulty.

**Date:** ██/█/████
**Details:** A [DATA EXPUNGED], which began screeching loudly before quickly expiring from asphyxiation and explosive exsanguination from its eyes. An autopsy performed by Dr. ██████ determined that the creature was not capable of breathing oxygen, and in fact could not survive in an atmosphere with Earth-normal atmospheric pressure.

**Incident 848-1:**
On █/██/████, a [DATA EXPUNGED] materialized on SCP-848-2 and immediately breached containment using a █████ ███████████. The [DATA EXPUNGED] and [DATA EXPUNGED] before a Mobile Task Force was dispatched and managed to terminate the Subject after sustaining multiple casualties.

SCP-848 has been redesignated Euclid-class and revised containment procedures are pending review.
