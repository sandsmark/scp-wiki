[[size 125%]] **Special Containment Procedures:** [[/size]]

As SCP-5420's orbit is outside the orbit of Mars, active containment is currently impossible. A temporary alliance between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Foundation has been created in order to suppress public knowledge of as well as to explore SCP-5420. Through this agreement:
# SCP-5420 containment is to be put under the jurisdiction of Site-196, Foundation Home Base (FHB).
# SCP-5420-A is to be constantly observed by NASA-Foundation Probe 7-B.
# Foundation web-crawlers are to monitor any information regarding SCP-5420.
# The LANCER Project is to be established in order to determine the source of SCP-5420-A.

Probe 7-B is to be in geosynchronous orbit with SCP-5420-B in order to take scans of SCP-5420 every ten minutes; these scans are to be compiled into a video feed and archived in storage at FHB. FHB and NASA Central Command (CenCom) are to have joint control over the LANCER Project.

[[size 125%]] **Description:** [[/size]]

SCP-5420 is an asteroid in orbit between Mars and Jupiter, in the outer region of the Asteroid Belt. An analysis of SCP-5420 revealed that its orbit is slightly decaying - it has been theorized that SCP-5420 may have originated from the Kuiper Belt. The apogee of SCP-5420's orbit occurs approximately every 13 years; the One-Way Radio Time (OWRT) at this point is 5.1 minutes. However, SCP-5420's main purpose appears to be a vessel for SCP-5420-A. SCP-5420-A is a high-frequency radio signal which has yet to be meaningfully deciphered and has no auditory effect on humans.

Scans from Probe 7-B revealed a structure resembling a double-tiered mortuary temple from the Egyptian Middle Kingdom era, designated SCP-5420-B. SCP-5420-B appears to have been relief carved into a hill on SCP-5420, and a flight of stairs from the surface leads to the second tier. It also appears to continue subterraneously, although that cannot be confirmed at the present time.

The official NASA designations for SCP-5420 and related objects are below:
* SCP-5420: 1737 Meta
* SCP-5420-A: Meta Signal
* SCP-5420-B: Surface Anomaly 114-Y6
* Probe 7-B: Meta Probe Four
Foundation documentation will use the prior designations; NASA ones will use the latter.

[[size 125%]] **Item History:** [[/size]]

SCP-5420 and SCP-5420-B was discovered in early 1966 during primary surveying of Mars and surrounding bodies. It was originally designated Meta, the 1737th minor planet discovered. Meta's other anomalous properties (SCP-5420-A) were not known at that time.

SCP-5420-A was discovered during the tenure of the SETI program in the late 1970s; the Arecibo Observatory radio-telescope in particular. It was also at this time that long-range telescopic imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope was used to enhance the quality and confirm the presence of SCP-5420-B.

In 1980, a Foundation-NASA joint mission attempted to reach SCP-5420, but it was concluded that neither party had the expendable technology at that time to complete a round trip[[footnote]] The trip, according to the calculations performed, would have been approximately a four-month one-way trip; neither the technology nor information allowed for an accurate landing on SCP-5420 within an acceptable margin of error.[[/footnote]].

Probe 7-B was launched in 1992 and became fully operational in 1993.

+++ **1 - OBJECTIVE**
The purpose of the joint National Aeronautics and Space Administration and Foundation project  LANCER is to reach 1737 Meta using currently viable and replicable technology. The target date to land on Meta is on 13 September 2019, the apogee of its orbit. Meta Probe Four, the first probe launched to reach geosynchronous orbit over Surface Anomaly 114-Y6, can be used for both video monitoring of the Lancer landing as well as a radio projector. Although the failure of Lancer I in 1967 was in no part due to an untrained crew, a three-man crew of Foundation-affiliated NASA astronauts have been prepared.
@@ @@
+++ **2.a - LANCER PERSONNEL**
The crew will consist of the following:
* Paul Catani [Italy] - Commander
* Edward Yates [UK] - Meta Module Pilot
* Alan Milner [US] - Command Module Pilot
All three astronauts have varying level of specialties pertinent to landing on Meta. Cmdr. Catani is a trained module pilot and geology expert. Meta Mod. Pilot Yates is a biomedical technician and history/archaeology expert. Cmnd. Mod. Pilot Milner is a communications and engineering expert. Requisite training - including water egress - has been completed by all three. The Lancer crew will be armed with Foundation-produced MBA Gyrojets in case of defense purposes. A standard survival kit will be provided. Per NASA requirement, the Lancer crew will also be given a penetrometer and instructed to take soil samples. Crew will be fitted with Suit HR5, yellow-orange color scheme and smoked visors. Flashlights will also be mounted to the helmets for visibility.

+++ **3 - LANCER SPECIFICATIONS**
LANCER: (Overall) Three-stage rocket with double-part module.
The Paragon V rocket is approximately 2-3x more powerful than the Saturn V. The Lancer II craft is an experimental double-part nuclear-fission-powered rocket. Tubular-shaped, with cross-hatched support beams. Both modules have engines, although the command module has less thrust than the Meta module. The Meta module is able to be docked and undocked from the command module appropriately.
@@ @@
+++ **4 - TIMELINE OF LAUNCH**
The Lancer II launch is to be approximately 22 days previous to the orbital apogee (22. Aug. 2019) at Vandenberg AFB, California. Retrieval is expected to be on 10 October 2019: an independent craft will intercept Lancer II and return the crew to Earth.

Estimated plan of launch & retrieval:

1. Initial Launch
* Paragon V + Lancer II launch
* Paragon breakaway from Lancer II
2. Meta Operations
* Lancer II low orbit around Meta
* Command Module separation from Meta Module
* Meta Module to land on Meta with Cmdr. Catani and Yates
* Milner will stay on to keep the Command Module in low orbit
* Catani and Yates will perform soil checks and other NASA requirements
* Examination of Surface Anomaly 114-Y6
* All logs + results will be transmitted back at this time.
3. Return to Earth
* Radio contact will cease at this point
* The Meta Module will redock with the Command Module
* RTB approximately 26.13 days from return launch, 49 days since initial launch

Crew will check in for safety diagnostic checks at 11- and 36-day marks.

< Giazotto/Albinoni's Adagio in G Minor can be heard. >

**[LYTZ]** Oh, keep this on! This one's my favorite.

**[LCTI]** Not like we could change it, anyway. It's the only CD that works well enough.

**[LMNR]** I've actually started to like it. It's grown on me, I think.

**[LYTZ]** It has, has it? Good. Whaddya like about it?

**[LMNR]** It's awfully poignant, isn't it?

**[LCTI]** Tranquil. Almost serene.

**[FBHR]** I'm sorry Lancer, am I interrupting your music selection?

**[LYTZ]** Is that you, Doctor Bouchere?

**[LCTI]** Of course. Who else at Home Base has such a terrible sense of humor?

**[FBHR]** Very funny, Catani. Will you three go to your posts for module-check in? We're being routed through CenComm, so you'll be doing it with Penfold.

**[LCTI]** I'm in the command pilot seat right now. Ready for checks.

**[LYTZ]** I'm in Meta Module, ready for checks.

**[LMNR]** I'm at the diagnostics panel, ready.

**[FBHR]** Roger that. We'll be turning you over to CenComm. Should take about ten minutes. You can put on some of that fancy music on again.

**[LYTZ]** Oi, finally.

**[LCTI]** Finally what? I finally get to hear Albinoni for the thousandth time in a row?

**[LYTZ]** It's good!

< Adagio in G Minor starts. >

**[LMNR]** What do you like about it, anyway?

**[LYTZ]** Aye, just listen to it. It's peaceful.

< Contact is silent from the crew. >

**[LYTZ]** It reminds me of floating, weightless in space. Beautiful, but... just a sense of sadness, get it?

**[LMNR]** Almost half of all the people up here have died here. Space is a very sad place, even if you don't like to think about it. It's a sad place to die.

**[LCTI]** Have either of you considered the possibility that- well-

**[LMNR]** That we fail? Somewhat.

< Yates laughs. >

**[LYTZ]** I definitely have. Let's say we're unable to re-dock the Meta probe, unable to launch it, even. We're stuck on Meta until the end of eternity, three bodies in harmony.

**[LMNR]** If that happened, well, even if I tried to get back I wouldn't have enough power. I'd be drifting somewhere between Earth and Mars when I died.

**[LCTI]** I've always wanted to be buried.

**[LYTZ]** Aye?

**[LCTI]** Buried. When I die. Might be unusual for someone who's spent most of their life wanting to be in space. It is a place to live, not a place to die.

**[LMNR]** I'd have to agree with you there, Paul. Dying on Earth's very tangible. Drifting infinitely...

**[LYTZ]** Not exactly a great send-off, innit?

**[LCTI]** I'd very much like to get back to my family alive.

**[LYTZ]** You said it, mate.

**[CNCM]** Sorry for depressing you further, Lancer II, but we're ready and waiting for the diagnostic checks now.

**[LCTI]** Reading you clear, CenComm. We'll be doing them in the usual order: command, main, Meta. Ready, Ed?

**[LYTZ]** Ready as ever, Paul.

**[LCTI]** Alan?

**[LMNR]** All good, Paul.

**[LCTI]** Excellent. We're going to cut radio signal to align diagnostic checks in three... two... one...

**[LMNR]** Don't forget me, aye. Got me on mic?

**[YATZ]** Unfortunately.

< All three crewmates laugh. >

**[LMNR]** If audio cuts out, let me know. Pop a flare round if you have to.

**[CTNI]** If it does cut out, I'm wholly blaming you. You're the engineer in these desolate wastes.

**[YATZ]** The //only// engineer.

**[LMNR]** Yes, yes, if one of you take a hard spill, blame the guy in the capsule trying to maintain orbit for it.

**[YATZ]** Pints on me that Paul doesn't fall. If he does, he's paying.

**[CTNI]** As much as I'd love to banter, we've got a rough time schedule. Proceeding with time synchronization in three... two... one.... now. Timers set.

**[LMNR]** You two arrive before the time ends so I don't miss the module. God forbid I do, I'd have to apply the retrorockets and that's never pleasant.

**[YATZ]** We got it, pops. Be back home by curfew, not at curfew.

**[CTNI]** Better safe than sorry. It's in the deviation for testing anyway, so it shouldn't really matter.

**[YATZ]** Gotcha. Wish it were easier though, the lack of gravity's making this a real damn chore.

**[CTNI]** The 5420-B structure should be u-

**[YATZ]** 5420? Why so formal? Meta structure's a hell of a lot easier to say. We've been calling it that since the mission's started, anyhow.

**[YATZ]** It's like, err, well, it's like Hatchepsut's temple. That, but if it were made out of space rock and polished to a shine. Awe-inspiring.

**[CTNI]** I'll try to see if I can get the video feed working.

**[LMNR]** You won't; I've tried, believe me. Just take lots of photos like you were visiting Berlin again, you hear? I've got to see this.

**[YATZ]** It's truely magnificent. It's a damn shame you're not here.

**[LMNR]** Well, you do have to leave the best pilot be-

**[CTNI]** I know... I know. It gives us some freedom of movement... but I'm slightly uneasy. Let's get on with it.

**[CTNI]** It appears as if we are in a large chamber, like a foyer in a mansion. The walls are made with a slick black rock - I don't think this is natural-forming. Penetrometer's just dulling. The ramp didn't seem quite too long, but the ceiling here his vaulted approxmately ten meters or so.

**[YATZ]** Paul, there's some scribbles in the wall. I can't make anything out of them. You want to take a look?

**[CTNI]** Why not.

**[YATZ]** This place is spotless, just a bit dusty though.

**[CTNI]** What did you say?

**[YATZ]** I said it's... nothing, nothing. It's nothing.

**[YATZ]** I have no clue. That a good or bad thing, then?

**[CTNI]** Didn't say anything. Are you compromised, Edward?

**[YATZ]** Geesh, a bit rude.

< Adagio in G Minor can be heard throughout the craft. >

**[FBHR]** Lancer II, can you read us? We can hear some input from the ambient channel but not from your main radio.

**[CNCM]** Lancer II, do you copy?

**[FBHR]** Central Command, are you receiving any input?

**[CNCM]** Nothing from radio, Dr. Bouchere.

**[FBHR]** Anything we can do?

**[CNCM]** Hope and pray.

**[FBHR]** As much as I'd love to, O5-9's been getting on our asses about the project. I need good news. Can you get Penfold?

**[CPND]** You needed me, ma'am?

**[FBHR]** Yes. Can you send me readings of the Lancer crew's medical diagnostics? I need to package them up and send it to the higher-ups.

**[CPND]** The medical reports?

**[FBHR]** The medical reports.

**[CPFD]** About that, Bouchere... uhh, we're not getting any active medical reports from Lancer II.

**[FBHR]** Say that again?

**[CPFD]** I said we're no-

**[FBHR]** I heard the first time. Why isn't there anything coming in on the medical diagnostics?

**[CPFD]** Well, we //technically// are, but it's... it's just music.

**[FBHR]** Albinoni's Ada-

**[CPFD]** Adagio in- yeah. I don't know why it's only registering that. Try to see if you can break it to your boss lightly.

**[FBHR]** That's- hrm. I'll see what I can do about telling O5-9.

**[CPFD]** Funny they're so dedicated to this project. Didn't they vote against it?

**[FBHR]** I think they're looking for an excuse to shut it down.

< Silence. >

**[LNCR]** Albinoni Adagio?

**[FBHR]** Lancer? Lancer II, is that you? Lancer, can you repeat your last transmission?

[[size 200%]] **LANCER II FINAL REPORT** [[/size]]
------
[[/=]]
Lancer II touched down on October 10 in the Atlantic Ocean. Despite the stray from flight pattern deviations, the pilot capsule landed in an easily retrievable area. However, upon Foundation recovery crews arrival at the scene, the capsule was found to be mostly submerged. Medical and recovery teams acted quickly, but they were unable to save the lives of NASA/Foundation astronauts Paul Catani, Edward Yates, and Alan Milner. An investigation into the capsule's submergence revealed the capsule hatch had been opened from the inside; possibly a result of the astronauts' lack of water egress training.

Lancer II's recovery failure has been attributed to panic from the water submersion and possible 'psychological imbalance' leading to the immediate opening of the hatch - causing the drowning of the three crew members. This is corroborated by a signal from the capsule received seven minutes after impact[[footnote]] Cmdr. Catani and Yates pleading to "get us out of here" and that they "were trapped".[[/footnote]]. Fault has also been found in the radio logs sent/transferred by Meta Probe Four. A lack of an imaging system on the probe also contributed to misleading logs of Meta. Even in light of the unfortunate deaths of the Lancer crew, the "Mission to Meta" was overall a resounding success and provided fruitful in gaining invaluable data on SCP-5420.

An autopsy of the three astronauts was attempted, but due to the impossibility of removing the  corpses from the spacesuits, the official cause of death has been listed as drowning. The reason for the difficulties with the spacesuits is currently unknown. The spacesuit material was unable to be penetrated and the suit's seals could not be released. In accordance to the last wishes of the crew, the corpses of all three will be cremated and their ashes scattered into the ocean.

A proposal for another Lancer flight will not be attempted.
