//I must tell you this now, as I am growing old and the knowledge cannot die with me. The world as you know it is wrong. We are all passengers in a great craft, from which we will one day be released. I have seen it all, and know. There are things outside of us, that we cannot see or know. I have seen them, and I know them. Come closer, and be enlightened.//

> 
> Maybe Ed can roll around. He'll try that now.
> 
> Ed bumped. Well... there's always next time. Ed can just try again.

= //A few do not realize their own chaotic nature.//
