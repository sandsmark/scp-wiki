//Disciplinary Report://
//I told you it was going to happen eventually: Agent Rapp finally seems to have irritated the wrong guy. By special session, the Overseer council unanimously agreed to have Agent Rapp temporarily assigned as the head of [[[SCP-173]]]'s custodial staff. Reason given: "[http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/118200.html Attempting to Teach A Superior Officer to Suck Eggs].//

//Agent Rapp's response://
//Joke's on you- I can go WEEKS without blinking!//

//O5-11's addendum//
//I hope the canisters of tear gas we tossed into the chamber while you were staring at 173 will teach you to never try to get the last word in a pissing contest with the Overseer Council, Agent Rapp.//

//Rapp's reply://
//That was mean. :-(//
