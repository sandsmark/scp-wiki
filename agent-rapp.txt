//Disciplinary Report://
//I told you it was going to happen eventually: Agent Rapp finally seems to have irritated the wrong guy. By special session, the Overseer council unanimously agreed to have Agent Rapp temporarily assigned as the head of [[[SCP-173]]]'s custodial staff. Reason given: "Attempting to Teach A Superior Officer to Suck Eggs.//

//Agent Rapp's response://
//Joke's on you- I can go WEEKS without blinking!//

//O5-11's addendum//
//I hope the canisters of tear gas we tossed into the chamber while you were staring at 173 will teach you to never try to get the last word in a pissing contest with the Overseer Council, Agent Rapp.//

//Rapp's reply://
//That was mean. :-(//

And now...

**Dave Rapp's personal notes**
//(wedged in with my profile page, because the last time I made a separate page with just my own notes, I was informed that I should stfu)//

**Item #1-**
SCP-555. Every rewrite I try to do I end up making her into what we call a 'guy what fights good.' The problem is the basic idea isn't a whole lot more than that. I should watch the MIB TAS episodes with Alpha again, see what he had apart from fighting good. The most obvious thing to rip off would be something that steals or combines SCPs or something like that, although don't we already have some SCP that does that? Plus there's some groups of interest that already stole come of our SCPs. Bleh. 555 is a minefield of crap with a nugget of gold at the other end if I can reach it. Hope it's not pyrite. Did I spell pyrite right? Fuck it.

**Item #2-**
Holy shit that 354 exploratory mission thing came out good. I think the key to writing this stuff is to have every detail provided raise more questions than it answers. It keeps it from having no sustenance like that Jello thing I did, without having it end up with TMI like the tape. How can I apply this to the SCPs I've written so far? No fuck that, how do I apply this to SCPs I haven't written yet? Fuck where's that document where I typed down SCP ideas... 

Ooh. The magical store idea. Hmm. 

The fuck? "Permanent lightning" just sounds incredibly dumblamesucky. Deleting this one.

"Systematic elemination of agents." Okay that's not even an idea, that's for of 555. Fuck, I need to organize... god Wanted was a good movie. What?

Ick. I'm not even saying the words SCP-001 after that last fiasco. Better delete this one too.

Huh, I thought I had more things written down than that. Okay, back to the magical store idea then. Burned down building, okay, creepy. Containment? Eh, seems Safe but gods those wind up so boring... Could fall back on the old idea of having it draw in targets... no, lame. Should have some benefit to give the foundation reason to not just bulldoze it. Maybe you can get useful awesome shit from it but you can also get lost and die. Hmm. But then they'd never lose anything but D-class personnel. Needs some reason for us to send in actual people rather than disposables so there's some risk involved. Maybe it has something to do with desire. If you send in someone to get something for you, they just wind up getting what they want.

I should have it fuck up spacetime. Maybe it overstocks itself with items over time and if nobody goes in to get stuff out, it... explodes? Collapses into a black hole? Shuts down forever? Explodes? I kind of like explodes. Why would a store stuffed with more matter than it can handle explode. Crushing into a black hole makes more sense. I guess that would- wait, remember The Gods Themselves. Have the laws of physics fucked with. As it overstocks with abnormal items their abnormal properties... leak out? Reminds me of the pan dimensional vending machine. Things get more fucked up as they go along. But I don't want to rip that off. 

Why am I writing all this down? Fuck, I forget.

Still answering more questions than I'm asking. Need to work on that. Must be creepy.

If it manages to overstock itself, it will just data expunged. Don't explain it. Then go into detail about how the laws of physics in the general area are damaged. Ooh. And after it overstocks, the store relocates, which would cause a containment breach or worse. Brings back the idea of active containment rather than passive. We have to keep doing shit to keep it under control instead of just settings stuff up and leaving. Okay, now I think I've successfully dangerous'd it. But it's not cool yet. So, benefits. Does it... give you whatever you want? Meh, kind of lame. Does it... make you into something? Does it give you information? Maybe it has some of absolutely everything in it and you simply have to go find it. But... it's disorganized, no wait, it's not organized at all, and if you get lost you're stuck inside. No, lame. It's disorganized, and... for no reasons understood, people get lost inside. Let's say non euclidean geometry. I hope I know what that phrase means.

Ehh... 

Still needs work. Come back later.

**Item #3**
--Uh. Thought I had something else to talk about. Guess I got carried away with #2. Oh well.--

Okay, I've got some pretty good images here I can work with. We've got a really great picture of some old blue rubber gloves, discolored with age. Awesome. What can they do? It's tempting to have them grand some kind of ability to the wearer, but that's power-up/uberweapon territory and that's lame. Hmm...

We've got this creepy looking mermaid thing... dunno, creatures tend to come out lame. I should have it be a biproduct of something. Maybe a human effected by some SCP? Eh, that might turn into another thing what changes other things. 

Brick building covered in vegetation. Uh...

Come back to it.

Tree that looks like a woman. I think we already have one of those. Yep, it's in the 0'hundreds too. Crap.

Finally we have this... creepy... ass... doll. Hmmm... reminds me that one creepypasta from the chan. I don't want it to just kill people or drive them insane, that's obviously lame. And chucky-esque. The picture's all blurry and creepy on its own too... I have to fucking use this. I HAVE been trying to come up with something that could be a lv5 environmental threat since that guy did that threat level thing. Umm... No time shit, that's what the bug did. Does. Whatever. Have it fuck up stuff within a certain radius? How do we contain it. The containment would probably make it turn out weird. Maybe I should have it be alive too. No, again, chucky. Well, not really. I dunno kinda. 

It should indirectly make people suffering. Hey, then I can put "of suffering" its name. That'd be cool. Maybe it has effects within-

Ooh, hang on. Maybe I should have THIS be the terrible thing I alluded to in the latest edit of 354. It's a fucking DOLL and... Hmm. If I still plan on writing that event long thing, then it's a thing so terrible that we need three SCPs to kill it. This is getting lame though. I should scrap that idea, it wasn't flowing right anyway.

What was I talking about? Well, I guess what I really want is for it to be something that's more terrifying and destructive than anything else we've had so far. It's gotta be all in the writing. I remember the creepiness of Gears' 001 proposal was so fucking excellent, even though when you consider it for what it was the creature itself wasn't that amazing. 

Ooh. I want to be able to put the phrase "XK-class end-of-the-world scenario" in here somewhere. That phrase is just so fucking epic.

Okay, I'm getting carried away here. __Reel it in__. 

Creepy doll. Possibly emerges from 354. Possibly required MTF Ω-7 to deal with. Potentially an XK-class end-of-the-world scenario. Everything else is just "look at me I'm cool" so cut that stuff. Doll, 354, MTF Ω-7, XK. Those are the key bits.

Shites, is it 6:30 already? Guess I'm done for now.
