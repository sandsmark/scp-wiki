**Foreword:** This page is to document anomalous events that have attracted the Foundation's interests, but occurred too briefly for the Foundation to secure or contain them. Instead, the Foundation deploys a cover-up team to conceal the evidence from the public. This is merely a reminder to agents and researchers that not all of them can be contained.
-Agent Carriontrooper

**Event Description:** 3 civilians reported a glowing figure appearing in the center of a nearby lake, two cell-phone images supporting. There is no reason to believe the anomaly lasted longer than several seconds before abruptly disappearing.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** ██████ Lake Camp Grounds, ████████, USA
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Local media sources monitored, rumors involving the existence of a "lake ghost" disseminated. Special attention is to be paid to the region in the future.

**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** █████████, Nevada, USA
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Data suppressed, area to be monitored for future natural population spikes.

**Event Description:** Time skips between 2.5 and ██ hours take place in ████████████, North Carolina before normalizing to one day after initial skip. Non self-correcting electronic devices such as digital clocks are seemingly unaffected and display incorrect times at different areas of the town. Event bears similarity to a relatively unnoticed event in ███ █████, Nevada though no connection can be traced between the two events.
**Date of Occurrence:** █/██/████
**Location:** ████████████, North Carolina (███ █████, Nevada)
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Local news reports electromagnetic interference caused by local power plant. Small observation team assigned to area.

**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** ████████.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Population dosed with Class B Amnestics and a cover story was established.  A road accident with a Samson-Craig Products (an SCP front company) chemical tanker was staged, an emergency evacuation camp was arranged and the population given £███ per head compensation.  In the ██ years since there event there has been no recurrence or abnormal behaviour in the population.

**Event Description:** Three similar looking men were witnessed fighting in a gas station parking lot. Eyewitness reports maintain that each man claimed to be ██████ █████████, a well known local car salesman, and were fighting over which individual was the "true" one. Two of the men were killed when the third procured a crowbar. The third was fatally shot by a local police officer.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** █████, Oklahoma
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Witnesses and involved persons were questioned and given Class B Amnestics. Close family members of ██████ █████████ were questioned and given Class A Amnestics.

**Event Description:** Several students attending █████████ Collegiate began complaining about a loud buzzing noise. A custodian for the school located the source as a single monitor in the computer lab during his duties, and reported the power button was unresponsive. When the lab technicians arrived the next day, they unplugged the monitor after other attempts proved futile. Witnesses of the event report a scream playing through the computer's speakers, and the image of a digitized face screaming appeared for a moment before power was lost.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** █████████ Collegiate in the ██████, ████████, USA.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** The monitor was confiscated and replaced for inspection. Nothing of interest has been found.

**Event Description:** A mission not typically present was located in the MMORPG [REDACTED]. The mission was only accessible via a bugged area of terrain but had existed for an unknown period of time. The mission was an exact replica of Site-██ with several hostile SCPs (not necessarily those housed there) as opponents. No code for the mission was found on the game's server by Foundation Investigation teams.
**Date of Occurrence:** Unknown.  Detected ██/██/████
**Location:** Geographical location unclear.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** A viral attack on the server was made, resulting in a total shut down.  After the server was re-initialized the mission was absent.  All individuals known to have found the mission have been given Class A Amnestics.  There has been no recurrence to date.

**Event Description:** The entire stock of ███████ ███████ souvenirs at the ███████ ███████ stall on the ██████ waterfront were spontaneously altered so that the face of ███████ ███████ was removed. These objects produced a loud screaming sound when exposed to daylight, and all writing implements within the stall formed symbols associated with the Cult of the Demon ██████ when an attempt to write with them was made. 8 days after the event, all altered stock vanished from Foundation storage.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** ███████, Nova Scotia.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** All altered stock seized and impounded, amnestics administered.

**Event Description:** During an automobile accident, the body of ████ ██, a passenger in one involved vehicle, expanded to fill the entire interior of the vehicle.  Because Mr. ██'s expanded body had taken on a consistency similar to stiff foam rubber, the other occupants of the vehicle were protected from the impact, and were the only survivors of the crash.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** ██████, Connecticut
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Body confiscated, all other occupants and responding personnel administered Class A amnestics.  Tissue tests indicate that Mr. ██ is still alive, though the tissues of his body have become an undifferentiated mass, and tests of neurological function are inconclusive.

**Event Description:** 17-year-old █████ ████████ dies while recording video blog after large, wide-mouthed creature appears from closet and devours her arms. Creature promptly disappears at estimated time of death. Video recovered by local law enforcement, embedded agent intercepts.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** ███████, Michigan.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Footage intercepted; all knowledgeable parties given Class-B amnestics. Cover story involving local psychotic planted. No physical evidence relating to entity found in house. No similar entities have been encountered since. Area is to be kept under surveillance until ██/██/2013.

**Event Description:** Unidentified and unaccompanied child (estimated age: 7 years old) in hospital waiting room produces more than 400 kilograms of vomit in 5 minutes, before dying; other patients describe hearing sounds of "glass breaking" during the emesis.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** ███████ Public Hospital,  ████████████, Madagascar
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Majority of vomit had been incinerated before Foundation agents arrived on-site; inspection of hospital incinerator revealed no anomalies. All remaining samples of vomit were confiscated; analysis revealed no anomalies, except that child had been suffering from salmonella poisoning. Witnesses were given amnestics. Child was never identified; body was removed from hospital morgue and is currently maintained in a Site-19 low-value storage freezer.

**Event Description:** An email is sent to, as near as the Foundation can determine, every active email address in existence, including Foundation intranet-only addresses. The contents are identical across all emails and consist of the following message, in Spanish: "Hi, this is Jorge. It has been fun playing with you, but I am going to visit friends next door now. I will be back later to collect my toys. Take care of the place!" Backtracing reveals that all emails originated from the same unassigned IP address.
**Date of Occurrence:** 12/21/████
**Location:** N/A
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Foundation agents edited the internet-rumor-debunking site ██████.com to include a statement that the email was a massive hoax. The Foundation has periodically mass-emailed similar messages to more limited audiences as a smokescreen. The originating IP address is being monitored for any further activity.

**Event Description:** A man, believed to be ████████ ██████, a suspected associate of the group known as Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd., entered an abandoned factory at ███ ██████ in the Brazilian city of Salvador. Mr. ██████ was being tracked by two Foundation operatives who followed him into the building. A sound of bubbling water followed by gunshots was heard from within the building, and upon entry the operatives found Mr. ██████'s body in a state of advanced decomposition associated with at least three weeks of exposure to the elements, despite only five minutes elapsing between him entering the building and the discovery of the body. A pistol, which had been fired three times, was found in his hand. No sign of his target or possible attacker was found.
**Date of Occurence:** ██/15/████
**Location:** ███ ██████, Salvador, State of Bahia, Brazil.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Information suppressed in local media. Body removed from site by Foundation operatives disguised as Brazilian Federal Police and interred at morgue at Site-██.

**Event Description:** Six sperm whale carcasses were found beached along a 2km stretch of coastline at ████████, New Zealand. When autopsy was performed as part of a civilian research program, it was discovered that the chest cavity of all six whales had been hollowed out postmortem without any damage being done to the exterior of the animals. Exploration of the chest cavity revealed the chest cavity of each whale had somehow been stuffed with what appears to be machinery components trapped in clear plastic.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/18/████
**Location:** ████████, New Zealand.
**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Area sealed. All members of the research team detained and administered Class-A Amnestics. False story disseminated claiming that the decomposition of the whales' bodies had led to the build-up of toxic gas inside the carcasses, leading to government intervention on grounds of public health. Masses found inside body cavities removed and shipped to Storage Site-██. Remains incinerated in the field and disposed of through normal channels.

**Event Description:** Two male cadavers were found outside of █████ █████ Park, Alabama. Each wore lead masks and and a series of black rashes were visible on the skin of the faces. Locals in the area during the actual event reported that the two men "hovered in the air" for an estimation of 5 minutes before dropping dead. After the bodies were taken to ████ Hospital for autopsy, both the men were seen at the park. They promptly killed any living being within the area, even taking the time to crush insects. Overall, there were █ civilian casualties. When the men were subdued by Operatives from Task Force-██, their bodily organs were found to be completely missing, despite being able to move freely. After the events, the hospital reported that the bodies were missing.
**Date of Occurrence:**  ██/5/████
**Location:** █████ █████ Park
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Class A amnestics distributed to civilian witness, including the hospital staff involved. Bodies of the two subjects restrained and sent for further research at Site ██.

**Location:** Various hospitals throughout New Jersey
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Class-A amnestics administered to radiography technicians.

**Event Description:** Viewers of the popular late-night talk show ████ █████ ██ ███ █████ reported seeing two different episodes. Approximately 40% watched an episode featuring the famous actor █████ ███ and the musical guest ██ ██████ , while the other 60% watched an episode with ██ ██████  with appearance by stand-up comedian ████ ██. Neither one of these episodes was the one which had actually broadcast, and neither one has ever been filmed.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** TV sets throughout the US that were tuned on ███
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** All recordings of the anomalous episodes showed the actual broadcast episode in later viewings. Viewer's memories of the anomalous episodes seem to have completely faded by themselves by ██/██/████. ███ channel officials who had been contacted about the episodes were administered Class C amnestics and their internal investigation into the matter aborted. Social networks mentioning the matter were intercepted and edited.

**Event Description:** The Cincinnati metropolitan area and all objects and lifeforms in it became greyscale for approximately 77 hours, starting at approximately 10:00 AM. All humans in the metropolitan area when the change occurred were not aware of the existence of color while the effect persisted. Those who entered the area of effect after the change occurred were not affected, but affected individuals treated them with fear and suspicion. When the change was reverted through unknown means, all individuals within the affected area lost their memories of the event, although those who had left the area of effect before the restoration of color retained their memories.
**Date of Occurrence:** 3/21/2014 through 3/23/2014
**Location:** Cincinnati, Ohio, USA 
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Class A amnestics administered to individuals who retained memories of the event, and all records of the event destroyed.

**Date of Occurence:** 2014/██/██
**Location:** Birmingham, England, UK
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Class-B amnestics were administered to all witnesses. All weights were taken in custody for further studying. Following the event, the objects displayed no apparent anomalous effect. However, closer inspections revealed that the words "Brought to you by the Kobayashi Athletics" were inscribed on the items. All weights were replaced by new ones. The establishment is to be kept under surveillance until 2016/██/██.

Pending further additions.
