title:Log of Extranormal Events
**Foreword:** This page is to document anomalous events that have attracted the Foundation's interests, but occurred too briefly for the Foundation to secure or contain them. Instead, the Foundation deploys a cover-up team to conceal the evidence from the public. This is merely a reminder to agents and researchers that not all of them can be contained.
-Agent Carriontrooper

**Event Description:** Footage from surveying vessel "Calypso" recorded several bright flashes on ocean bottom, similar in intensity and duration to hand grenades being fired.

**Location:** █████████, Nevada, USA
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Data suppressed, area to be monitored for future natural population spikes .

**Event Description:** Time skips between 2.5 and ██ hours take place in ████████████, North Carolina before normalizing to one day after initial skip. Non self-correcting electronic devices such as digital clocks are seemingly unaffected and display incorrect times at different areas of the town. Event bears similarity to a relatively unnoticed event in ███ █████, Nevada though no connection can be traced between the two events.
**Date of Occurrence:** █/██/████
**Location:** ████████████, North Carolina (███ █████, Nevada)
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Local news reports electromagnetic interference caused by local power plant. Small observation team assigned to area.

**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** ████████.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Population dosed with Class B Amnesiacs and a cover story was established.  A road accident with a Samson-Craig Products (an SCP front company) chemical tanker was staged, an emergency evacuation camp was arranged and the population given £███ per head compensation.  In the ██ years since there event there has been no recurrence or abnormal behaviour in the population.

**Event Description:** Three similar looking men were witnessed fighting in a gas station parking lot. Eyewitness reports maintain that each man claimed to be ██████ █████████, a well known local car salesman, and were fighting over which individual was the "true" one. Two of the men were killed when the third procured a crowbar. The third was fatally shot by a local police officer.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** █████, Oklahoma
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Witnesses and involved persons were questioned and given Class B Amnesiacs. Close family members of ██████ █████████ were questioned and given Class A Amnesiacs.

**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** ██████, Puerto Rico
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Witnesses were issued Class B Amnesiacs. All recording devices were confiscated. Relevant photographs are available in the Foundation Archives. An operative was assigned to sweep five square kilometers around the original site of contact for two weeks. No further information was recovered.  

**Event Description:** An employee from the [REDACTED] toy store was found dead in the back room covered by action figures. Security camera footage showed the figures becoming animated and attacking the employee. The figures did not animate when anyone else entered the storeroom.

**Location:** ████████, █████.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** The security footage was confiscated and replaced with false tapes displaying the employee committing suicide and knocking over a stack of boxes containing action figures. Witnesses of the actual body were administered a Class B amnesiac. The toy store, its employees and the surrounding area was put under surveillance for three (3) weeks, and was marked as a POI in Foundation documents on █████. The brand of action figures and the factory that produced the relevant batch were investigated by covert agents. Nothing of interest was found. 

**Event Description:** Static on channel 682 broadcast by the ████ Satellite company spontaneously took the form of 27 concentric black and white circles for 18 seconds.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** All TV sets served by ████ in the USA.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** The only footage of the event recorded was taken by The Foundation as part of The Foundation's investigations into SCP-███.  Because Channel 682 did not have content at the time of the event, it is estimated that fewer than ███ people witnessed the event.  As such, knowledge of the event has been allowed to persist as an urban myth.  SCP-███'s monitoring will also detect any recurrences, although none have appeared.

**Event Description:** Several students attending █████████ Collegiate began complaining about a loud buzzing noise. A custodian for the school located the source as a single monitor in the computer lab during his duties, and reported the power button was unresponsive. When the lab technicians arrived the next day, they unplugged the monitor after other attempts proved futile. Witnesses of the event report a scream playing through the computer's speakers, and the image of a digitized face screaming appeared for a moment before power was lost.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** █████████ Collegiate in the ██████, ████████, USA.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** The monitor was confiscated and replaced for inspection. Nothing of interest has been found.

**Event Description:** A mission not typically present was located in the MMORPG █████ ██ ████████.  The mission was only accessible via a bugged area of terrain but had existed for an unknown period of time.  The mission was an exact replica of Site-██ with several hostile SCPs (not necessarily those housed there) as opponents.  No code for the mission was found on the game's server by Foundation Investigation teams.
**Date of Occurrence:** Unknown.  Detected ██/██/████
**Location:** Geographical location unclear.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** A viral attack on the server was made, resulting in a total shut down.  After the server was re-initialised the mission was absent.  All individuals known to have found the mission have been given Class A Amnesiacs.  There has been no recurrence to date.

**Event Description:** The entire stock of ███████ ███████ souvenirs at the ███████ ███████ stall on the waterfront were altered so that the face of ███████ ███████ was removed and the objects screamed when exposed to daylight and all writing implements formed symbols associated with the Cult of the Demon ██████ when an attempt to write with them was made.  8 days after the event, all altered stock vanished from Foundation storage.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** ███████, Nova Scotia.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** All altered stock seized and impounded and amnesiacs where administered.


**Event Description:** ██████ ████ Church members all simultaneously experienced what they later described as "grace," in which each was given a vision of the return of Christ.  Simultaneously, local community members not attending saw a bright flash of light emanating from the windows and doors of the building.

**Event Description:** During an automobile accident, the body of ████ ██, a passenger in one involved vehicle, expanded to fill the entire interior of the vehicle.  Because Mr. ██'s expanded body had taken on a consistency similar to stiff foam rubber, the other occupants of the vehicle were protected from the impact, and were the only survivors of the crash.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** ██████, Connecticut
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Body confiscated, all other occupants and responding personnel administered Class A amnesiacs.  Tissue tests indicate that Mr. ██ is still alive, though the tissues of his body have become an undifferentiated mass, and tests of neurological function are inconclusive.

**Event Description:** 17-year-old █████ ████████ dies while recording video blog after large, wide-mouthed creature appears from closet and devours her arms. Creature promptly disappears at estimated time of death. Video recovered by local law enforcement, embedded agent intercepts.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** ███████, Michigan.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Footage intercepted; all knowledgeable parties given Class-B amnesiacs. Cover story involving local psychotic planted. No physical evidence relating to entity found in house. No similar entities have been encountered since. Area to be kept under surveillance until ██/██/2013.

**Event Description:** Crew on █████-██████ oil rig (PCO-██) reported a 'tentacle' of water rising from the ocean and striking the rig. 'Tentacle' lost form upon impact, and no damage was done. Some personnel report a screeching sound "like car brakes on hot cement".
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** Pacific Ocean, coordinates [REDACTED].
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Only one recording of the incident was made on crewman B████ A█████'s mobile phone, which was soon confiscated for further investigation. A team of divers was sent to the area for investigation, but nothing abnormal was recorded apart from an unusually high level of magnesium in the water.

**Event Description:** Unidentified and unaccompanied child (estimated age: 7 years old) in hospital waiting room produces more than 400 kilograms of vomit in 5 minutes, before dying; other patients describe hearing sounds of "glass breaking" during the emesis.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** ███████ Public Hospital,  ████████████, Madagascar
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Majority of vomit had been incinerated before Foundation agents arrived on-site; inspection of hospital incinerator revealed no anomalies. All remaining samples of vomit were confiscated; analysis revealed no anomalies, except that child had been suffering from salmonella poisoning. Witnesses were given amnesiacs. Child was never identified; body was removed from hospital morgue and is currently maintained in a Site-19 minimum security storage freezer.

**Event Description:** A cylinder of land, measuring 30m in diameter and 5m below ground, centered on a farmhouse, is instantly rotated 16.92 degrees counterclockwise. This rotation severs all water, sewage, electric and telephone connections. Single inhabitant at time of occurence reports event and a momentary feeling of disorientation on a personal blog.
