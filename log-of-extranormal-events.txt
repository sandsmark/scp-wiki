title:Log of Extranormal Events
**Forward:** This page is to document anomalous events that have attracted the Foundation's interests, but occured too briefly for the Foundation to secure or contain it. Instead, the Foundation deploys a cover-up team to conceal the evidence from the public. This is merely a reminder to agents and researchers that not all of them can be contained.
