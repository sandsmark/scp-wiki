**Foreword:** This page is to document anomalous events that have attracted the Foundation's interests, but occurred too briefly for the Foundation to secure or contain them. Instead, the Foundation deploys a cover-up team to conceal the evidence from the public. This is merely a reminder to agents and researchers that not all of them can be contained.
-Agent Carriontrooper

**Event Description:** Footage from surveying vessel "Calypso" recorded several bright flashes on ocean bottom, similar in intensity and duration to hand grenades being fired.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** ██.██ East, ██.██ North, Sub-Littoral zone of Atlantic Ocean.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Footage deleted, camera error blamed.

**Event Description:** 3 civilians reported a glowing figure appearing in the center of a nearby lake, two cell-phone images supporting. There is no reason to believe the anomaly lasted longer then several seconds before abruptly disappearing.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** ██████ Lake Camp Grounds, ████████, USA
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Local media sources monitored, rumors involving the existence of a "lake ghost" disseminated. Special attention to be paid to the region in the future.

**Event Description:** A naked, glowing humanoid figure appeared suddenly in the city's subway and seen by several eyewitnesses and captured by the security cameras. It disappeared after a few seconds.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** ███████, Spain
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** A team of disguised agents and a makeshift holographic projection unit were taken on location. Team explained that the incident was a part of their avant-garde 'urban shock art' exhibition all over Europe. Fake viral media planted to give credence to the team's supposed art group.

**Event Description:** Spider population of █████████, a small town, quintupled over the space of three months. Not known to correspond to any significant SCP item activity.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** █████████, Nevada, USA
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Data suppressed, area to be monitored for future natural population spikes .

**Event Description:** Time skips between 2.5 and ██ hours take place in ████████████, North Carolina before normalizing to one day after initial skip. Non self-correcting electronic devices such as digital clocks are seemingly unaffected and display incorrect times at different areas of the town. Event bears similarity to a relatively unnoticed event in ███ █████, Nevada though no connection can be traced between the two events.
**Date of Occurrence:** █/██/████
**Location:** ████████████, North Carolina (███ █████, Nevada)
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Local news reports electromagnetic interference caused by local power plant. Small observation team assigned to area.

**Event Description:** ████████, Wales, was found to be abandoned.  The population was found comatose in a nearby field.  ██ hours after the estimated time of the event the population awoke with no recollection of the event.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** ████████.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Population dosed with Class B Amnesiacs and a cover story was established.  A road accident with a Samson-Craig Products (an SCP front company) chemical tanker was staged, an emergency evacuation camp was arranged and the population given £███ per head compensation.  In the ██ years since there event there has been no recurrence or abnormal behaviour in the population.

**Event Description:** Three similar looking men were witnessed fighting in a gas station parking lot. Eyewitness reports maintain that each man claimed to be ██████ █████████, a well known local car salesman, and were fighting over which individual was the "true" one. Two of the men were killed when the third procured a crowbar. The third was fatally shot by a local police officer.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** █████, Oklahoma
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Witnesses and involved persons were questioned and given Class B Amnesiacs. Close family members of ██████ █████████ were questioned and given Class A Amnesiacs. A cover story involving the individual's suicide was established. The three bodies were recovered for autopsy and are currently maintained in a Site-19 minimum security storage freezer.  

**Event Description:** An American tour group reported catching brief glimpses of a Hispaniolan Amazon (//Amazona ventralis//) with compound eyes and irregular horizontal mandibles while on a jungle hike.  
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** ██████, Puerto Rico
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Witnesses were issued Class B Amnesiacs. All recording devices were confiscated. Relevant photographs are available in the Foundation Archives. An operative was assigned to sweep five square kilometers around the original site of contact for two weeks. No further information was recovered.  

**Event Description:** An employee from the [REDACTED] toy store was found dead in the back room covered by action figures. Security camera footage showed the figures becoming animated and attacking the employee. The figures did not animate when anyone else entered the storeroom.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** ████████, █████.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** The security footage was confiscated and replaced with false tapes displaying the employee committing suicide and knocking over a stack of boxes containing action figures. Witnesses of the actual body were administered a Class B amnesiac. The toy store, its employees and the surrounding area was put under surveillance for three (3) weeks, and was marked as a POI in Foundation documents on █████. The brand of action figures and the factory that produced the relevant batch were investigated by covert agents. Nothing of interest was found. 

**Event Description:** Static on channel 682 broadcast by the ████ Satellite company spontaneously took the form of 27 concentric black and white circles for 18 seconds.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** All TV sets served by ████ in the USA.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** The only footage of the event recorded was taken by The Foundation as part of The Foundation's investigations into SCP-███.  Because Channel 682 did not have content at the time of the event, it is estimated that fewer than ███ people witnessed the event.  As such, knowledge of the event has been allowed to persist as an urban myth.  SCP-███'s monitoring will also detect any recurrences, although none have appeared.

**Event Description:** Several students attending █████████ Collegiate began complaining about a loud buzzing noise. A custodian for the school located the source as a single monitor in the computer lab during his duties, and reported the power button was unresponsive. When the lab technicians arrived the next day, they unplugged the monitor after other attempts proved futile. Witnesses of the event report a scream playing through the computer's speakers, and the image of a digitized face screaming appeared for a moment before power was lost.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** █████████ Collegiate in the ██████, ████████, USA.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** The monitor was confiscated and replaced for inspection. Nothing of interest has been found.

**Event Description:** A mission not typically present was located in the MMORPG █████ ██ ████████.  The mission was only accessible via a bugged area of terrain but had existed for an unknown period of time.  The mission was an exact replica of Site-██ with several hostile SCPs (not necessarily those housed there) as opponents.  No code for the mission was found on the game's server by Foundation Investigation teams.
**Date of Occurrence:** Unknown.  Detected ██/██/████
**Location:** Geographical location unclear.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** A viral attack on the server was made, resulting in a total shut down.  After the server was re-initialised the mission was absent.  All individuals known to have found the mission have been given Class A Amnesiacs.  There has been no recurrence to date.

**Event Description:** The entire stock of ███████ ███████ souvenirs at the ███████ ███████ stall on the waterfront were altered so that the face of ███████ ███████ was removed and the objects screamed when exposed to daylight and all writing implements formed symbols associated with the Cult of the Demon ██████ when an attempt to write with them was made.  8 days after the event, all altered stock vanished from Foundation storage.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** ███████, Nova Scotia.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** All altered stock seized and impounded and amnesiacs where administered.


**Event Description:** ██████ ████ Church members all simultaneously experienced what they later described as "grace," in which each was given a vision of the return of Christ.  Simultaneously, local community members not attending saw a bright flash of light emanating from the windows and doors of the building.  
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** ████████, West Virginia.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Flash explained as a power surge; church members currently under further investigation. 


**Event Description:** Foundation telescopes observe asteroid 330 Adalberta accelerate at a rate varying between ██ and ███ m/s^^2^^ for a period of five days. 
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████ to ██/██/████ 
**Location:** Main belt.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Initial discovery of asteroid explained as erroneous, object now under periodic surveillance.  Current orbit determined to pose no threat of impact with Earth.


**Event Description:** During an automobile accident, the body of ████ ██, a passenger in one involved vehicle, expanded to fill the entire interior of the vehicle.  Because Mr. ██'s expanded body had taken on a consistency similar to stiff foam rubber, the other occupants of the vehicle were protected from the impact, and were the only survivors of the crash.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** ██████, Connecticut
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Body confiscated, all other occupants and responding personnel administered Class A amnesiacs.  Tissue tests indicate that Mr. ██ is still alive, though the tissues of his body have become an undifferentiated mass, and tests of neurological function are inconclusive.

**Event Description:** 17-year-old █████ ████████ dies while recording video blog after large, wide-mouthed creature appears from closet and devours her arms. Creature promptly disappears at estimated time of death. Video recovered by local law enforcement, embedded agent intercepts.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** ███████, Michigan.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Footage intercepted; all knowledgeable parties given Class-B amnesiacs. Cover story involving local psychotic planted. No physical evidence relating to entity found in house. No similar entities have been encountered since. Area to be kept under surveillance until ██/██/2013.

**Event Description:** Crew on █████-██████ oil rig (PCO-██) reported a 'tentacle' of water rising from the ocean and striking the rig. 'Tentacle' lost form upon impact, and no damage was done. Some personnel report a screeching sound "like car brakes on hot cement".
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** Pacific Ocean, coordinates [REDACTED].
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Only one recording of the incident was made on crewman B████ A█████'s mobile phone, which was soon confiscated for further investigation. A team of divers was sent to the area for investigation, but nothing abnormal was recorded apart from an unusually high level of magnesium in the water.

**Event Description:** Unidentified and unaccompanied child (estimated age: 7 years old) in hospital waiting room produces more than 400 kilograms of vomit in 5 minutes, before dying; other patients describe hearing sounds of "glass breaking" during the emesis.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** ███████ Public Hospital,  ████████████, Madagascar
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Majority of vomit had been incinerated before Foundation agents arrived on-site; inspection of hospital incinerator revealed no anomalies. All remaining samples of vomit were confiscated; analysis revealed no anomalies, except that child had been suffering from salmonella poisoning. Witnesses were given amnesiacs. Child was never identified; body was removed from hospital morgue and is currently maintained in a Site-19 minimum security storage freezer.

**Event Description:** A cylinder of land, measuring 30m in diameter and 5m below ground, centered on a farmhouse, is instantly rotated 16.92 degrees counterclockwise. This rotation severs all water, sewage, electric and telephone connections. Single inhabitant at time of occurence reports event and a momentary feeling of disorientation on a personal blog.
**Date of Occurence:** ██/██/201█
**Location:** ████, ██, USA
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Property is condemned through regular channels and acquired by the Foundation within 7 days. The owner of the property and all occupants are given class B amnesiacs and re-located. Standard information countermeasures are employed to discredit event as urban legend. Subsequent analysis of property and underlying land reveals no detectable spatial or extradimensional anomalies.

**Event Description:** Red-coloured rain fell on some portions of the Indian state of Kerala, causing much panic and media attention. Instances of black, yellow and brown rain were also reported over the next 9 months.
**Date of Occurrence:**█/██/19██ to ██/█/19██
**Location:**Kerala, India
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Procedure C-39 "Houdini" was initiated, whereupon all samples of the rain collected for analysis were replaced with identical-looking solution containing red algae spores and the anomaly blamed on a local algae bloom coupled with strong winds. Analysed samples of red rain were found to contain ordinary red dye. Subsequent yellow, brown and black rains were dealt with in a similar fashion, and samples were merely found to contain ordinary coloured dye.

**Event Description:** Loud screaming sounds were heard emanating from all rooms of ██████ ██████ Elementary School for three consecutive hours. The screams were ascribed to no less than six distinct voices. No source for the screaming was found.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** ████████, ███████
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Amnesiacs were administered to all faculty and students. Standard disinformation countermeasures were employed.

**Event Description:** An email is sent to, as near as the Foundation can determine, every active email address in existence, including Foundation intranet-only addresses. The contents are identical across all emails and consist of the following message, in Spanish: "Hi, this is Jorge. It has been fun playing with you, but I am going to visit friends next door now. I will be back later to collect my toys. Take care of the place!" Backtracing reveals that all emails originated from the same unassigned IP address.
**Date of Occurrence:** 12/21/████
**Location:** N/A
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Foundation agents editted the internet-rumor-debunking site ██████.com to include a statement that the email was a massive hoax. The Foundation has periodically mass-emailed similar messages to more limited audiences as a smokescreen. The originating IP address is being monitored for any further activity.

**Event Description:** A weather report via ███ █ News showing a 5-day forecast shows in the background a cloud formation resembling SCP-████.
**Date of Occurrence:** 11/11/████
**Location:** ██ ███████, ██
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Amnesiacs administered to anchors and cameramen, as well as all members in the area who saw said broadcast. Mobile Task Force Nu-6 posted false posts on █-████'s subforum /█/ posing as a group of hackers claiming responsibility. Area monitored for future reoccurrences.

**Event Description:** A large portion of rock on the east rim of the ██████ █████ waterfall abruptly eroded, altering the shape of the cascade. As a result, all views of the waterfall adopted a slight memetic property. Anyone seeing the landscape began to perceive the "click" noise heard on swallowing as a voice saying the word "coke." Photographs and video recordings made at this time had the same effect.
**Date of Occurrence:** 08/24/████
**Location:** ██████ █████, ███████
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** The event lasted for roughly thirty minutes and affected an estimated ███ people. Foundation agents were beginning to secure the area when another section of the waterfall underwent a similar change, nullifying the memetic effect. Affected patrons were [DATA EXPUNGED] according to standard meme scrubbing protocols. Cover story placed and all photos and videos confiscated. Region to be given special attention in future.

**Event Description:** All water supplies within the ██████████ Building, Leicester produced a viscous blue liquid that witnesses reported to taste of [REDACTED], subjects who imbibed the liquid were [DATA EXPUNGED], resulting in █ casualties.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/12/████
**Location:** ██████████ Building, Leicester, United Kingdom
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Class-A amnesiac administered to all witnesses, agents currently investigating the local pumping station.

**Event Description:** A man, believed to be ████████ ██████, a suspected associate of the group known as Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd., entered an abandoned factory at ███ ██████ in the Brazilian city of Salvador. Mr. ██████ was being tracked by two Foundation operatives who followed him into the building. A sound of bubbling water followed by gunshots was heard from within the building, and upon entry the operatives found Mr. ██████'s body in a state of advanced decomposition associated with at least three weeks of exposure to the elements, despite only five minutes elapsing between him entering the building and the discovery of the body. A pistol, which had been fired three times, was found in his hand. No sign of his target or possible attacker was found.
**Date of Occurence:** ██/15/████
**Location:** ███ ██████, Salvador, State of Bahia, Brazil.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Information suppressed in local media. Body removed from site by Foundation operatives disguised as Brazilian Federal Police and interred at morgue at Site-██.

**Event Description:** Six sperm whale carcasses were found beached along a 2km stretch of coastline at ████████, New Zealand. When autopsy was performed as part of a civilian research program, it was discovered that the chest cavity of all six whales had been hollowed out postmortem without any damage being done to the the exterior of the animals. Exploration of the chest cavity revealed the chest cavity of each whale had somehow been stuffed with what appears to be machinery components trapped in clear plastic.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/18/████
**Location:** ████████, New Zealand.
**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Area sealed. All members of the research team detained and administered Class-A Amnesiacs. False story disseminated claiming that the decomposition of the whales' bodies had led to the build-up of toxic gas inside the carcasses, leading to government intervention on grounds of public health. Masses found inside body cavities removed and shipped to Storage Site-██. Remains incinerated in the field and disposed of through normal channels.

**Event Description:** Between three and four men wearing black clothes and masks broke into ██████ ████ Art Museum, which was at the time hosting an exhibition of the work of local artist ██████ ████. The men evaded security and stole three paintings from this exhibit. Two security cameras capture the men entering the building by way of a cylindrical tunnel which opened in a wall to allow them passage, and which closed as they left, apparently created by a device operated by one of the criminals. No trace of the tunnel or any meaningful forensic evidence was found at the scene.
**Date of Occurence:** ██/20/████
**Location:** ██████ ████ Art Museum, ███████.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Footage destroyed by Foundation operatives embedded in ███████ Police Department, who at the present time have closed the case. Investigation into the criminals and the device used in the robbery were briefly attempted, but nothing of consequence was found.

**Event Description:** Two male cadavers were found outside of █████ █████ Park, Alabama. Each wore lead masks and and a series of black rashes were visible on the skin of the faces. Locals in the area during the actual event reported that the two men "hovered in the air" for an estimation of 5 minutes before dropping dead. After the bodies were taken to ████ Hospital for autopsy, both the men were seen at the park. They promptly killed any living being within the area, even taking the time to crush insects. Overall, there were █ civilian casualties. When the men were subdued by Operatives from Task Force-██, their bodily organs were found to be completely missing, despite being able to move freely. After the events, the hospital reported that the bodies were missing.
**Date if Occurence:**  ██/5/████
**Location:** █████ █████ Park
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Class A amnesiacs distributed to civilian witness,including the hospital staff involved. Bodies of the two subjects restrained and sent for further research at Site ██.

**Event Description:** The ██████ ██████ flight between Heathrow, London and Hartsfield-Jackson, Atlanta suffered a malfunction and crashed into the Atlantic Ocean, 800 km from the Azores archipelago. Despite this, all passengers and crew walked out the destination gate, remembering only a regular flight.
**Date of Occurence:** ██/11/████
**Location:** North Atlantic Ocean
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Information suppressed and mass amnesiac treatment performed, recovery of aircraft underway.

**Event Description:** The north exterior wall of the ████████ Bank in █████, Ukraine burst outward. Debris were found to have landed in such a way as to spell "ĈU NI MOJOSA ANKORAŬ". Three days later, SCP-███ produced a short message reading "It wasn't us. --Two Eye Oracle".
**Date of Occurrence:** 27/02/19██
**Location:** █████, Ukraine
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Witnesses given amnesiacs. Police documentation seized.

Pending further additions.
