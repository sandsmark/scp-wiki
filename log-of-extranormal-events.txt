**Foreword:** This page is to document anomalous events that have attracted the Foundation's interests, but occurred too briefly for the Foundation to secure or contain them. Instead, the Foundation deploys a cover-up team to conceal the evidence from the public. This is merely a reminder to agents and researchers that not all of them can be contained.
-Agent Carriontrooper

**Event Description:** 3 civilians reported a glowing figure appearing in the center of a nearby lake, two cell-phone images supporting. There is no reason to believe the anomaly lasted longer than several seconds before abruptly disappearing.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** ██████ Lake Camp Grounds, ████████, USA.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Local media sources monitored, rumors involving the existence of a "lake ghost" disseminated. Special attention is to be paid to the region in the future.

**Event Description:** A naked, glowing humanoid figure appeared suddenly in the city's subway and seen by several eyewitnesses and captured by the security cameras. It disappeared after a few seconds.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** ███████, Spain.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** A team of disguised agents and a makeshift holographic projection unit were taken on location. Team explained that the incident was a part of their avant-garde 'urban shock art' exhibition all over Europe. Fake viral media planted to give credence to the team's supposed art group.

**Event Description:** Spider population of █████████, a small town, quintupled over the space of three months. Not known to correspond to any significant SCP item activity.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** █████████, Nevada, USA.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Data suppressed, area to be monitored for future natural population spikes.

**Event Description:** Time skips between 2.5 and ██ hours took place in ████████████, North Carolina before normalizing to one day after initial skip. Non self-correcting electronic devices such as digital clocks were seemingly unaffected and displayed incorrect times in different areas of the town. Event bears similarity to a relatively unnoticed event in ███ █████, Nevada, though no connection could be traced between the two events.
**Date of Occurrence:** █/██/████
**Location:** ████████████, North Carolina (███ █████, Nevada).
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Local news reported electromagnetic interference caused by local power plant. Small observation team assigned to area.

**Event Description:** ████████, Wales, was found to be abandoned. The population was found comatose in a nearby field. ██ hours after the estimated time of the event, the population awoke with no recollection of the event.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** ████████.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Population dosed with Class B Amnestics and a cover story was established. A road accident with a Samson-Craig Products (an SCP front company) chemical tanker was staged, an emergency evacuation camp was arranged and the population given £███ per head compensation. In the ██ years since the event there has been no recurrence or abnormal behaviour in the population.

**Event Description:** Three similar looking men were witnessed fighting in a gas station parking lot. Eyewitness reports maintain that each man claimed to be ██████ █████████, a well known local car salesman, and were fighting over which individual was the "true" one. Two of the men were killed when the third procured a crowbar. The third was fatally shot by a local police officer.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** █████, Oklahoma.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Witnesses and involved persons were questioned and given Class B Amnestics. Close family members of ██████ █████████ were questioned and given Class A Amnestics. A cover story involving the individual's suicide was established. The three bodies were recovered for autopsy and are currently maintained in a Site-19 minimum security storage freezer.

**Event Description:** Several students attending █████████ Collegiate began complaining about a loud buzzing noise. A custodian for the school located the source as a single monitor in the computer lab during his duties, and reported the power button was unresponsive. When the lab technicians arrived the next day, they unplugged the monitor after other attempts proved futile. Witnesses of the event report a scream playing through the computer's speakers, and the image of a digitized face screaming appeared for a moment before power was lost.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** █████████ Collegiate in the ██████, ████████, USA.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** The monitor was confiscated and replaced for inspection. Nothing of interest has been found.

**Event Description:** A mission not typically present was located in the MMORPG [REDACTED]. The mission was only accessible via a bugged area of terrain but had existed for an unknown period of time. The mission was an exact replica of Site-██ with several hostile SCPs (not necessarily those housed there) as opponents. No code for the mission was found on the game's server by Foundation Investigation teams.
**Date of Occurrence:** Unknown. Detected ██/██/████
**Location:** Geographical location unclear.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** A viral attack on the server was performed, resulting in a total shut down. After the server was re-initialized the mission was absent. All individuals known to have found the mission have been given Class A Amnestics. There has been no recurrence to date.

**Event Description:** The entire stock of ███████ ███████ souvenirs at the ███████ ███████ stall on the ██████ waterfront were spontaneously altered so that the face of ███████ ███████ was removed. These objects produced a loud screaming sound when exposed to daylight, and all writing implements within the stall formed symbols associated with the Cult of the Demon ██████ when an attempt to write with them was made. 8 days after the event, all altered stock vanished from Foundation storage.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** ███████, Nova Scotia.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** All altered stock seized and impounded, amnestics administered.

**Event Description:** During an automobile accident, the body of ████ ██, a passenger in one involved vehicle, expanded to fill the entire interior of the vehicle. Because Mr. ██'s expanded body had taken on a consistency similar to stiff foam rubber, the other occupants of the vehicle were protected from the impact, and were the only survivors of the crash.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** ██████, Connecticut.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Body confiscated, all other occupants and responding personnel administered Class A amnestics. Tissue tests indicate that Mr. ██ is still alive, though the tissues of his body have become an undifferentiated mass, and tests of neurological function are inconclusive.

**Event Description:** 17-year-old █████ ████████ dies while recording video blog after large, wide-mouthed creature appears from closet and devours her arms. Creature promptly disappears at estimated time of death. Video recovered by local law enforcement, embedded agent intercepts.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** ███████, Michigan.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Footage intercepted; all knowledgeable parties given Class-B amnestics. Cover story involving local psychotic planted. No physical evidence relating to entity found in house. No similar entities have been encountered since. Area is to be kept under surveillance until ██/██/2016.

**Event Description:** Unidentified and unaccompanied child (estimated age: 7 years old) in hospital waiting room produces more than 400 kilograms of vomit in 5 minutes, before dying; other patients describe hearing sounds of "glass breaking" during the emesis.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** ███████ Public Hospital, ████████████, Madagascar.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Majority of vomit had been incinerated before Foundation agents arrived on-site; inspection of hospital incinerator revealed no anomalies. All remaining samples of vomit were confiscated; analysis revealed no anomalies, except that child had been suffering from salmonella poisoning. Witnesses were given amnestics. Child was never identified; body was removed from hospital morgue and is currently maintained in a Site-19 low-value storage freezer.

**Event Description:** An email is sent to, as near as the Foundation can determine, every active email address in existence, including Foundation intranet-only addresses. The contents are identical across all emails and consist of the following message, in Spanish: "Hi, this is Jorge. It has been fun playing with you, but I am going to visit friends next door now. I will be back later to collect my toys. Take care of the place!" Backtracing reveals that all emails originated from the same unassigned IP address.
**Date of Occurrence:** 12/21/████
**Location:** N/A
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Foundation agents edited the internet-rumor-debunking site ██████.com to include a statement that the email was a massive hoax. The Foundation has periodically mass-emailed similar messages to more limited audiences as a smokescreen. The originating IP address is being monitored for any further activity.

**Event Description:** A man, believed to be ████████ ██████, a suspected associate of the group known as Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd., entered an abandoned factory at ███ ██████ in the Brazilian city of Salvador. Mr. ██████ was being tracked by two Foundation operatives who followed him into the building. A sound of bubbling water followed by gunshots was heard from within the building, and upon entry the operatives found Mr. ██████'s body in a state of advanced decomposition associated with at least three weeks of exposure to the elements, despite only five minutes elapsing between him entering the building and the discovery of the body. A pistol, which had been fired three times, was found in his hand. No sign of his target or possible attacker was found.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/15/████
**Location:** ███ ██████, Salvador, State of Bahia, Brazil.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Information suppressed in local media. Body removed from site by Foundation operatives disguised as Brazilian Federal Police and interred at morgue at Site-██.

**Event Description:** Six sperm whale carcasses were found beached along a 2km stretch of coastline at ████████, New Zealand. When autopsy was performed as part of a civilian research program, it was discovered that the chest cavity of all six whales had been hollowed out postmortem without any damage being done to the exterior of the animals. Exploration of the chest cavity revealed the chest cavity of each whale had somehow been stuffed with what appears to be machinery components trapped in clear plastic.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/18/████
**Location:** ████████, New Zealand.
**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Area sealed. All members of the research team detained and administered Class-A Amnestics. False story disseminated claiming that the decomposition of the whales' bodies had led to the build-up of toxic gas inside the carcasses, leading to government intervention on grounds of public health. Masses found inside body cavities removed and shipped to Storage Site-██. Remains incinerated in the field and disposed of through normal channels.

**Event Description:** Two male cadavers were found outside of █████ █████ Park, Alabama. Each wore lead masks and a series of black rashes were visible on the skin of the faces. Locals in the area during the actual event reported that the two men "hovered in the air" for an estimation of 5 minutes before dropping dead. After the bodies were taken to ████ Hospital for autopsy, both the men were seen at the park. They promptly killed any living being within the area, even taking the time to crush insects. Overall, there were █ civilian casualties. When the men were subdued by Operatives from Task Force-██, their bodily organs were found to be completely missing, despite being able to move freely. After the events, the hospital reported that the bodies were missing.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/05/████
**Location:** █████ █████ Park.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Class A amnestics distributed to civilian witness, including the hospital staff involved. Bodies of the two subjects restrained and sent for further research at Site ██.

**Event Description:** The ██████ ██████ flight between Heathrow, London and Hartsfield-Jackson, Atlanta suffered a malfunction and crashed into the Atlantic Ocean, 800 km from the Azores archipelago. Despite this, all passengers and crew walked out the destination gate, remembering only a regular flight.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/11/████
**Location:** North Atlantic Ocean.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Information suppressed and mass amnestic treatment performed, recovery of aircraft underway.

**Event Description:** Every domesticated cat inside the city limits of ██████, Norway travelled 10.9 km SE to ██████████████, Sweden over period of 8 hours. Cats congregated in groupings of 13-25 in a field behind [DATA EXPUNGED] for 2 hours, then dispersed.
**Date of Occurrence:** 25/09/2009
**Location:** Norway/Sweden border.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Cats returned of own accord to their homes. Any footage of gathering confiscated for study. Witnesses processed, debriefed, and administered Class B Amnestic. Field searched for abnormalities, blood and urine samples taken from cats in affected areas. No anomalies found. Both ██████ and the field will be under surveillance until 30/09/2014.

**Event Description:** Automated systems worldwide behaved as though an extra day occurred at the end of July. Analysis of planetary motion and stellar alignment confirm presence of 367 days in the year.
**Date of Occurrence:** 32/7/1996
**Location:** Global.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Hard data revealing date confiscated and destroyed. Most individuals have naturally put the event out of their minds. Foundation-sponsored disinformation campaigns persist.

**Event Description:** During a speech to a public committee, the mayor of ████████, FL began continuously chuckling at a pun made by an legislative observer for approximately 4.5 hours straight before collapsing into a nearby chair and passing out. He claims to have no memory of the event, nor did anyone else in the room during the speech. The only available evidence of its occurrence was captured entirely on camera.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/19██
**Location:** ████████, Florida.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Any and all witnesses who videotaped the event, along with anyone who viewed the videotapes themselves were given Class B Amnestics, and all resulting videotapes were wiped clean. The mayor himself is under minor surveillance from select members of the Foundation.

**Event Description:** ██ books in the ███████ library spontaneously ignited. Witnesses reported that the fires unexpectedly did not spread to adjacent books. The fires burned for ██ minutes until the books were completely incinerated.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/200█
**Location:** ███████, West Virginia.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Class-B amnestics were administered to all witnesses. The burnt books were explained as vandalism. As Foundation agents on site were unable to determine any potential causes of the fires, the library, its employees, and all who were present on the day of the incident will be under passive surveillance until no earlier than 20██.

**Event Description:** During a bank robbery, all hostages (██ customers, ██ employees) were spontaneously transformed into immobile naked skeletons; transformation is visible on all security cameras. Thieves fired several shots, damaging six skeletons and breaking two windows, then abandoned the robbery and fled the scene. As local law enforcement entered the bank, all skeletons instantly reverted to clothed living humans, with no memory of the robbery having occurred; hostages whose skeletons were damaged by gunfire immediately experienced corresponding injuries (three fatally).
**Date of Occurrence**: ██/██/199█
**Location**: [REDACTED], Nebraska.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Class-B amnestics administered to all surviving witnesses. Deaths of hostages explained as results of unsuspected congenital vascular defects; autopsies reveal no anomalies. Thieves die in multi-vehicle collision while attempting to evade police pursuit; autopsies reveal no anomalies. Footage from security cameras confiscated. Damage to bank premises explained as result of vandals.

**Event Description**: After Long Island citizen ███████ ██████ died of alcohol-damage related illness, a recliner chair in his home began ascending at speeds of exactly 3.6m/s before eventually accelerating to 16.3m/s. Attempts at stopping the ascent were futile, and the chair broke through any barriers placed in its way. It has since then left the atmosphere and is believed to be orbiting Jupiter.
**Date of Occurrence**: 2/15/201█
**Location**: ███████████, New York.
**Follow-up Actions Taken**: Any footage of the incident was wiped and pulled off the internet. Class-A Amnestics were given to witnesses. Foundation operatives in various space programs are advised to destroy any information of the chair if found.

**Event Description:** Eighty-eight thousand, eight hundred and eighty-eight citizens of the state of New Jersey fractured their left scaphoid bones within a two-hour period; radiography showed that all fractures were identical down to a sub-millimeter level.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** Various hospitals throughout New Jersey.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Class-A amnestics administered to radiography technicians.

**Event Description:** Viewers of the popular late-night talk show ████ █████ ██ ███ █████ reported seeing two different episodes. Approximately 40% watched an episode featuring the famous actor █████ ███ and the musical guest ██ ██████ , while the other 60% watched an episode with ██ ██████ with appearance by stand-up comedian ████ ██. Neither one of these episodes was the one which had actually broadcast, and neither one has ever been filmed.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** TV sets throughout the US that were tuned on ███.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** All recordings of the anomalous episodes showed the actual broadcast episode in later viewings. Viewer's memories of the anomalous episodes seem to have completely faded by themselves by ██/██/████. ███ channel officials who had been contacted about the episodes were administered Class C amnestics and their internal investigation into the matter aborted. Social networks mentioning the matter were intercepted and edited.

**Event Description:** A parrot was owned by the █████ family was discovered to have the ability to sing the entirety of the song "Crazy Train" by John Michael "Ozzy" Osbourne, including vocals, guitar, bass, drums, and keyboard. No member of the family ever recalls the parrot hearing it.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** ███ ████████, Connecticut, USA.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Class A amnestics distributed to to the █████ family; parrot seized and ensconced in the Site 19 Anomalous Wildlife Habitat.

**Event Description:** For approximately 12 minutes, all shed human blood within a 15-km radius of ██████, France spontaneously turned into centipedes. All centipedes in the area turned back into blood following the cessation of the event. 
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** ██████, France.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Aerosolized amnestics were deployed over the town. Additional amnestics were distributed to women on menstrual periods during the event, due to extreme emotional distress rendering the aerosolized version ineffective.

**Event Description:** All written text in the Theater Department at ██████-██ University spontaneously converted to Wingdings. Digital text remained unaffected until printed out. All affected text contained the phrase "You don't need a script to pretend to be someone else, you're doing it right now! ( ・ω・)"
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/2014
**Location:** Staten Island, New York.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Class A amnestics were administered to all students and faculty present. Affected books were incinerated, and are currently being replaced. 

**Event Description:** A translucent digital clock approximately 3 km across appeared in the sky about 1.5 km above the ground. The anomaly counted down from 05:55. It stopped short at 01:13 before disappearing completely.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/2006
**Location:** Devon Island, Nunavut, Canada.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Anomaly was only witnessed by a single fishing trawler. Class C amnestics issued to the entire crew.

**Event Description:** A single specimen of //Dionaea muscipula//, better known as the Venus flytrap, expanded to approximately 2.5m tall and consumed a domesticated cat. The specimen expired shortly after and was reported by passing civilians.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** ████, ██████ ██████.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Class A amnestics issued to witnesses. Specimen taken for future studying.

**Event Description:** Ten minutes before opening to the general public, three visit team staff and a security officer at ██████ Museum witnessed a //Scutigera coleoptrata// specimen, commonly known as a house centipede, emerge from a small drainage pipe in a storage closet. The specimen travelled approximately 1 m before entering a sink u-bend which had been opened for repairs. Specimen was estimated to be over 12 m in length, though of average width and height for its species. Specimen was visible for several minutes after the head portion had entered the u-bend, while the remainder of its body continued to exit the drainage pipe.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** ████, Minnesota.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Class A amnestics administered to museum personnel. Facility plumbing was fully examined by foundation personnel, and specimen could not be located. Presumed to have escaped into city sewer network. Communications watch placed on ████ Public Works to monitor for future reports.

**Event Description:** The Cincinnati metropolitan area and all objects and lifeforms in it became greyscale for approximately 77 hours, starting at approximately 10:00 AM. All humans in the metropolitan area when the change occurred were not aware of the existence of color while the effect persisted. Those who entered the area of effect after the change occurred were not affected, but affected individuals treated them with fear and suspicion. When the change was reverted through unknown means, all individuals within the affected area lost their memories of the event, although those who had left the area of effect before the restoration of color retained their memories.
**Date of Occurrence:** 3/21/2014 through 3/23/2014
**Location:** Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Class A amnestics administered to individuals who retained memories of the event, and all records of the event destroyed.

**Event Description:** All weights within the ██████&Son Gym assumed a red coloration for a period of five hours. All the affected weights possessed a white sticker reporting the words "**Tired of the old, boring, black weights? (T_T) ██-██ ##red|Try the red ones! (*A*) ██-██##**".
**Date of Occurrence:** 2014/██/██
**Location:** Birmingham, England, UK.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Class-B amnestics were administered to all witnesses. All weights were taken in custody for further studying. Following the event, the objects displayed no apparent anomalous effect. However, closer inspections revealed that the words "Brought to you by the Kobayashi Athletics" were inscribed on the items. All weights were replaced by new ones. The establishment is to be kept under surveillance until 2016/██/██.

**Event Description:** Two individuals were observed to spend seven hours attempting to move past each other in a narrow hallway before one collapsed from exhaustion, at which point the other decided to take a different route. There is no indication, either from recorded footage of the event or from the testimony of the involved parties, that this was intentional or involuntary.
**Date of Occurrence:** 2014/██/██
**Location:** Boston, Massachusetts office of ██████████.
**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Affected subjects were provided with appropriate medical care and amnestics were administered to all known witnesses. The hallway in question and the affected subjects have shown no anomalous properties before or since.

**Event Description:** During a public concert in the town of ██████, Georgia, a large number of //Procyon lotor// (common raccoon) assembled behind the outdoor concert stage, and started constructing an object resembling a shrine out of materials they had collected from various places around the town, including branches, pine cones, fast-food wrappers, old newspaper, and a trash-can lid. After the shrine was constructed, the raccoons proceeded to make motions described by onlookers as "bowing" to the shrine, and then quickly scattered. Upon attempted destruction of the shrine by civilian Joseph ███████, a large and aggressive nursery of raccoons emerged, numbering more than 100 by most witness accounts. The nursery proceeded to assault Joseph ███████, resulting in his death.
**Date of Occurrence:** █/██/20██
**Location:** ██████, Georgia, USA
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** All those who witnessed the event given Class-A amnestics. Death of Joseph ███████ covered up with a report of a violent mugging. Concert zone acquired by Foundation under the cover of construction. Shrine destroyed by small explosives from a safe distance under the same cover of construction. Observational post disguised as a bird sanctuary constructed. No other anomalous occurrences to date.

**Event Description:** All moths in a 5 kilometer radius of a single porch light made their way towards the light and gathered there for an hour. The moths then dispersed into the surrounding area.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** ████████, ██
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** No special actions, due to lack of witnesses at time of event. The area is to be observed for more anomalous activity until 1/1/████.

**Event Description:** A large, ten-centimeter thick layer of snow suddenly fell over the town of ██████, Massachusetts and coated the entire area. No clouds were visible at the time and despite sudden shifts in supported weight no buildings or structures were damaged.
**Date of Occurrence:** █/██/1999
**Location:** ██████, Massachusetts.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** A sample of the snow was obtained; it was found to be mundane. All residents of the town administered Class-A amnestics. As the event occurred quickly, very little video footage was captured. However, all documentation of the event has been destroyed.

**Event Description:** For a period of approximately five hours, ██████ residents of Pompano Beach, Florida and ████ non-residents working in the city, including ██ Foundation employees, experienced a shared hallucination. Interviews with those effected have provided a detailed, highly consistent account of the entire city being transported to the surface of a planet (believed to be Venus), protected by a dome of unknown design. (See Document E-41567-██ for full account.) However, telephone records, security camera feeds and interviews with non-resident non-employees suggest that nothing unusual happened during the time period and that all those affected were present on Earth and went about their business as normal.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/2011
**Location:** Pompano Beach, Florida, USA.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Affected individuals provided with amnestics after interview. Foundation personnel involved in the event have been commended for controlling media coverage. Amnestic treatment has successfully removed memories of the event. Further monitoring is counterindicated.

**Event Description:** Towards the end of a show, musician █████████████ began sweating profusely. For 6 minutes, the sweat fell to the floor and pooled together, forming into various miniature trains. Following this, the trains rapidly evaporated.
**Date of Occurrence:** 05/22/2015
**Location:** ██████, ██, USA.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Witnesses (including the musician) were administered Class-A amnestics. No further action was required, and the show was generally well received.

**Event Description:** Over an eight-minute period, six hundred and ninety-seven lightning strikes occurred within a twenty-mile wide radius around Faeto, Italy. Meteorological data shows that the locations of these strikes formed a "smiley." At the same time, all drinking water within the settlement was, according to anecdotal evidence, icy cold, scented of strawberries, and could not be boiled or otherwise heated.
**Date of Occurrence:** 2015/07/01
**Location:** Faeto, Italy.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Water supplies and meteorological data throughout Apulia to be monitored over a six-month period.

**Event Description:** Commencing at 07:31, all instances of the Basenji breed of //Canis lupus familiaris// barked constantly for one minute and forty three seconds. Commencement/cessation of barking was not linked to any external stimuli.
**Date of Occurrence:** 2015/07/03
**Location:** Australia.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Fallopia, Agent [REDACTED]'s Basenji, taken for post-anomaly testing. No anomalous activity noted since.

**Event Description:** At approximately █:26 AM local time, a train bound from █████████ to █████ (hereafter Train-A) collided with an identical train moving along the same line from █████ to █████████ (hereafter Train-B). Of the 56 casualties observed, only 28 civilians were identified. Each civilian was identified twice, with one instance riding Train-A and the other instance riding Train-B. Examination shows that all electronic and time-keeping devices present on Train-B at the time of collision were 9 hours slow. All passengers are confirmed to have been traveling on the route of Train-B 9 hours before the event, though without incident. Temporal interference has been suggested, though the cause is currently unknown and the logical paradox the situation represents has been deemed unsolvable. Whether all civilians involved caught the same train as one another twice consecutively as the result of coincidence or the effect of causal manipulation is unknown. No passengers of either train survived the impact.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/2015
**Location:** ███████████ train line, Victoria, Australia.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** All Train-B passengers were removed from the scene and taken into Foundation custody, currently kept in Site-██ cold storage. The ███████████ train line has been put under observation for further extranormal activity over a 6 month period, which is yet uneventful.

**Event Description:** Starting at 2:22 PM, all users in the ████████ chatroom ceased conversation and began to repeat the phrase "nag gimno bgaithu sa yginno alibgn yamoa gna as ahud ak" at two second intervals.  This behavior continued for two hours before ceasing.  No users seemed to recall the event, claiming that a regular conversation had occurred.  Many users claimed to have closed the chat window or left their computer during the course of the event, despite the fact that their corresponding chat handles continued to repeat the phrase throughout the event.  Users who joined the chat room while the event was underway did not participate in the event but did not type anything until after the event was finished.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/2015
**Location:** Computers around the world, most concentrated in the United States.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** All screenshots of the conversation were deleted, and the █████████ chatroom has been placed under surveillance for further anomalous behavior.

**Event Description:** For a period of approximately 3 minutes, no less than 10,000 calls were made to the number 1-800-███-████ for the [REDACTED] for ███. Records indicate that all calls came from a single number and further investigation indicates that the number is currently in use by an employee of the company who did call that day but was held up in the queue. At the 3-minute mark, all calls vanished completely from the queue. 
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** █████, ██████ ████, Philippines, calls were documented to come from the employee's address in ████, USA.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Call records for the time frame when the calls occurred were expunged from the system and false records inputted during a routine system maintenance the next day. Class-B amnestics were administered to all parties involved while the employee was monitored for the next 3 months but no anomalous activity was noted.

**Event Description:** At roughly 2:30 PM, sixteen (16) city buses pulled up to a movie theater owned by a private company; all buses were packed full. All people aboard the buses (bus drivers included) as well as the owner of the movie theater shared the same first name: "Greg". Furthermore, the Gregs' all came to the location to see the same movie, "████: ███ █████". Said movie had a Greg starring in the lead role. There was no convention of any sorts occurring at the time in the town, nor any in the world at that time that was summoning people with the name "Greg". 
**Date of Occurrence:** 3/17/199█
**Location:** Greg's Theater, █████████, Pennsylvania, USA.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Interviews with all 1267 Gregs' involved as well as their families found that this had not been a planned event, and that 97% of all people involved did not know anyone else that had attended prior to the event. No records indicate that there was any advertisements or events that would have sparked such an occurrence. All Gregs' and witnesses involved were given Class-A amnestics. A cover-up story involving a Greg convention was released, and no further incident occurred after cover-up was released. Theater was monitored for two years, but aside from a reduced crime rate for the first two weeks after the event no anomalous activity occurred.
**Note:** //This was easily the most confusing case I've ever had to deal with.// -Agent Greg

**Event Description:** At 8:30 AM local time, a 911 call was made. Said call reported a construction worker had broken his neck. Ambulance arrived three minutes later, and OSWA arrived within twenty minutes. Undercover Agent ████████ was among the OSWA Workers. Investigation found that the construction helmet somehow went from a standard weight of 10 ounces/283 grams to a weight of 37 pounds/16.7 kilograms upon the worker putting it onto his head.

**Date of Occurrence:** 5/10/2016
**Location:** Osceola, Tennessee, although amnestics were administered to a group of journalists in neighboring Dyersburg, Tennessee to prevent the spread of information regarding the mass fainting incident.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** All afflicted attendees and any nearby media personnel were dosed with Class-B amnestics; the amnestics were able to remove memories of the mass fainting episode, but did nothing to change the purported food preferences of those affected. In response, the town council of Osceola voted to cancel their 4th Annual Ribfest. Instead, their 1st Annual Indian Foodfair will take place in summer 2017, exact date TBD.

A 20 cm chef's knife belonging to ████ was found on the nearby counter top, piercing through a 2 cm thick solid wood cutting board and partially embedded into the linoleum beneath. In an interview, ████'s roommate and partner, ██-██ ███, said ████ had been preparing vegetables for dinner. ███ left the kitchen and returned less than a minute later to find the body, having heard nothing out of the ordinary.
**Date of Occurrence:** 05/09/2016
**Location:** Sogong-dong, Jung-gu, Seoul, South Korea
**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Body, skin, knife and cutting board confiscated and placed in storage. No anomalies detected. Amnestics administered to ████'s family and ███. Death covered up as a suicide.

**Event Description:** Surveillance camera staff at the natural reserve near Puerto Madero, Buenos Aires City, Argentina, saw what appeared to be the same man in two different parts of the park at the same time, apparently mirroring each other's movements despite the lack of line of sight between the two. The individuals then disappeared into the brush. People in the reserve at that time talked about a weird man talking to himself about the '████ing Paraguayans" before walking off-road.
**Date of Occurrence:** 01/██/2018
**Location:** Natural reserve, Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, Argentine Republic.
**Follow-up actions taken:** Surveillance tapes of the strange men confiscated, surveillance staff administered Class-B Amnestics, two (2) Foundation agents disguised as birdwatchers assigned to the park to look for possible developments.

**Event Description:** Thirty people within the 30th Street Station had their clothing instantaneously switched with that of another person.
**Date of Occurrence:** 2017-03-04
**Location:** Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** All witnesses were administered Class-A Amnestics, and security footage was confiscated.  All articles of clothing were taken for observation and replaced with duplicates.  Investigations revealed no connections between the thirty affected individuals aside from their presence in the station at the time of the event.

**Event Description:** For 27 minutes and 39 seconds, all shredded lettuce within fifteen different ██████ ████ fast food restaurants suddenly turned into human foot fungus. This effect did not occur  to lettuce in any other ██████ ████ restaurants, or to any lettuce that was on food ordered through the drive-thru window. Consumption of fungus was reported to lead to an unnatural case of the chills. After the 27:39 duration, the uneaten fungus turned back into lettuce.
**Date of Occurrence:** 11/11/2017 
**Location:** 15 different ██████ ████ restaurants, USA.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** All employees and customers in the restaurants at the time were administered Class-A Amnestics. A sample of the lettuce was collected and sent to Site 4-████ for examination, but no anomalous effects were found.

**Event Description:** An intestinal tumor located in the body of Grover ███████, a 52-year-old man from Des Moines, Iowa, is found to contain an entire secondary brain, including medulla, pituitary gland, and  part of a spinal cord. DNA from the brain does not match that of Mr. ███████, and is currently believed to belong to a twelve year-old girl who vanished from Calgary, Alberta, Canada in 1992.
**Date of Occurrence:** 04/05/2010
**Location:** Des Moines, Iowa
**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Doctors involved with the surgery amnesticized. Mr. ███████ died following the surgery. Despite several autopsies and examinations, no definitive cause of death has been determined. His cadaver, as well as the brain excised from his stomach, remain in cold storage.

**Event Description:** $237,981 appeared to have manifested simultaneously, spread across various countries on flat surfaces at approximately $1.3 per square kilometer. This money changed to a different currency depending on the country it manifested within.
**Date of Occurrence:** 5/9/2014
**Location:**  World wide.
**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** None, due to the very obscure nature of the event, and that 87% of all the manifested money was made unusable from external forces.

**Event Description:** The PA system in a Giant Eagle supermarket announced, "Attention Giant Eagle shoppers: the ritual will now commence," whereupon all individuals within the store stopped what they were doing and hummed an intricate series of notes for approximately five minutes. After another tone, the humming ceased and all affected individuals resumed their business as though nothing had occurred.
**Date of Occurrence:** 10/10/2014
**Location:** Columbus, Ohio
**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Event would not have come to Foundation attention if not for discovery on security footage during in-store theft investigation. Individuals affected during event have no memory thereof. As such, it has been determined that attempting to identify and interview each person visible on the tape is unfeasible. Videos confiscated, amnestics administered to store staff, and Foundation agents stationed at Giant Eagle supermarkets to monitor for future events or signs of PA system tampering.
**Update:** As of 27/04/2016, surveillance of Giant Eagle stores has produced no further evidence of anomalous activity. Agents recalled.

**Event Description:** Every human on earth simultaneously blinked. During the event ███ people disappeared.
**Date of Occurrence:** 3/5/18
**Location:** Earth
**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Various cover up stories to explain missing persons.
**Note:** //Blinking caused a minor containment breach at various sites due to SCPs pertaining to line of sight//

**Event Description:** Between 16:00:04 UST and 19:53:02 UST, black hole Cygnus X-1 underwent a series of rapid fluctuations in registered x-ray flux density, up to 194.2% of the normal value. When converted into Morse Code, the fluctuations spelled out an expanded, 2018 updated version of the 1988 book //A Brief History of Time// by the recently deceased physicist Stephen William Hawking. Analysis shows the writing style of the updates to be consistent with that of the original author.
**Date of Occurrence:** 3/14/18
**Location:** Cygnus X-1
**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Non-Foundation observers were administered Class-A Amnestics, and the observation data in question was covered up. Cygnus X-1 is to be monitored for further anomalies. Whether to release the book under an appropriate cover story is currently under debate.

**Event Description:** For 5 hours, all animals under the genus //Bos// became antimemetic. During this time, the word "cow" replaced the term "pattern screamer". Shortly after the event, [[[scp-3930|Dr. Kuzkin]]] began screaming the word "cow" in his sleep. This activity lasted for 6 minutes before Dr. Kuzkin woke up.
**Date of Occurrence:** 8/29/2018
**Location:** Worldwide.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Dr. Kuzkin was given the proper medical attention shortly after the event. No further actions were needed, as it seems all human life cannot remember this event occurring. As such, this event was able to be recorded using SCP-████.

**Event Description:** Several handheld radios from MTF units started transmitting from various locations despite no MTF units active or present in the area. Each transmitted with the following callsigns: Z9-1, Z9-2, Z9-3, Z9-BETA1, Z9-BETA4, Y24-2, Y24-CAP, 09-BRAVO. All were unresponsive to contact, but screaming, yelling(the subject of black mass, black leeches, and a bright light), audible sobbing("They got Randall" and "God save us" were only intelligible), and "It's not cold anymore. Its not water anymore, either. And there is no longer a snake in my head." is heard.
**Date of Occurrence:** 12/27-28/17, 3/15/18 (7:43-7:58 AM)
**Location:** Central Europe, mainly in the Swiss and Austrian Alps.
**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** --Channels closed off temporarily for sake of research. After 90 days, no anomalous activity was reported or heard, and channel reopened for Foundation use.-- Anomalous activity repeated on 3/15/18 for 15 minutes, see update.
**Update(3/15/18):**  An additional transmission was received on a secure Foundation frequency, and had no Foundation callsign. Speaker is an unidentified female voice; dialogue is as follows: "Sorry about that a month-ish ago. Don't worry. In fact, you'll all see them again soon. Tell their families that, too. You'll see them soon." Voice did not respond to any attempts to communicate.
**Note:** See if it corresponds to any MTF unit logs. Or MTF operator deaths. Or something. Just find out who those voices belonged to. -Agent ████

**Event Description:** All water in the Samur River was converted to human blood for four days.  All water which flowed into the river was converted into blood, and all blood which flowed out of the river was converted to water.  
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/2018-██/██/2018
**Location:** Samur River, Russia and Azerbaijan
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Amnestics were dispersed aerially through the nearby village of 
Samurçay following completion of event.  DNA analysis of collected blood compared against the Foundation database identified all blood as originating from one Joshua Havaldar, a 34-year-old Indian-American man living in San Francisco.  He was unable to provide information on the event, but did report feeling light-headed at several points in the week leading up to the event.  Mr. Havaldar was administered Class-A Amnestics following interview.  Both the Samur River and Mr. Havaldar are currently under a standard five-year monitoring period.

**Event Description:** A small canoe in the Mississippi River was consumed whole by a //Carcharocles megalodon//, along with its two occupants. //Carcharocles megalodon// has been extinct for 2.6 million years, and the river in question is much too shallow to contain a creature of that size.
**Date of Occurrence:** 02/14/2018
**Location:** Undisclosed location on the Mississippi River, USA
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Amnestics were administered to witnesses, and a cover-up story was circulated claiming the canoe occupants were intoxicated and capsized their vessel accidentally. A task force was sent to locate and capture //Carcharocles megalodon//, but all attempts to locate the specimen failed.

**Event Description**: All objects within a recreational park spontaneously began to ricochet at speeds of 0.7 m/s, each increasing by about 0.3 m/s for each impact with a surface or object such as the ground and other affected objects, with the highest speed being nearly 19 m/s. Objects such as benches, pieces of pavement and tree bark and lamp posts continued ricocheting for 1 minute and 17 seconds before suddenly ceasing movement. 23 civilian casualties were reported along with 6 deaths and the remaining 17 severely injured. Objects from the park were reported to have landed in further away areas.
**Date of Occurrence**: 4/9/2018
**Location**: ██████, Florida
**Follow-up Actions Taken**: Eye witnesses and survivors were treated with Class A amnestics. Local and social media reports were successfully destroyed. Area is kept under surveillance until further notice. Reported deaths were covered up with a park massacre event.

**Event Description:** A family (Shuttleworths) reported to seeing a gigantic traffic cone flying across the skies around 4:00 PM. "It was huge man, had to be around 500 feet tall, at least. I'm tellin ya the truth sir!" -David Shuttlesworth
The family reported the traffic cone dissolve into the air about 5 minutes afterwards. The 
Camp Frank D. Merrill Military Base reported having a "Massive object in the radar" hovering over Blue Ridge.
**Date of Occurrence:** 26/5/10
**Location:** Blue Ridge, Georgia
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** The military base was told not to tell anyone about this. The media describes the family as "Crazy" or they think that the family set this up out of boredom.
 Don't take any further actions, just let the media think they are crazy. -Doctor Oliver

**Event Description:** Every gun within the area began to fire without using actual ammunition, instead firing what was identified as lead balls. Ammunition that was loaded into the weapons was not depleted or used in any fashion, and the guns fired with the same recoil, accuracy, and rate. There was no change in the size of the lead balls that were shot, even with a change in the barrel size. This event continued for fifteen hours until the weapons began to fire normally once more. 
**Date of Occurrence:** 30/3/17
**Location:** Dallas Fort-Worth (DFW), Texas
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** After recovering most, if not every shot and confiscating three weapons from a firing range in the area, no anomalous properties of the guns or the lead balls could be sourced. Local media was observed, but no other abnormalities were reported in the area. A local amnesiac was distributed through the water systems of the area in order to prevent possible spreading/knowing of the incident.

**Event Description:** Site-38 disappeared for 1 hour and 34 minutes, everything in there was gone. After that everything was put back into place including all personnel and all SCPS. When personnel were asked what happened they acted confused and said that we were crazy.
**Date Of Occurrence:** ██/██/13
**Location:** Rural Tennessee, United States
**Follow-up Actions taken:** Personnel had no recollection of the event, so there is no need to give any amnestics, also, they are personnel.

**Event Description:** Unscheduled subway train passes through 36th Street subway station in Brooklyn at approximately 80mph. Eye witnesses describe the train as purple with Arabic lettering on the side. Train wasn't reported appearing anywhere else.
**Date of Occurrence:** 07/03/2017
**Location:** 36th Street, Brooklyn New York, USA.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Cover story established. Train driver distracted by passengers and loses control of train. Security camera footage closely inspected but deemed safe.

**Event Description:** During a Toys R Us staff meeting, an employee later identified as William J. Horack stood, announced, "Well, guess I won't need these anymore," and removed his lips with one hand. Afterward, he began to consume the remaining flesh around his mouth -- described by witnesses as having the appearance of "pulled pork" -- as the other employees returned to normal operations. Horack continued to autocannibalize over the course of the day, captured only intermittently by security cameras despite not leaving the meeting room. At 19:05, Horack had been reduced to skeletal remains, which then vanished. Eyewitnesses reported confusion that the event did not strike them at the time as being out of the ordinary.
**Date of Occurrence:** 15/03/2018
**Location:** Mayfield Heights, Ohio, USA
**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Amnestics distributed to store employees and customers after interviews conducted. Investigation of security cameras revealed no fault. No personal information about William Horack could be attained, and all documentation involved in his three-year employment at Toys R Us appeared to be an intricate forgery. Lips retrieved from initial event location, determined to be thin plastic.

**Event Description:** EVERYONE IS DEAD, EXCEPT ME. EVERYTHING IS DEAD, EXCEPT ME. TIME HAS STOPPED. AM I CERTAIN ABOUT THIS, I DONT KNOW..

**Event Description:** It seems everyone, in the whole word, went unconscious. This is one of many theories of what happened. On every clock, a whole hour was skipped ahead. No one had recollection of this event. All technology was turned off and turned back on when the hour ended. Clocks still functioned when the technology was turned off. All SCP objects were affected during this hour, not causing any damage. SCP-1032 did not detect this event.
**Date of Occurrence:** 12/31/99
**Location:** Earth
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Popular proposed event, Y2K, was blamed for the cause of this event. Y2K could have been the cause of this event. No one truly knows how this was caused.

**Event Description:** Multiple eyewitnesses report seeing a large creature crawl across the face of the Moon. The creature was almost unanimously described as spider-like with 4 to 6 legs, and stated to be large enough to take up approximately 1/3 of the Moon's surface. Witnesses report the entity appeared from a shadowed area of the Moon, and seemed to rapidly crawl around to the back side. This detail was shared by all viewers and may rule out the possibility of an object simply passing between Earth and the Moon.
**Date of Occurrence:** 03/26/18
**Location:** Moon
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Low-effort disinformation campaign was implemented in the form of agents calling/writing into various conspiracy shows describing the event. This has been successful in placating and shaming the witnesses into silence. Greater populations are not aware of this event. Foundation assets in orbit around the Moon will continue to monitor for any reoccurrence of possible anomalous activity for 1 year before returning to standard operations.

**Event Description:** Over the course of five days, the entire student population of ██████ ██ Elementary School in ██████, Ohio developed allergies to all nut-based food products.  Faculty and individuals not attending ██████ ██ Elementary who enter the building were unaffected. The symptoms ceased if individuals were removed from the premises for sixty-two hours. Notably, a student at the school, Isaac ██████, is currently comatose following a severe allergic reaction as a result of being force-fed a peanut butter sandwich.
**Date of Occurrence:** 02/19-02/23/2018
**Location:** ██████, Ohio
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** School was shuttered, students were integrated into other elementary schools in the area. Isaac ██████'s condition has shown no improvements. Foundation medical staff are currently attempting to treat and revive him in an attempt to find a link between his current state and the anomaly within  ██████ ██ Elementary.

**Event Description:** All canned food sold at Miller's Supermarket in ██████, Iowa was found to contain one or more live specimens of //Lampropeltis triangulum// (milk snake) in place of their intended contents. X-ray imaging shows that prior to opening, the cans contained their intended contents, and only upon opening do the snakes appear.
**Date of Occurrence:** 4/18/2017
**Location:** ██████, Iowa
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Anomaly ceased within twelve hours of its first manifestation. Amnestics were administered to all affected, dispatch logs recording emergency calls of the event were scrubbed.  All milk snakes contained by the Foundation have yet to show anomalous properties.

**Event Description:** Researcher Presley Bunson fell asleep at his desk at approximately 11:00 AM, which is currently believed to be non-anomalous in cause-- due to an increased workload, Bunson had not slept for more than three hours nightly over the course of the past week. However, after being awoken by a coworker five minutes later, Bunson reported having a dream in which he was a Dutch talk show host. At the same time as Bunson's dream, Humberto Tan, host of the Dutch late night talk show //RTL Late Night//, reportedly started acting "like a completely different person" during a taping session, seemingly unaware of where he was or what he was supposed to be doing and displaying a limited command of the Dutch language. After five minutes, he reverted to his regular personality with no memory of what happened in that timespan. Post-incident analysis indicated that Bunson's reports of the dream and recordings/witness reports of the events in the studio were almost identical-- in particular, all actions taken by Bunson in the dream were taken by Tan in real life, and Tan's apparent knowledge of Dutch was generally consistent with Bunson's.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/2018
**Location:** Linguistic Analysis Division of Site-19 and NH Schiller Hotel in Amsterdam, Netherlands
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** All witnesses present at the taping of //RTL Late Night// were amnesticized, and the Foundation seized all recordings of the event. The affected segment was re-taped without incident. Researcher Bunson and Humberto Tan are currently under a standard five-year monitoring period, and no further anomalous activity has been noticed from either of them thus far. None of the documents Bunson was working with have been conclusively identified as the source of the anomaly. Although not strictly related to the anomaly, Researcher Bunson's workload has been temporarily decreased and he is currently working with Foundation doctors to maintain a more healthy sleep schedule.

Class-A amnestics were delivered via aerosol to the student body and local authorities.

**Event Description:** A Wendy's restaurant was replaced by a large mass of what appeared to be human hair. (Sampling was not possible.) The substance originated from a 3.5 meter tall structure resembling a human skull embedded in the restaurant's parking lot. Nearby witnesses expressed concern over whether the restaurant would reopen in time for service, but otherwise did not find the event cause for concern. An hour after Foundation containment was established, the restaurant returned to its normal status. Event lasted just over three hours.
**Date of Occurrence:** 13/09/2018
**Location:**  Pasadena, California, USA
**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Amnestics administered to direct witnesses.
