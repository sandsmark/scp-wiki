title:Log of Extranormal Events
**Forward:** This page is to document anomalous events that have attracted the Foundation's interests, but occured too briefly for the Foundation to secure or contain them. Instead, the Foundation deploys a cover-up team to conceal the evidence from the public. This is merely a reminder to agents and researchers that not all of them can be contained.
-Agent Carriontrooper

**Event Description:** Footage from surveying vessel "Calypso" recorded several bright flashes on ocean bottom, similar in intensity and duration to hand grenades being fired.

**Event Description:** Time skips between 2.5 and ██ hours take place in ████████████, North Carolina before normalizing to one day after initial skip. Non self-correcting electronic devices such as digital clocks are seemingly unaffected and display incorrect times at different areas of the town.

**Location:** ████████████, North Carolina (███ █████, Nevada)
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Local news reports electromagnetic interference caused by local power plant. Small observation team assigned to area.

**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** ████████.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Population dosed with Class B Amnesiacs and a cover story was established.  A road accident with a Samson-Craig Products (an SCP front company) chemical tanker was staged, an emergency evacuation camp was arranged and the population given £███ per head compensation.  In the ██ years since there event there has been no recurrence or abnormal behaviour in the population.

**Event Description:** Three similar looking men were witnessed fighting in a gas station parking lot. Eyewitness reports maintain that each man claimed to be ██████ █████████, a well known local car salesman, and were fighting over which individual was the "true" one. Two of the men were killed when the third procured a crowbar. The third was fatally shot by a local police officer.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** █████, Oklahoma
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Witnesses and involved persons were questioned and given Class B Amnesiacs. Close family members of ██████ █████████ were questioned and given Class A Amnesiacs.

**Location:** ██████, Puerto Rico
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Witnesses were issued Class B Amnesiacs. All recording devices were confiscated. Relevant photographs are available in the Foundation Archives.

The toystore, it's employees and the surrounding area was put under surveillance for three (3) weeks, and was marked as a POI in Foundation documents on █████. The brand of action figures and the factory that produced the relevant batch were investigated by covert agents. Nothing of interest was found.

**Follow-up Actions Taken:** The only footage of the event recorded was taken by The Foundation as part of The Foundation's investigations into SCP-███.  As such knowledge of the event has been allowed to persist as an urban myth.  SCP-███'s monitoring will also detect any recurrences, although none have appeared.

Pending further additions.
