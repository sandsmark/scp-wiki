**Foreword:** This page is to document anomalous events that have attracted the Foundation's interests, but occurred too briefly for the Foundation to secure or contain them. Instead, the Foundation deploys a cover-up team to conceal the evidence from the public. This is merely a reminder to agents and researchers that not all of them can be contained.
-Agent Carriontrooper

**Event Description:** The lost continent of Lemuria appeared quietly and 5 Lemurians materialized, and entered Sri Lanka.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** Sri Lanka
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Agents, working as journalists reported the story as normal, but only said a group called "Lemuria" created the Lemurians and also disinformed public that they were people in costumes.

**Event Description:** A naked, glowing humanoid figure appeared suddenly in the city's subway and seen by several eyewitnesses and captured by the security cameras. It disappeared after a few seconds.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** ███████, Spain.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** A team of disguised agents and a makeshift holographic projection unit were taken on location. Team explained that the incident was a part of their avant-garde 'urban shock art' exhibition all over Europe. Fake viral media planted to give credence to the team's supposed art group.

**Event Description:** Time skips between 2.5 and ██ hours took place in ████████████, North Carolina before normalizing to one day after initial skip. Non self-correcting electronic devices such as digital clocks were seemingly unaffected and displayed incorrect times in different areas of the town. Event bears similarity to a relatively unnoticed event in ███ █████, Nevada, though no connection could be traced between the two events.
**Date of Occurrence:** █/██/████
**Location:** ████████████, North Carolina (███ █████, Nevada).
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Local news reported electromagnetic interference caused by local power plant. Small observation team assigned to area.

**Event Description:** ████████, Wales, was found to be abandoned. The population was found comatose in a nearby field. ██ hours after the estimated time of the event, the population awoke with no recollection of the event.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** ████████.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Population dosed with Class B Amnestics and a cover story was established. A road accident with a Samson-Craig Products (an SCP front company) chemical tanker was staged, an emergency evacuation camp was arranged and the population given £███ per head compensation. In the ██ years since the event there has been no recurrence or abnormal behaviour in the population.

**Event Description:** Three similar looking men were witnessed fighting in a gas station parking lot. Eyewitness reports maintain that each man claimed to be ██████ █████████, a well known local car salesman, and were fighting over which individual was the "true" one. Two of the men were killed when the third procured a crowbar. The third was fatally shot by a local police officer.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** █████, Oklahoma.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Witnesses and involved persons were questioned and given Class B Amnestics. Close family members of ██████ █████████ were questioned and given Class A Amnestics. A cover story involving the individual's suicide was established. The three bodies were recovered for autopsy and are currently maintained in a Site-19 minimum security storage freezer.

**Event Description:** Several students attending █████████ Collegiate began complaining about a loud buzzing noise. A custodian for the school located the source as a single monitor in the computer lab during his duties, and reported the power button was unresponsive. When the lab technicians arrived the next day, they unplugged the monitor after other attempts proved futile. Witnesses of the event report a scream playing through the computer's speakers, and the image of a digitized face screaming appeared for a moment before power was lost.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** █████████ Collegiate in the ██████, ████████, USA.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** The monitor was confiscated and replaced for inspection. Nothing of interest has been found.

**Event Description:** A mission not typically present was located in the MMORPG [REDACTED]. The mission was only accessible via a bugged area of terrain but had existed for an unknown period of time. The mission was an exact replica of Site-██ with several hostile SCPs (not necessarily those housed there) as opponents. No code for the mission was found on the game's server by Foundation Investigation teams.
**Date of Occurrence:** Unknown. Detected ██/██/████
**Location:** Geographical location unclear.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** A viral attack on the server was performed, resulting in a total shut down. After the server was re-initialized the mission was absent. All individuals known to have found the mission have been given Class A Amnestics. There has been no recurrence to date.

**Event Description:** The entire stock of ███████ ███████ souvenirs at the ███████ ███████ stall on the ██████ waterfront were spontaneously altered so that the face of ███████ ███████ was removed. These objects produced a loud screaming sound when exposed to daylight, and all writing implements within the stall formed symbols associated with the Cult of the Demon ██████ when an attempt to write with them was made. 8 days after the event, all altered stock vanished from Foundation storage.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** ███████, Nova Scotia.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** All altered stock seized and impounded, amnestics administered.

**Event Description:** During an automobile accident, the body of ████ ██, a passenger in one involved vehicle, expanded to fill the entire interior of the vehicle. Because Mr. ██'s expanded body had taken on a consistency similar to stiff foam rubber, the other occupants of the vehicle were protected from the impact, and were the only survivors of the crash.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** ██████, Connecticut.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Body confiscated, all other occupants and responding personnel administered Class A amnestics. Tissue tests indicate that Mr. ██ is still alive, though the tissues of his body have become an undifferentiated mass, and tests of neurological function are inconclusive.

**Event Description:** Unidentified and unaccompanied child (estimated age: 7 years old) in hospital waiting room produces more than 400 kilograms of vomit in 5 minutes, before dying; other patients describe hearing sounds of "glass breaking" during the emesis.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** ███████ Public Hospital, ████████████, Madagascar.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Majority of vomit had been incinerated before Foundation agents arrived on-site; inspection of hospital incinerator revealed no anomalies. All remaining samples of vomit were confiscated; analysis revealed no anomalies, except that child had been suffering from salmonella poisoning. Witnesses were given amnestics. Child was never identified; body was removed from hospital morgue and is currently maintained in a Site-19 low-value storage freezer.

**Event Description:** An email is sent to, as near as the Foundation can determine, every active email address in existence, including Foundation intranet-only addresses. The contents are identical across all emails and consist of the following message, in Spanish: "Hi, this is Jorge. It has been fun playing with you, but I am going to visit friends next door now. I will be back later to collect my toys. Take care of the place!" Backtracing reveals that all emails originated from the same unassigned IP address.
**Date of Occurrence:** 12/21/████
**Location:** N/A
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Foundation agents edited the internet-rumor-debunking site ██████.com to include a statement that the email was a massive hoax. The Foundation has periodically mass-emailed similar messages to more limited audiences as a smokescreen. The originating IP address is being monitored for any further activity.

**Event Description:** A man, believed to be ████████ ██████, a suspected associate of the group known as Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd., entered an abandoned factory at ███ ██████ in the Brazilian city of Salvador. Mr. ██████ was being tracked by two Foundation operatives who followed him into the building. A sound of bubbling water followed by gunshots was heard from within the building, and upon entry the operatives found Mr. ██████'s body in a state of advanced decomposition associated with at least three weeks of exposure to the elements, despite only five minutes elapsing between him entering the building and the discovery of the body. A pistol, which had been fired three times, was found in his hand. No sign of his target or possible attacker was found.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/15/████
**Location:** ███ ██████, Salvador, State of Bahia, Brazil.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Information suppressed in local media. Body removed from site by Foundation operatives disguised as Brazilian Federal Police and interred at morgue at Site-██.

**Event Description:** Six sperm whale carcasses were found beached along a 2km stretch of coastline at ████████, New Zealand. When autopsy was performed as part of a civilian research program, it was discovered that the chest cavity of all six whales had been hollowed out postmortem without any damage being done to the exterior of the animals. Exploration of the chest cavity revealed the chest cavity of each whale had somehow been stuffed with what appears to be machinery components trapped in clear plastic.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/18/████
**Location:** ████████, New Zealand.
**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Area sealed. All members of the research team detained and administered Class-A Amnestics. False story disseminated claiming that the decomposition of the whales' bodies had led to the build-up of toxic gas inside the carcasses, leading to government intervention on grounds of public health. Masses found inside body cavities removed and shipped to Storage Site-██. Remains incinerated in the field and disposed of through normal channels.

**Event Description:** The ██████ ██████ flight between Heathrow, London and Hartsfield-Jackson, Atlanta suffered a malfunction and crashed into the Atlantic Ocean, 800 km from the Azores archipelago. Despite this, all passengers and crew walked out the destination gate, remembering only a regular flight.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/11/████
**Location:** North Atlantic Ocean.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Information suppressed and mass amnestic treatment performed, recovery of aircraft underway.

**Event Description:** Every domesticated cat inside the city limits of ██████, Norway travelled 10.9 km SE to ██████████████, Sweden over period of 8 hours. Cats congregated in groupings of 13-25 in a field behind [DATA EXPUNGED] for 2 hours, then dispersed.
**Date of Occurrence:** 25/09/2009
**Location:** Norway/Sweden border.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Cats returned of own accord to their homes. Any footage of gathering confiscated for study. Witnesses processed, debriefed, and administered Class B Amnestic. Field searched for abnormalities, blood and urine samples taken from cats in affected areas. No anomalies found. Both ██████ and the field will be under surveillance until 30/09/2014.

**Event Description:** During a speech to a public committee, the mayor of ████████, FL began continuously chuckling at a pun made by an legislative observer for approximately 4.5 hours straight before collapsing into a nearby chair and passing out. He claims to have no memory of the event, nor did anyone else in the room during the speech. The only available evidence of its occurrence was captured entirely on camera.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/19██
**Location:** ████████, Florida.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Any and all witnesses who videotaped the event, along with anyone who viewed the videotapes themselves were given Class B Amnestics, and all resulting videotapes were wiped clean. The mayor himself is under minor surveillance from select members of the Foundation.

**Event Description**: At exactly 2pm, 24 instances of a semi-erotic calendar appeared in numerous foundation sites. Inside the calendar, images of Dr. Elliot, Dr. Kiryu, Dr. ████, Agent Merlo, Director ██████, Dr. Right, Agent █████, Researcher █████, Agent ████, Dr. Marie, Dr. ████, and Dr. Jack Bright. The Calendar displayed the Name Double D-class, and despite the statement of personal included the calendar shows signs of being planned and professionally made.
**Date of Occurrence**: ██/01/14
**Location**: Sites █, ██, ██, ██, and █
**Follow-up Actions Taken**: Most instances were recovered by foundation staff, several copies have been confiscated from staff since the incident.
**Note:** Dr. Jack Bright at the time was not inhabiting a female body, indicating that either a prop was used or this is a mistake by the creator.

**Event Description**: After Long Island citizen ███████ ██████ died of alcohol-damage related illness, a recliner chair in his home began ascending at speeds of exactly 3.6m/s before eventually accelerating to 16.3m/s. Attempts at stopping the ascent were futile, and the chair broke through any barriers placed in its way. It has since then left the atmosphere and is believed to be orbiting Jupiter.
**Date of Occurrence**: 2/15/201█
**Location**: ███████████, New York.
**Follow-up Actions Taken**: Any footage of the incident was wiped and pulled off the internet. Class-A Amnestics were given to witnesses. Foundation operatives in various space programs are advised to destroy any information of the chair if found.

**Event Description:** Eighty-eight thousand, eight hundred and eighty-eight citizens of the state of New Jersey fractured their left scaphoid bones within a two-hour period; radiography showed that all fractures were identical down to a sub-millimeter level.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** Various hospitals throughout New Jersey.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Class-A amnestics administered to radiography technicians.

**Event Description:** Viewers of the popular late-night talk show ████ █████ ██ ███ █████ reported seeing two different episodes. Approximately 40% watched an episode featuring the famous actor █████ ███ and the musical guest ██ ██████ , while the other 60% watched an episode with ██ ██████ with appearance by stand-up comedian ████ ██. Neither one of these episodes was the one which had actually broadcast, and neither one has ever been filmed.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** TV sets throughout the US that were tuned on ███.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** All recordings of the anomalous episodes showed the actual broadcast episode in later viewings. Viewer's memories of the anomalous episodes seem to have completely faded by themselves by ██/██/████. ███ channel officials who had been contacted about the episodes were administered Class C amnestics and their internal investigation into the matter aborted. Social networks mentioning the matter were intercepted and edited.

**Event Description:** A parrot was owned by the █████ family was discovered to have the ability to sing the entirety of the song "Crazy Train" by John Michael "Ozzy" Osbourne, including vocals, guitar, bass, drums, and keyboard. No member of the family ever recalls the parrot hearing it.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** ███ ████████, Connecticut, USA.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Class A amnestics distributed to to the █████ family; parrot seized and ensconced in the Site 19 Anomalous Wildlife Habitat.

**Event Description:** For approximately 12 minutes, all shed human blood within a 15-km radius of ██████, France spontaneously turned into centipedes. All centipedes in the area turned back into blood following the cessation of the event.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** ██████, France.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Aerosolized amnestics were deployed over the town. Additional amnestics were distributed to women on menstrual periods during the event, due to extreme emotional distress rendering the aerosolized version ineffective.

**Event Description:** All written text in the Theater Department at ██████-██ University spontaneously converted to Wingdings. Digital text remained unaffected until printed out. All affected text contained the phrase "You don't need a script to pretend to be someone else, you're doing it right now! ( ・ω・)"
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/2014
**Location:** Staten Island, New York.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Class A amnestics were administered to all students and faculty present. Affected books were incinerated, and are currently being replaced.

**Event Description:** A translucent digital clock approximately 3 km across appeared in the sky about 1.5 km above the ground. The anomaly counted down from 05:55. It stopped short at 01:13 before disappearing completely.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/2006
**Location:** Devon Island, Nunavut, Canada.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Anomaly was only witnessed by a single fishing trawler. Class C amnestics issued to the entire crew.

**Event Description:** A single specimen of //Dionaea muscipula//, better known as the Venus flytrap, expanded to approximately 2.5m tall and consumed a domesticated cat. The specimen expired shortly after and was reported by passing civilians.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** ████, ██████ ██████.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Class A amnestics issued to witnesses. Specimen taken for future studying.

**Event Description:** Ten minutes before opening to the general public, three visit team staff and a security officer at ██████ Museum witnessed a //Scutigera coleoptrata// specimen, commonly known as a house centipede, emerge from a small drainage pipe in a storage closet. The specimen travelled approximately 1 m before entering a sink u-bend which had been opened for repairs. Specimen was estimated to be over 12 m in length, though of average width and height for its species. Specimen was visible for several minutes after the head portion had entered the u-bend, while the remainder of its body continued to exit the drainage pipe.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** ████, Minnesota.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Class A amnestics administered to museum personnel. Facility plumbing was fully examined by foundation personnel, and specimen could not be located. Presumed to have escaped into city sewer network. Communications watch placed on ████ Public Works to monitor for future reports.

**Event Description:** The Cincinnati metropolitan area and all objects and lifeforms in it became greyscale for approximately 77 hours, starting at approximately 10:00 AM. All humans in the metropolitan area when the change occurred were not aware of the existence of color while the effect persisted. Those who entered the area of effect after the change occurred were not affected, but affected individuals treated them with fear and suspicion. When the change was reverted through unknown means, all individuals within the affected area lost their memories of the event, although those who had left the area of effect before the restoration of color retained their memories.
**Date of Occurrence:** 3/21/2014 through 3/23/2014
**Location:** Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Class A amnestics administered to individuals who retained memories of the event, and all records of the event destroyed.

**Event Description:** All weights within the ██████&Son Gym assumed a red coloration for a period of five hours. All the affected weights possessed a white sticker reporting the words "**Tired of the old, boring, black weights? (T_T) ██-██ ##red|Try the red ones! (*A*) ██-██##**".
**Date of Occurrence:** 2014/██/██
**Location:** Birmingham, England, UK.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Class-B amnestics were administered to all witnesses. All weights were taken in custody for further studying. Following the event, the objects displayed no apparent anomalous effect. However, closer inspections revealed that the words "Brought to you by the Kobayashi Athletics" were inscribed on the items. All weights were replaced by new ones. The establishment is to be kept under surveillance until 2016/██/██.

**Event Description:** Two individuals were observed to spend seven hours attempting to move past each other in a narrow hallway before one collapsed from exhaustion, at which point the other decided to take a different route. There is no indication, either from recorded footage of the event or from the testimony of the involved parties, that this was intentional or involuntary.
**Date of Occurrence:** 2014/██/██
**Location:** Boston, Massachusetts office of ██████████.
**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Affected subjects were provided with appropriate medical care and amnestics were administered to all known witnesses. The hallway in question and the affected subjects have shown no anomalous properties before or since.

**Event Description:** During a public concert in the town of ██████, Georgia, a large number of //Procyon lotor// (common raccoon) assembled behind the outdoor concert stage, and started constructing an object resembling a shrine out of materials they had collected from various places around the town, including branches, pine cones, fast-food wrappers, old newspaper, and a trash-can lid. After the shrine was constructed, the raccoons proceeded to make motions described by onlookers as "bowing" to the shrine, and then quickly scattered. Upon attempted destruction of the shrine by civilian Joseph ███████, a large and aggressive nursery of raccoons emerged, numbering more than 100 by most witness accounts. The nursery proceeded to assault Joseph ███████, resulting in his death.
**Date of Occurrence:** █/██/20██
**Location:** ██████, Georgia, USA
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** All those who witnessed the event given Class-A amnestics. Death of Joseph ███████ covered up with a report of a violent mugging. Concert zone acquired by Foundation under the cover of construction. Shrine destroyed by small explosives from a safe distance under the same cover of construction. Observational post disguised as a bird sanctuary constructed. No other anomalous occurrences to date.

**Event Description:** All moths in a 5 kilometer radius of a single porch light made their way towards the light and gathered there for an hour. The moths then dispersed into the surrounding area.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** ████████, ██
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** No special actions, due to lack of witnesses at time of event. The area is to be observed for more anomalous activity until 1/1/████.

**Event Description:** A large, ten-centimeter thick layer of snow suddenly fell over the town of ██████, Massachusetts and coated the entire area. No clouds were visible at the time and despite sudden shifts in supported weight no buildings or structures were damaged.
**Date of Occurrence:** █/██/1999
**Location:** ██████, Massachusetts.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** A sample of the snow was obtained; it was found to be mundane. All residents of the town administered Class-A amnestics. As the event occurred quickly, very little video footage was captured. However, all documentation of the event has been destroyed.

**Event Description:** For a period of approximately five hours, ██████ residents of Pompano Beach, Florida and ████ non-residents working in the city, including ██ Foundation employees, experienced a shared hallucination. Interviews with those effected have provided a detailed, highly consistent account of the entire city being transported to the surface of a planet (believed to be Venus), protected by a dome of unknown design. (See Document E-41567-██ for full account.) However, telephone records, security camera feeds and interviews with non-resident non-employees suggest that nothing unusual happened during the time period and that all those affected were present on Earth and went about their business as normal.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/2011
**Location:** Pompano Beach, Florida, USA.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Affected individuals provided with amnestics after interview. Foundation personnel involved in the event have been commended for controlling media coverage. Amnestic treatment has successfully removed memories of the event. Further monitoring is counterindicated.

**Event Description:** Towards the end of a show, musician █████████████ began sweating profusely. For 6 minutes, the sweat fell to the floor and pooled together, forming into various miniature trains. Following this, the trains rapidly evaporated.
**Date of Occurrence:** 05/22/2015
**Location:** ██████, ██, USA.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Witnesses (including the musician) were administered Class-A amnestics. No further action was required, and the show was generally well received.

**Event Description:** Over an eight-minute period, six hundred and ninety-seven lightning strikes occurred within a twenty-mile wide radius around Faeto, Italy. Meteorological data shows that the locations of these strikes formed a "smiley." At the same time, all drinking water within the settlement was, according to anecdotal evidence, icy cold, scented of strawberries, and could not be boiled or otherwise heated.
**Date of Occurrence:** 2015/07/01
**Location:** Faeto, Italy.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Water supplies and meteorological data throughout Apulia to be monitored over a six-month period.

**Event Description:** Commencing at 07:31, all instances of the Basenji breed of //Canis lupus familiaris// barked constantly for one minute and forty three seconds. Commencement/cessation of barking was not linked to any external stimuli.
**Date of Occurrence:** 2015/07/03
**Location:** Australia.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Fallopia, Agent [REDACTED]'s Basenji, taken for post-anomaly testing. No anomalous activity noted since.

**Event Description:** At approximately █:26 AM local time, a train bound from █████████ to █████ (hereafter Train-A) collided with an identical train moving along the same line from █████ to █████████ (hereafter Train-B). Of the 56 casualties observed, only 28 civilians were identified. Each civilian was identified twice, with one instance riding Train-A and the other instance riding Train-B. Examination shows that all electronic and time-keeping devices present on Train-B at the time of collision were 9 hours slow. All passengers are confirmed to have been traveling on the route of Train-B 9 hours before the event, though without incident. Temporal interference has been suggested, though the cause is currently unknown and the logical paradox the situation represents has been deemed unsolvable. Whether all civilians involved caught the same train as one another twice consecutively as the result of coincidence or the effect of causal manipulation is unknown. No passengers of either train survived the impact.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/2015
**Location:** ███████████ train line, Victoria, Australia.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** All Train-B passengers were removed from the scene and taken into Foundation custody, currently kept in Site-██ cold storage. The ███████████ train line has been put under observation for further extranormal activity over a 6 month period, which is yet uneventful.

**Event Description:** Starting at 2:22 PM, all users in the ████████ chatroom ceased conversation and began to repeat the phrase "nag gimno bgaithu sa yginno alibgn yamoa gna as ahud ak" at two second intervals.  This behavior continued for two hours before ceasing.  No users seemed to recall the event, claiming that a regular conversation had occurred.  Many users claimed to have closed the chat window or left their computer during the course of the event, despite the fact that their corresponding chat handles continued to repeat the phrase throughout the event.  Users who joined the chat room while the event was underway did not participate in the event but did not type anything until after the event was finished.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/2015
**Location:** Computers around the world, most concentrated in the United States.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** All screenshots of the conversation were deleted, and the █████████ chatroom has been placed under surveillance for further anomalous behavior.

**Event Description:** For a period of approximately 3 minutes, no less than 10,000 calls were made to the number 1-800-███-████ for the [REDACTED] for ███. Records indicate that all calls came from a single number and further investigation indicates that the number is currently in use by an employee of the company who did call that day but was held up in the queue. At the 3-minute mark, all calls vanished completely from the queue.
**Date of Occurrence:** ██/██/████
**Location:** █████, ██████ ████, Philippines, calls were documented to come from the employee's address in ████, USA.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Call records for the time frame when the calls occurred were expunged from the system and false records inputted during a routine system maintenance the next day. Class-B amnestics were administered to all parties involved while the employee was monitored for the next 3 months but no anomalous activity was noted.

**Event Description:** At roughly 2:30 PM, sixteen (16) city buses pulled up to a movie theater owned by a private company; all buses were packed full. All people aboard the buses (bus drivers included) as well as the owner of the movie theater shared the same first name: "Greg". Furthermore, the Gregs' all came to the location to see the same movie, "████: ███ █████". Said movie had a Greg starring in the lead role. There was no convention of any sorts occurring at the time in the town, nor any in the world at that time that was summoning people with the name "Greg".
**Date of Occurrence:** 3/17/199█
**Location:** Greg's Theater, █████████, Pennsylvania, USA.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Interviews with all 1267 Gregs' involved as well as their families found that this had not been a planned event, and that 97% of all people involved did not know anyone else that had attended prior to the event. No records indicate that there was any advertisements or events that would have sparked such an occurrence. All Gregs' and witnesses involved were given Class-A amnestics. A cover-up story involving a Greg convention was released, and no further incident occurred after cover-up was released. Theater was monitored for two years, but aside from a reduced crime rate for the first two weeks after the event no anomalous activity occurred.
**Note:** //This was easily the most confusing case I've ever had to deal with.// -Agent Greg

**Event Description:** At 8:30 AM local time, a 911 call was made. Said call reported a construction worker had broken his neck. Ambulance arrived three minutes later, and OSWA arrived within twenty minutes. Undercover Agent ████████ was among the OSWA Workers. Investigation found that the construction helmet somehow went from a standard weight of 10 ounces/283 grams to a weight of 37 pounds/16.7 kilograms upon the worker putting it onto his head.
**Date of Occurrence:** 7/14/2005
**Location:** A construction site in New York City, New York, USA.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Item confiscated. All personal involved given Class-B amnestics. Broken neck blamed on the worker being hit by a sledge-hammer another worker dropped from the top of the building being worked on.

**Event Description:** Report of what appear to be a //Panthera tigris sondaica// (Javan tiger) sighting in a tiger enclosure in a local zoo located in Jakarta, Indonesia. The tiger appeared to be perfectly healthy, matured and was seen interacting with other tigers and zookeepers in the enclosure. Sighting happens for approximately 1 (one) hour before the tiger spontaneously disappeared. Video footage was able to confirm this.
**Date Of Occurrence:** 7/14/2015
**Location:** Jakarta, Indonesia.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** All witnesses (including zookeepers) were administered with Class-B Amnestics. Video footage and pictures regarding the sighting destroyed. A cover-up story involving a recent animal relocation have been created. Zoo monitored for future event, but no anomalous event occurred since then.
**Note:** //Panthera tigris sondaica// was officially declared extinct in 1993.

**Event Description:** At 1:23pm, for a period of approximately 10 minutes, organic sweet corn (//Zea mays// var. //saccharata//) growing on the T█████ C████ Farm began to spontaneously “pop” as if it were popcorn. According to an interview with the farm owners, the popping began and ended gradually, reaching its peak frequency around the 5-minute mark. Investigations determined that approximately 6,070 square meters (1.5 acres) of corn popped, yielding 38,035 emptied corn cobs and approximately 6,500 kg of popped corn.
**Date of Occurrence:** 09/09/2015
**Location:** ██████, Maryland.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Amnestics administered to all witnesses. Affected land was cleaned up and burned, and a cover story was implanted about faulty farm equipment sparking a fire. Popcorn and cobs were transported back to the Foundation and incinerated. Samples of popcorn, cobs, stalks, soil, and surrounding air revealed no unusual properties, and popcorn deemed safe for human consumption. Farm is to be kept under minor surveillance until 2018.
**Note:** The only type of corn usable as popcorn is //Zea mays// var. //everta//. Sweet corn kernels cannot be popped due to their soft hulls.

**Event Description:** At 4:34 PM, an unidentified man (estimated to be 56 years old) turned into wax and collapsed while riding a crowded city bus. Remains showed no anomalous properties.
**Date of Occurrence:** 10/15/2015
**Location:** Cedar Springs, Colorado, USA.
**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Remains were confiscated, and all witnesses were administered Class-A amnestics. No further action was deemed necessary.

**Event Description:** For a period of one hour, all dropped objects within the city produced an unidentified male voice imitating the expected sound.
**Date of Occurrence:** 11/24/2015
