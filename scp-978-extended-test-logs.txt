**Subject:** Dr. Clef
**Photographed Activity:** Walking away from a heated discussion with Dr. Bright.
**Photo Result:** Walking away from a heated discussion with Dr. Bright. Head was replaced with an image of a hand with a raised middle finger (as expected, given Dr. Clef's unusual properties).

The identity of the child is currently unknown.
**Addendum:** Closer analysis of the photograph reveals that structures previously believed to be shoes on the child's feet are in fact polished black cloven hooves.

**Photo Result:** [DATA EXPUNGED] a lineup of D-class personnel.
