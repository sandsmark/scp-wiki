**Special Containment Procedures:** No special containment procedures are necessary. SCP-1990-EX-01's remains are currently buried at Memorial Park Cemetery in Dalhart, Texas, United States. The computer disk containing the unfinished text of SCP-1990-EX-02 is stored in the private collection of Waco Siege survivor ████ ██████, with a digital copy of the text publicly available.

**Description:** SCP-1990-EX is the joint designation assigned to SCP-1990-EX-01 and SCP-1990-EX-02. SCP-1990-EX-01 is the deceased 33-year old Caucasian male identified as David Koresh, the messianic leader of the Branch Davidians, a Christian denomination split off from the Seventh Day Adventist Church.

SCP-1990-EX-02 is the manuscript entitled //The Decoded Message Of The Seven Seals Of The Book Of Revelation//, a theological gospel explaining the divinity of David Koresh, as written by him. SCP-1990-EX-02 was only partially completed before SCP-1990-EX-01 was terminated by █████ █████████, one of the Branch Davidian followers inside the Mount Carmel Compound.

**Discovery:** SCP-1990-EX-01 was brought to the attention of the Foundation when a Foundation operative embedded within the US Department of Defense uncovered a search warrant issued to the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms that included the involvement of the [[[groups-of-interest#toc23|Unusual Incidents Unit]]]. [[[task-forces#iota-10|Mobile Task Force Iota-10 ("Damn Feds")]]] operatives were authorized to partner with the ATF task force responsible for conducting the search warrant, forming Joint Task Force Šin-12 ("Fate Sealers"), after reports surfaced that a significant number of men, women, and children were living in Mount Carmel Center, the headquarters of SCP-1990-EX-01's followers, including a small number of people associated with the [[[groups-of-interest#toc14|Horizon Initiative]]].

Originally identified as PoI-1990-01, SCP-1990-EX-01 was designated an SCP entity after a trilateral working committee ("The Triptych Committee") was formed with representatives from the UIU and the HI. The committee members discovered their intelligence sources were all suggesting SCP-1990-EX-01 may possess reality bending abilities, possibly as a result of Incident I-1990-01, where SCP-1990-EX-01 experienced a transformative vision in Israel in 1985.[[footnote]] See //Triptych Committee Establishment Report D-1990-01// [[/footnote]]

**Preamble:** This document verifies the establishment of a trilateral working committee between The Foundation, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation Unusual Incidents Unit, and The Horizon Initiative. The US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, and The US Federal Bureau of Investigation Hostage Rescue Team are non-voting participants represented in decisions through the Unusual Incidents Unit delegation. Debriefings and interactions between members are to be done through specialized peer-to-peer networks.
-----
**Addendum:** The following information was collectively assembled from all members of the Triptych Committee during intelligence sharing discussions regarding PoI-1990-01.

Originally born under the name Vernon Howell, PoI-1990-01, publically known as the individual named David Koresh, became a member of the Branch Davidians Christian denomination in 1982. PoI-1990-01 and then-Branch Davidian Leader ████████ █████, designated PoI-1990-02, developed a rivalry that escalated into a religious schism when PoI-1990-01's followers were driven by force from Mount Carmel Center, the headquarters of the Branch Davidians, by PoI-1990-02's faction "Shepard's Rod" and forced to establish a new ministry center in Palestine, Texas.

It is strongly believed Incident I-1990-01 resulted in PoI-1990-01 developing reality-bending abilities. In 1985, while on a religious pilgrimage in Israel, PoI-1990-01 claims to have experienced a vision it interprets as a message of divine revelation. An angel supposedly appeared before PoI-1990-01 at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and proclaimed PoI-1990-01 was a descendant of the Biblical Israeli King David, and the modern-day reincarnation of the Biblical Persian King Cyrus. Most notably, PoI-1990-01 proclaims to have been informed it was the Messiah figure identified in the Book of Revelation of the Christian Holy Bible known as the "Lamb of God" who opens up the "Seven Seals" of Revelation.

PoI-1990-01 began to sway a significant number of Branch Davidian followers over to its side after the incident. In 1987, Incident I-1990-02 occurred, in which a gun battle erupted between PoI-1990-01's faction of Branch Davidians and PoI-1990-02's followers at Mount Carmel Center. Incident I-1990-03 is attributed to the grand jury trial occurring after PoI-1990-01's prosecution, where it and its followers were acquitted in the attempted manslaughter of PoI-1990-02, despite overwhelming evidence against PoI-1990-01 and its followers. In 1990, PoI-1990-01 legally changed its name in the state of California to David Koresh, "Koresh" being the Hebrew variation of the name Cyrus.

Within the Mount Carmel Compound are approximately 100 men, women, and children of various ages residing in the facility with their families. Of great concern to the Committee are the presences of former members of The Horizon Initiative, who HI claim are members who defected from their organization in the preceding months.
-----
**Summary:**  PoI-1990-01 displays characteristics similar to that of a Class 2I reality-bender[[footnote]] Subtype designation 'I' is the classification for reality benders whose facets are considered to be 'Intentional'; see //Reality Benders: Classifications and Presumed Threat Levels// for a complete definition of this classification. [[/footnote]], displaying a high magnitude of personal charisma, and the ability to subordinate masses of people into following its leadership, despite great physical or mental hardship associated with its commands. 

These events have led the committee to propose reclassifying PoI-1990-01 as a Euclid SCP Entity. The Committee requested that the Classification Committee also assign the SCP a Class 2I designation, under protocols listed in //Reality Benders: Classifications and Presumed Threat Levels//.

Signed,
**Dr. Elliot Emmerson**

*  **06/09/1992:** The US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms is notified of reports alleging SCP-1990-EX-01 and its followers are stockpiling high-capacity firearms and illegally modifying them into automatic weapons, as well as reports of narcotics manufacturing and other statutory offenses committed by SCP-1990-EX-01.

* **06/15/1992:** The ATF opens an investigation into the allegations, uncovering rumors of supernatural events related to the ministry of SCP-1990-EX-01, including claims of religious divnity and divine revelation. The Federal Bureau of Investigation Unusual Incident Unit is debriefed by an anonymous source on the ATF investigation, and the UIU proceeded with requests to join the ongoing investigation.

* **07/20/1992:** The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, with the support of the US Federal Bureau of Investigation Unusual Incidents Unit, authorized clandestine operations to ascertain more intel regarding PoI-1990-01. Special Agent ██████ █████████ infiltrates the organization and begins to provide intelligence back to the Bureau.

* **08/25/1992:** The ATF Bureau, with the support of the UIU, receive a government search warrant to investigate the Mount Carmel compound. The ATF Bureau requests assistance from the Department of Defense and Drug Enforcement Agency due to unsubstantiated reports of the Branch Davidian's operating a methamphetamine lab in the building.[[footnote]] PoI-1990-02 previously operated a methamphetamine lab inside Mount Carmel Center under his leadership of the Branch Davidians. [[/footnote]]

* **10/01/1992:** The Triptych Committee is assembled following debriefs from embedded Foundation operatives in the Department of Defence. A pre-existing cooperation agreement between the HI and Foundation is utilized to question HI representatives about the high-number of HI members inside Mount Carmel Center. HI representatives voiced support for a trilateral discussion committee to ascertain information on SCP-1990-EX-01, leading to the inclusion of the Unusual Incidents Unit.

* **02/28/1993:** The Waco Tribune-Herald published an expose of SCP-1990-EX-01, entitled "The Sinful Messiah". Fearing that operational cover could be blown, JTF Šin-12 acts on the search warrant two days in advance on February 28, 1993, under operation name "Showtime".
[[/div]]

"Operation: Showtime" quickly unraveled when an unknown gunshot prompted JTF Šin-12 agents to open fire on the compound, severely wounding SCP-1990-EX-01, and resulting in the casualties and fatalities of several civilians and JTF operatives.[[footnote]] See //JTF After Action Report D-1990-02// [[/footnote]]

**SCP Involved:** SCP-1990
**JTF Involved:**  JTF Šin-12 ("Fate Sealers")
**Incident Date:** February 28, 1993
**Incident Location:** Mount Carmel Center, Waco, Texas, United States
**Report Filer:** General William Pendergast, Deputy Director of Contingency Planning Operations
-----
**Justification:** Engagement is authorized under a federal search warrant to capture SCP-1990 and any contraband in the Branch Davidians' possession. MTF Iota-10 ("Damn Feds") is embedded with ATF federal agents under Joint Task Force Šin-12 and dispatched to the area. JTF Šin-12 operatives were on standby and awaiting clearance from Foundation Contingency Planning Operations in order to execute Operation "Showtime", the containment of SCP-1990 without jeopardizing civilians inside Mount Carmel Center. Apprehension of SCP-1990 and contraband was authorized several days in advanced due to a local newspaper article that threatened to jeopardize the mission's operational cover.

Upon arrival to Mount Carmel Center, JTF Šin-12 unexpectedly encountered armed followers of SCP-1990 occupying the facility. SCP-1990 did not appear to be armed during the initial encounter. JTF forces demanded the immediate surrender of SCP-1990 and its followers. SCP-1990 refused demands to surrender its followers' weapons, resulting in an exchange of automatic gunfire between federal agents, Foundation operatives and the Branch Davidians. SCP-1990 was observed shot in the torso during the operation, falling motionless to the ground, resulting in its followers dragging SCP-1990's body deeper in the building.
-----
**[05:00]** JTF Šin-12 operatives depart Fort Hood, Texas in a 80-vehicle convoy. 3 US Army National Guard helicopters, one of which contains MTF Ꙇ10-Comm, escort the convoy along the journey to Waco, Texas.
**[09:40]** Vehicle convoy arrives at Mount Carmel Center. Foundation and federal forces begin to secure the immediate location, before forming a human shield around the building. US National Guard helicopters fly overhead. First reports come in revealing SCP-1990's followers are armed.
**[09:45]** JTF Šin-12 operatives exchange gunfire with SCP-1990's followers using government issued automatic weapons after requests for surrender are ignored. MTF Ꙇ10-6 strikes SCP-1990 in the torso in the hail of bullets. SCP-1990 is dragged deeper into Mount Carmel Center. JTF ש-12 sustains several casualties and fatalities.
**[11:30]** A ceasefire is reached between SCP-1990's followers and federal agents. JTF operatives are told to stand down. Ammunition supplies is dangerously low for both federal and Foundation forces. A strategic retreat is made to a [[size 75%]] [REDACTED] [[/size]] perimeter around Mount Carmel Center.
----
**Addendum:** Between [09:40] and [09:45], MTF Ꙇ10-Comm and MTF Ꙇ10-3 held open radio communication during the initial exchange of gunfire. Below is the audio transcript between them. 
* **MTF Ꙇ10-Comm**: What is SCP-1990 yelling down there to ATF Commander [[size 75%]] [REDACTED] [[/size]]?

**Post-Encounter Summary:** MTF Iota-10 agents and ATF federal officers regrouped after the ceasefire, with only sporadic gunfire reports following. Of note, at 16:55 UTC, Branch Davidian member ███████ █████████ was shot dead returning to the compound by JTF operatives. At 19:30 UTC, SCP-1990 holds a phone interview with CNN, which is watched by JTF Šin-12 forces. MTF Iota-10 is ordered to hold positions at the perimeter, and transfer any information received from the JTF or FBI Hostage Rescue Team agents to the Foundation regarding SCP-1990.

Deputy Director of Contingency Planning Operations General William Pendergast authorized [[[task-forces-arc-2|Mobile Task Force Xi-3 ("Body Snatchers")]]] to be deployed to facilitate the capture of SCP-1990-EX-01, and relieve MTF Iota-10 of their duties. However, before any action was taken, an emergency vote by the Foundation's Ethics Committee resulted in a moratorium on further aggressive action in the capture or termination of SCP-1990-EX-01.

In a 6-3 vote, the Committee cited concerns over the lives of the civilians who could be further injured in the crossfire, citing the loss of life so far and issuing a fierce condemnation to the Triptych Committee on authorizing agents to fire automatic weapons into an occupied building with families and children still inside. General Pendergast ordered the MTF Iota-10 forces to stay on site and monitor the crisis alongside the federal agents, with MTF Xi-3 stationed a couple blocks away.

*  **03/03/1993:** SCP-1990-EX-01 requests a radio message to be broadcast nationwide. The Triptych Committee voices deep concern about allowing an unfiltered broadcast from SCP-1990-EX-01 to be heard publically. The Committee decides SCP-1990-EX-01's recording would be analyzed for memetic hazards before its approved for broadcast. The 57-minute radio address by SCP-1990-EX-01 is delievered. A variety of Biblical topics, including the divinity of Jesus, the Seven Seals, and the Book of Daniel are discussed.

* **03/08/1993:** FBI Hostage Rescue Team agents retrieve a video tape recording from the Branch Davidians hours after sending a video recorder into the facility. The tape contains interviews of different Branch Davidian followers inside the building, all condeming the "government narrative" that they are hostages instead of sincere religious believers staying inside on their own free will. SCP-1990-EX-01, along with several of its children, also appear on the tape, justifying their holdout as self-defense against the "army of Babylon". The Triptych Committee prevented the video from being released after a unanimous committee vote.

* **03/12/1993:** US Attorney General Janet Reno authorized a military assault on the facility by the ATF in order to bring the siege to an end. The Ethics Committee holds a vote on lifting the moratorium on the use of force, in light of the authorization, to capture or terminate SCP-1990-EX-01, including the use of anomalous means if necessary. The Ethics Committee rejects lifting the moratorium in a 5-4 vote. The Committee reasserted concerns of injuring civilians in the crossfire. However, a compromise is reached between the Ethics Committee and the Triptych Committee, whereby the authorization on the use of non-anomalous, non-violent techniques to pressure the citizens inside to leave was approved. 

* **03/20/1993:** Advanced sleep deprivation methods are utilized, including loudspeakers blasting high levels of sound at all hours of the night toward the building, and armored vehicles deployed around the perimeter in order to menace the followers of SCP-1990-EX-01 to surrender. Power and water are also disconnected from the building in another attempt to create defections.

* **04/14/1993:** SCP-1990-EX-01 offers to leave the compound with its followers if it is allowed to release what is now identified as SCP-1990-EX-02, a complete manuscript explaining the divinity of SCP-1990-EX-01 and the Seven Seals of the Book of Revelation.
[[/div]]

The Horizon Initiative, with the support of the Unusual Incidents Unit representative, indicated severe concern regarding the existence of the manuscript to the Committee, eventually leading to a vote on designating SCP-1990-EX-02 as an anomalous object.[[footnote]] See //Horizon Initiative's Letter To The Triptych Committee Regarding The Seven Seals: D-1990-03// [[/footnote]]

To: Members of the Triptych Committee
From: Leader of the Sons of Shammai

The Horizon Initiative will always stand by and defend by the principles of our faiths. Our hearts and minds were moved by the work of the Foundation in bringing our divergent organizations together to combat the Heretic who occupies the false Mount Carmel along with his blind followers.

When we were informed that some of our own brothers were swayed by his deceptions, we knew that some unholy forces must be at work. These members who turned their backs on the Initiative were from all the branches of the tree, yet all whom we managed to speak to, all proclaimed the Heretic as their Messiah.

To hear my own say such words set a fire within me, and by the grace of G-d, the [[size 95%]] LORD [[/size]] compelled your secularist organizations to aid in the rectification of the sins spread by the Heretic. We have shared our knowledge with all of you regarding him, the man who is neither related to the Holy King David or the great Koresh, from our lost brothers who revealed to us his doctrine known as The Serpent's Root, and the occult vision he experienced in the Holy Land.

The historical record assembled at the first meeting clarifies the nature of the Heretic, yet throughout this crisis, an uneasy feeling began to make itself known to our representatives, even myself. The CNN interview, the radio recording, and the video tape, all from the Heretic spoke not like the tongue of a misguided fool, but of a theologian who knows the words and meanings of our different Biblical sources, and crafted from it a twisted interpretation. We indicated our concern that SCP-1990-01 was constantly referencing various lines of scripture where people rejected the "message" of Jesus Christ, a clear indication to us all that SCP-1990-01's was perceiving its own "message" is also being rejected. 

The Book of Revelation is one of the many writings that our theologians have studied over the years, including the Seven Seal featured in John's vision. The Heretic announced he was to publish to the world his interpretation of the Seven Seals to the non-believers of the world. The Initiative fears given the nature of the Heretic's powers, it is very possible he intends to break these seals.

The Seven Seals are those that bind a divine scroll which John recollects in his narrative. The opening of every seal on the scroll unleashes an apocalyptic event upon the world. The seals can only be broken by the Lion of Judah, the Lamb with Seven Horns and Seven Eyes, who is from the Root of David.

Upon opening the first Four Seals, the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse are to appear. The Fifth Seal unleashes the cries and testimonies of the martyrs of Christianity, who are all given white robes. The Sixth Seal unleashes a series of apocalyptic events on Earth, known together as the Wrath of God, with earthquakes shifting mountains and islands from their place, and the Sun becoming Black, and the Moon as Red as Blood, and the Heavens are departed. The Seventh Seal causes Seven Angels to play Seven Trumpet Horns, all difficult tribulations that mankind must undergo as part of John's vision.

Our Christian theologians interpret these events to be started by Jesus Christ, who is also mentioned later in other chapters of the Book. You can understand our concern when the Heretic claims he is the one who is supposed to break the Seals. While we do not believe he will actually unleash the Biblical Seven Seals, too many times we have seen deceivers unleash supernatural harm upon mankind before.

Despite a long history of the Protestant United States fostering self-proclaimed Messiah figures, at no point in recent history did one cause a military standoff from their beliefs. Throughout the Heretic's ministry, he kept proclaiming that the Army of Babylon would put an end to his preaching. Now we stare at our TVs in disbelief as the secular army of the United States is fulfilling this very same prophecy. This encapsulates the danger of reality benders who know sacred Scripture.

The Foundation representatives notified the Ethics Committee of the new developments and further requested a lifting of the moratorium. The moratorium on the use of force against SCP-1990-EX-01 was unexpectedly lifted hours later on the executive orders of the O5-4 Councilmember, and MTFs were authorized to siege the compound alongside the ATF. The Foundation was given the greenlight to deploy Class-A aerosol anesthetics in the operation in the event SCP-1990-EX-02 was written by the time MTF operatives arrived.

----
Justification for Overwatch intervention is approved under **Foundation Protocol █████-██**, authorizing preemption of lower committee decisions when O5 Councilmembers determine circumstances which require suspending traditional rules of deference to administrative bodies in order to restore operational capacity.

Upon notification from Foundation representatives on the Triptych Committee about requesting a lift on the Ethics Committee's moratorium dealing with SCP-1990, the Triptych Committee shall be granted full authorization on the use of force in retrieving and containing SCP-1990.

**Mobile Task Force Iota-10 ("Damn Feds") and Mobile Task Force Xi-3 ("Body Snatchers") are hereby granted authority to engage in covert operations in the containment of SCP-1990**, under the command of General Pendergast within JTF Šin-12 ("Fate Sealers").

The continued delay of authorizing aggressive tactics against SCP-1990 have jeopardized Foundation capabilities in both diplomatic discussions on the Triptych Committee with GoI representatives as well as combat abilities in tactical decision making.

The "Waco Siege" has lasted significantly longer than necessary. **The Foundation must always limit civilian casualties in its operations, but the Foundation also must not disregard containment objectives if collateral damages are merely present.**

* Branch Davidian member ████ ██████ flees from the building holding a computer disk in her hand. MTF Iota-10 operatives apprehend her and confiscate the computer disk, which is later revealed to be the incomplete SCP-1990-EX-02 manuscript.

* MTF Xi-3 ("Body Snatchers") are deployed to retrieve and contain SCP-1990-EX-01, due to fears the fire was created anomalously by SCP-1990-EX-01.

|| **Subject:** || Re: Waco Siege ||
|||| _
 This should be the final MTF After-Action Report filed under my authority with regards to The Waco Siege. Unlike MTF Iota-10's initial attempt on capturing SCP-1990-01, MTF Xi-3 did not encounter the same level of obstacles in retrieving the corpse of SCP-1990-01. However, I feel obliged to provide a final statement regarding my temporary command of MTF units in this operation and my requests moving forward. _
 _
When an M728 Combat Vehicle punctured an opening into Mount Carmel Center for MTF Xi-3, the fire had already started inside the building, filling the corridors inside with heavy smoke. MTF Xi-3 forces were equipped with gas masks to prevent inhalation from the Class A aerosol anesthetics and tear gas mixture being pumped in the facility. MTF operatives discovered what we now determined is a Flite-Rite CS gas grenade. We are currently unsure if the Branch Davidians previously owned a stockpile of these particular grenades or if federal forces had used the grenades in the prior hours before MTF operatives infiltrated the building. _
 _
MTF Xi-3 were given specific directives to retrieve only SCP-1990-01 and other anomalous items discovered if applicable. We now know that a couple operatives did encounter a door which we later found out lead to the bunker room containing the unconscious bodies of a majority of the 75 civilians residing in the building, but the operatives did not open the door due to locating the body of SCP-1990-01 first. The aforementioned body was discovered alongside another Branch Davidian follower, both killed by a handgun found on side. We now know through follow-up reports that this individual was a member of the Horizon Initiative identified as █████ █████████, PoI-1990-03. _
 _
The Waco Siege unfortunately did not proceed in the way that I expect Foundation operations to be conducted, considering the multiple powerful stakeholders involved, and the high levels of civilian fatalities that resulted afterwards. It has become clear under my command that our operational integrity was compromised by faulty intelligence, overreliance on federal authority for first action, and the moratorium issued right after MTF Iota-10's failed mission. _
 _
Contingency planning requires the full use of all available Foundation resources in a given situation in order to limit worst case scenarios from containment failures to containment breaches, and everything in-between. MTF units waited alongside federal forces for weeks on end waiting for approval to capture SCP-1990. My authority was derived from Triptych Committee recommendations, yet I found myself unable to direct orders to commanders because of the moratorium. _
 _
In summary, I commend the excellent MTF operatives who put their lives on the line in order to contain SCP-1990 for the Foundation. I only wish I could have done more to prevent not only civilian casualties, but the death of our own operatives. It is not impossible to imagine a situation where we are dealing with a significantly more dangerous SCP and also being strung up by bureaucratic infighting. Therefore I only request that you reach out once again to the appropriate administrative bodies and strongly remind them that their incompetence risks our entire Foundation mission, just like it did with this siege. _

* Several more explosions occur before the building collapses. The charred remains of 75 bodies belonging to Branch Davidian members killed in the fire are discovered scattered amongst the rubble of Mount Carmel Center. Cover story CS-1990-01 is implemented, with news media being informed that the body of SCP-1990-EX-01 was found on site in the aftermath of the siege.

* **04/20/1993:** The body of SCP-1990-EX-01 is transported from Waco, Texas to Foundation Facility Site 17.  The body undergoes a full autopsy under the direction of Dr. Rodney Gerald to discover any anomalous prorties within SCP-1990-EX-01. Results reveal SCP-1990-EX-01's body is identical to that of a non-anomalous human, including SCP-1990-EX-01's gunshot wound was severe yet is possible for a human to survive the effects of.

* **04/24/1993:** The incomplete texts of SCP-1990-EX-02 are carefully investigated for embedded memetic hazards It is discovered the text only contains the explaination of the First Seal out of the Seven Seas of the Book of Revelation. A concluding report reveals no cognitohazards or memetic effects are present in the text.

* **04/26/1993:** After recieving the autopsy report and manuscript review, The Ethics Committee authorizes an investigation analyzing the complete account of all events preceding and following Incident I-1990-04. A final report is recieved by the Ethics Committee, who vote to approve the findings, and distribute the report in advance to the Triptych Committee.

* **05/27/1993:** The Triptych Committee and JTF Šin-12 ("Fate Sealers") are disbanded by a unanimous vote of all committee representatives at the final meeting.

The Ethics Committee investigation determined that there was a total absence of any anomalous activity throughout the entire investigation, with all reports of supposed anomalous phenomena attributable to SCP-1990-EX as being the result of deeply-held religious convictions on the part of the Branch Davidians in siding with their denomination leader, and rampant speculation from authorities and GoI representatives on the Triptych Committee. The Ethics Committee reprimanded Foundation members on the Committee for deferring to the other GoIs without sufficient oversight of their data.

The Ethics Committee condemned both the Horizon Initiative and the Unusual Incidents Unit for their "overzealous" desire to see SCP-1990-EX-01 and SCP-1990-EX-02 contained without any evidence of their anomalous traits and "jeopardizing" the lives of civilians who perished in the Waco Siege. The Committee concluded that the UIU, like the ATF, was under public and internal pressure to justify its existence, and a successful arrest and capture of SCP-1990-EX-01 would have boosted the credibility and prestige of both organizations.

The Ethics Committee voted to classify SCP-1990-EX as an Explained phenomenon, and requested SCP-1990-EX-02 texts to be publicly released. The Recordkeeping and Information Security Administration signed off on the Ethics Committee's request in coordination with the approval of SCP-1990-EX-01's legal representation.[[footnote]] ████ ███████, the former lawyer of SCP-1990-01, authorized the public release of a manuscript reproduction created by Dr. ██████ ██████, and Dr. █████ █████, with assistance from Waco Siege survivor ████ ██████.

= __ACCOUNT SUMMARY: SCP-1990__
-----
The SCP Foundation Ethics Committee is tasked with upholding the values and mission statement of our organization. When situations call for potential civilian casualties in the course of an operation, we are the ones who are tasked with deciding whether or not that operation can be approved. We are the ones who balance the moral costs of everything the Foundation does. These responsibilities weigh on each committee member every time we convene for deliberations.

In the aftermath of Incident I-1990-04, the "Waco Siege", the Ethics Committee was facing substantial criticism from within the Foundation over our previous votes on issuing a moratorium on the use of force in capturing SCP-1990-01. The high number of civilians, including families and children, made nearly all of us agree that aggressive force should be delayed until better options are presented. When it was discovered MTF operatives and federal forces fired rounds of ammunition into the building, we were all offended by the news, even more so when we later discovered civilians were injured in the crossfire.

Nevertheless, again we were requested to lift our mortarium, and our committee became more divided between those who felt confident that the Foundation should have the authority to bring the situation to an end, and those who were still skeptical about reversing our decision when no immediate danger to the civilians inside was presenting a call for swift action. We were once again perplexed at how ATF forces conducted their "non-aggressive" tactics to drive out the Branch Davidians. Blaring loud sounds and music at all hours of the night, and rolling up military vehicles on US civilians are the actions of what we expect from 3rd world despots, not from the traditional picture of the US Government.

Finally, the O5-4 Councilmember lifted our mortarium under Foundation protocols calling for superseding administrative bodies' decisions if the actions were fundamentally undermining operational capacity. We strongly disagree with that interpretation, and we have requested a full Overwatch Council meeting to clarify the circumstances under which that protocol may be invoked in the future.

As it turns out, neither SCP-1990-01 or SCP-1990-02 displayed anomalous properties. In fact, nowhere throughout the entire Waco Siege was there a credible anomalous event reported. The documents within this report will confirm these statements. The Foundation ultimately engaged in a violent and protracted containment standoff for non-anomalous objects. There was no oversight of GoIs' intelligence reports regarding SCP-1990, and rampant speculation escalated what should have been a standard capture and extraction mission into a spectacle. The only individuals who benefitted from this operation are the members of the same organization that had brought SCP-1990 to our attention in the first place: The Horizon Initiative.

The Ethics Committee hereby votes to request a reclassification of SCP-1990 as an Explained phenomenon by the Classification Committee, and also requests SCP-1990-02 texts be publicly released by the Recordkeeping and Information Security Administration. The Committee also votes to reprimand all Foundation representatives on the Triptych Committee through a note on their personnel files.[[footnote]] This request was later denied by the O5-4 Councilmember.
