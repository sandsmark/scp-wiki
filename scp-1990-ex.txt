**Special Containment Procedures:** No special containment procedures are necessary. SCP-1990-EX-01's remains are currently buried at Memorial Park Cemetery in Dalhart, Texas, United States. The computer disk containing the unfinished text of SCP-1990-EX-02 is stored in the private collection of Waco Siege survivor ████ ██████, with a digital copy of the text publicly available.

**Description:** SCP-1990-EX is the joint designation assigned to SCP-1990-EX-01 and SCP-1990-EX-02. SCP-1990-EX-01 is the deceased 33-year old Caucasian male identified as David Koresh, the messianic leader of the Branch Davidians, a Protestant Christian denomination split-off from the Seventh-day Adventist Church.

SCP-1990-EX-02 is the manuscript entitled //The Decoded Message Of The Seven Seals Of The Book Of Revelation//, a theological gospel explaining the divinity of David Koresh, as written by him. SCP-1990-EX-02 was only partially completed before SCP-1990-EX-01 was terminated by █████ █████████, one of the Branch Davidian followers inside the Mount Carmel Compound.

**Discovery:** SCP-1990-EX-01 was brought to the attention of the Foundation when an undercover operative embedded within the US Department of Defense uncovered a search warrant issued to the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms which included the involvement of the [[[unusual-incidents-unit-hub|Unusual Incidents Unit]]]. [[[task-forces#iota-10|Mobile Task Force Iota-10 ("Damn Feds")]]] operatives were authorized to partner with the ATF task force responsible for conducting the search warrant, forming Joint Task Force Šin-12 ("Fate Sealers"), after reports surfaced that a significant number of men, women, and children were living inside Mount Carmel Center, the headquarters of SCP-1990-EX-01's followers, including a number of people associated with the [[[horizon-initiative-hub|Horizon Initiative]]].

Originally identified as PoI-1990-01, SCP-1990-EX-01 was designated an SCP entity after a trilateral working committee ("The Triptych Committee") was formed with representatives from the UIU and the HI. The committee members identified several speculative intelligence sources suggesting SCP-1990-EX-01 may possess reality bending abilities, possibly as a result of Incident I-1990-01, where SCP-1990-EX-01 experienced a supernatural vision at Mount Zion in Israel in 1985.[[footnote]] See //Triptych Committee Establishment Report D-1990-01// [[/footnote]]

**Preamble:** This document verifies the establishment of a trilateral working committee between The Foundation, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation Unusual Incidents Unit, and The Horizon Initiative. The US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, and The US Federal Bureau of Investigation Hostage Rescue Team are non-voting participants represented in decisions through the Unusual Incidents Unit delegation. Debriefings and interactions between members are to be done through specialized peer-to-peer networks.
-----
**Addendum:** The following information was assembled from committee members during intelligence-sharing discussions regarding PoI-1990-01.

Originally born under the name Vernon Howell, PoI-1990-01, known publicly as David Koresh, became a member of the Branch Davidians Christian denomination in 1982. It is strongly believed Incident I-1990-01 resulted in PoI-1990-01 developing reality-bending abilities.

In 1985, while undergoing a religious pilgrimage in Israel, PoI-1990-01 claims to have experienced a supernatural vision it interpreted as divine revelation. While standing atop Mount Zion, PoI-1990-01 claimed to have been approached by "seven angelic beings" from the sky who imparted onto him the knowledge of the "Seven Seals" of the Book of Revelation of the Christian Holy Bible. PoI-1990-01 afterwards claimed to be a descendant of the Israeli King David, and the modern-day reincarnation of the Persian King Cyrus.

PoI-1990-01 began to sway a significant number of religious followers over to its side after the incident. At this time, the Branch Davidian leadership was being led by another prophetic figure named  ████████ █████, designated PoI-1990-02. In 1987, Incident I-1990-02 occurred, in which a gun battle erupted between PoI-1990-01's faction of Branch Davidians and PoI-1990-02's followers at Mount Carmel Center.

Incident I-1990-03 is attributed to the grand jury trial occurring after PoI-1990-01's prosecution, where it and its followers were acquitted in the attempted manslaughter of PoI-1990-02, despite overwhelming evidence against PoI-1990-01 and its followers. In 1990, PoI-1990-01 legally changed its name in the state of California to David Koresh, "Koresh" being the Hebrew variation of the name Cyrus.

Residing within the Mount Carmel Center compound are approximately 100 men, women, and children of various ages with their families. Of equal concern to the committee is the presence of several former members of The Horizon Initiative, who HI representatives claim are members who unexpectedly defected from their organization in the preceding months.
-----
**Summary:**  PoI-1990-01 displays characteristics similar to that of a Class 2I reality-bender[[footnote]] Subtype designation 'I' is the classification for reality benders whose facets are considered to be 'Intentional'; see //Reality Benders: Classifications and Presumed Threat Levels// for a complete definition of this classification. [[/footnote]], displaying a high magnitude of personal charisma, and the ability to subordinate masses of people into following its leadership, despite great physical or mental hardship associated with its commands.

These events have led the committee to propose reclassifying PoI-1990-01 as a Euclid SCP Entity. The Committee requested that the Classification Committee also assign now-SCP-1990 a Class 2I designation, under protocols listed in //Reality Benders: Classifications and Presumed Threat Levels//.

Signed,

*  **06/09/1992:** The US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms is notified of reports alleging SCP-1990-EX-01 and its followers are stockpiling high-capacity firearms and illegally modifying them into automatic weapons, as well as reports of narcotics manufacturing and other statutory offenses being committed by SCP-1990-EX-01.

* **06/15/1992:** The ATF opens an investigation into the allegations, uncovering rumors of supernatural events related to the ministry of SCP-1990-EX-01, including claims of religious divinity and divine revelation. The Federal Bureau of Investigation Unusual Incident Unit is debriefed by an anonymous source on the ATF investigation, and the UIU proceeded with requests to join the ongoing investigation.

* **07/20/1992:** The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, with the support of the US Federal Bureau of Investigation Unusual Incidents Unit, authorizes clandestine operations to ascertain more intel regarding PoI-1990-01. ATF Special Agent ██████ █████████ infiltrates the organization and begins to provide intelligence back to the Bureau.

* **08/25/1992:** The ATF Bureau, with the support of the UIU, receive a government search warrant to investigate the Mount Carmel Center compound. The ATF Bureau requests assistance from the Department of Defense and Drug Enforcement Agency due to unsubstantiated reports of the Branch Davidian's operating a methamphetamine lab in the building. Undercover operatives in the Department of Defense notify the Foundation. [[footnote]] PoI-1990-02 previously operated a methamphetamine lab inside Mount Carmel Center under his leadership of the Branch Davidians. [[/footnote]]

* **10/01/1992:** The Triptych Committee is assembled following several days of inter-agency communication between the Foundation and official contacts with the UIU and the HI. The HI representatives indicated concern regarding SCP-1990-EX-01, proposing a trilateral discussion committee to ascertain further information on SCP-1990-EX-01.

* The Unusual Incidents Unit was initially uncooperative with Foundation messengers before acquiescing after being offered direct control over ATF and FBI delegates at official meetings.

* **02/28/1993:** The Waco Tribune-Herald publishes an expose of SCP-1990-EX-01, entitled "The Sinful Messiah". Fearing that operational cover could be blown, JTF Šin-12 acts on the search warrant two days in advance under operation name "Showtime".
[[/div]]
[[div style="text-align: justify;"]]
"Operation: Showtime" quickly unraveled when an unknown gunshot prompted JTF Šin-12 agents to open fire on the compound, severely wounding SCP-1990-EX-01, and resulting in the casualties and fatalities of several civilians and JTF operatives.[[footnote]] See //JTF After Action Report D-1990-02// [[/footnote]] [[/div]]

**SCP Involved:** SCP-1990
**JTF Involved:**  JTF Šin-12 ("Fate Sealers")
**Incident Date:** February 28, 1993
**Incident Location:** Mount Carmel Center, Waco, Texas, United States
**Report Filer:** General William Pendergast, Deputy Director of Contingency Planning Operations
-----
**Justification:** Engagement is authorized under a federal search warrant to capture SCP-1990 and any contraband in the Branch Davidians' possession. MTF Iota-10 ("Damn Feds") are embedded with ATF federal agents under Joint Task Force Šin-12 and dispatched to the area. JTF Šin-12 operatives were on standby and awaiting clearance from Foundation Contingency Planning Operations in order to execute Operation "Showtime" - the containment of SCP-1990 without jeopardizing civilians inside Mount Carmel Center. Apprehension of SCP-1990 and contraband was authorized several days in advanced due to a local newspaper article that threatened to jeopardize the mission's operational cover.

Upon arrival to Mount Carmel Center, JTF Šin-12 unexpectedly encountered armed followers of SCP-1990 occupying the facility. SCP-1990 did not appear to be armed during the initial encounter. JTF forces demanded the immediate surrender of SCP-1990 and its followers. SCP-1990 refused demands to surrender its followers' weapons, resulting in an exchange of automatic gunfire between federal agents, Foundation operatives and the Branch Davidians. SCP-1990 was observed shot in the torso during the operation, falling motionless to the ground, resulting in its followers dragging SCP-1990's body into the building.
-----
**[05:00]** JTF Šin-12 operatives depart Fort Hood, Texas in a 80-vehicle convoy. 3 US Army National Guard helicopters, one of which contains JTF Comm, escort the convoy along the journey to Waco, Texas.
**[09:40]** Vehicle convoy arrives at Mount Carmel Center. Foundation and federal forces begin to secure the immediate location, before forming a human shield around the building. US National Guard helicopters fly overhead. First reports come in revealing SCP-1990's followers are armed.
**[09:45]** JTF Šin-12 operatives exchange gunfire with SCP-1990's followers using government issued automatic weapons after requests for surrender are ignored. Unidentified JTF Agent strikes SCP-1990 in the torso in the hail of bullets. SCP-1990 is dragged deeper into Mount Carmel Center.
**[11:30]** A ceasefire is reached between SCP-1990's followers and federal agents. JTF operatives are told to stand down. Ammunition supplies is dangerously low for both federal and Foundation forces.
----
**Addendum:** Of note, at 16:55 UTC, Branch Davidian member ███████ █████████ was shot dead returning to the compound by JTF operatives misidentifying them as an assailant. At 19:30 UTC, SCP-1990 holds a phone interview with CNN, which is watched by JTF Šin-12 forces.

Deputy Director of Contingency Planning Operations General William Pendergast authorized [[[task-forces-arc-2|Mobile Task Force Xi-3 ("Body Snatchers")]]] to be deployed to facilitate the capture of SCP-1990-EX-01. However, before any action was taken, an emergency vote by the Foundation's Ethics Committee resulted in a moratorium on further aggressive action in the capture or termination of SCP-1990-EX-01.

In a 6-3 vote, the Committee cited concerns over potential civilian casualties, citing the fatalities so far incurred in the operation, and issuing a fierce condemnation to General William Pendergast on authorizing agents to open fire with their automatic weapons into an occupied building with families still inside.

* **03/08/1993:** FBI Hostage Rescue Team agents retrieve a video tape recording from the Branch Davidians hours after sending a video recorder into the facility. The tape contains interviews of different Branch Davidian followers inside the building, all condemning the "government narrative" that they are hostages, instead of sincere religious believers staying inside on their own free will.

* SCP-1990-EX-01, along with several of its children, also appear on the tape, justifying their holdout as self-defense against the "army of Babylon". The Triptych Committee votes to prevent the video from being released.

* **03/12/1993:** US Attorney General Janet Reno authorizes a military assault on the facility by the ATF in order to bring the siege to an end. The Ethics Committee rejects lifting their moratorium in a 5-4 vote. The Committee reasserts concerns of injuring civilians in the operation. A compromise ruling is made, which results in the authorization of non-anomalous, non-violent techniques to pressure civilians inside to leave the building.

* **03/20/1993:** ATF Forces deploy advanced sleep deprivation methods in order to frighten or menace the followers of SCP-1990-EX-01 to surrender. Of note were the placement of several loudspeakers blaring high decibel levels of sound towards the building at night and deploying heavy combat armored vehicles around the building's perimeter. Power and water are also disconnected from the building in another attempt to create defections.

* **04/14/1993:** SCP-1990-EX-01 offers to leave the compound with its followers if it is allowed to release what is now identified as SCP-1990-EX-02, a complete manuscript explaining the divinity of SCP-1990-EX-01 and the Seven Seals of the Book of Revelation.
[[/div]]
[[div style="text-align: justify;"]]
The Horizon Initiative, with the support of the Unusual Incidents Unit representative, indicated severe concern regarding the existence of the manuscript to the committee, eventually leading to a vote on designating SCP-1990-EX-02 as an anomalous object.[[footnote]] See //Horizon Initiative's Letter To The Triptych Committee Regarding The Seven Seals: D-1990-03// [[/footnote]]

To: Members of the Triptych Committee
From: Leader of the Sons of Shammai

The Horizon Initiative will always stand by and defend the principles of our religions. Our hearts and minds were moved by the work of the [[size 95%]] LORD [[/size]] in bringing our divergent organizations together to combat the Heretic who occupies the false Mount Carmel along with his blind followers.

When the Initiative was informed that some of our own brothers were being swayed by his deceptions, we knew that some unholy forces must be testing our convictions. The members who turned their backs on the Initiative were from all the branches of the Abrahamic faith, yet all proclaimed the Heretic as the divine Messiah.

To hear my own //bet-knesset//'s sons say such words set a fire within me, and by the grace of G-d, the [[size 95%]] LORD [[/size]] will make him atone for his heresies, and his sins shall be rectified. We have shared our knowledge with your secular organizations regarding him, this man who is neither from the tree of Holy King David nor the Great Koresh.

An uneasy presence has been haunting me since I first encountered the words of the Heretic, and I am not alone. The entire Initiative has been shaken by these events. The Heretic speaks not with the tongue of a misguided or deceptive fool but a powerful and dangerous theologian unrivaled in our history. His Gnostic vision on Mount Zion and the nature of his mystical abilities only awaken us to the risk of inaction against this false prophet.

Despite a long history of the Protestant United States fostering self-proclaimed Messiah figures, none have ever invoked a military standoff of such scale and ferocity as to be seen around the world. We do not know what will happen if he finishes his interpretation of the Seven Seals of Revelation. We only fear with every day of inaction, we come another second closer to fulfilling this Heretic's vision of an apocalypse.

----
Justification for Overwatch intervention is approved under **Foundation Protocol █████-██**, authorizing preemption of lower committee decisions when O5 Council Members ascertain circumstances which require suspending traditional rules of deference to administrative bodies in order to restore operational capacity.

**Mobile Task Force Iota-10 ("Damn Feds") and Mobile Task Force Xi-3 ("Body Snatchers") are hereby granted authority to engage in covert operations in the containment of SCP-1990**, under the command of General Pendergast within JTF Šin-12 ("Fate Sealers").

Upon notification from the Foundation delegation on the Triptych Committee about requesting a lift on the Ethics Committee's moratorium on capturing SCP-1990, the Triptych Committee shall be granted full authorization on the use of force in retrieving and containing SCP-1990-01 and SCP-1990-02.

The continued delay of authorizing aggressive tactics against SCP-1990-01 have jeopardized Foundation capabilities in both diplomatic discussions with GoI representatives, as well as operational combat abilities for tactical decision-making, resulting in the current protracted standoff.

SCP-1990-01 reality-bending abilities are currently not fully understood, meaning any further delay in its containment risks escalating the situational threat level to a potential **CK-Class Restructuring Scenario** if SCP-1990-02 is completed.

* Branch Davidian member ████ ██████ flees from the building holding a computer disk in their hand. MTF Iota-10 operatives apprehend them and confiscate the computer disk, which is later revealed to be the incomplete SCP-1990-EX-02 manuscript.

* MTF Xi-3 ("Body Snatchers") are deployed to retrieve and contain SCP-1990-EX-01, due to fears the fire was being created anomalously by SCP-1990-EX-01. A large explosion occurs inside the facility, coinciding with the withdrawal of MTF Xi-3 operatives and the body of SCP-1990-EX-01.[[footnote]] See //MTF After-Action Report Cover Letter D-1990-05// [[/footnote]]

* Several more explosions occur before the building collapses. The charred remains of 75 bodies belonging to Branch Davidian members killed in the fire are discovered scattered amongst the rubble of Mount Carmel Center. Cover story CS-1990-01 is implemented, with news media being informed that the body of SCP-1990-EX-01 was found on site in the aftermath of the siege.

* **04/20/1993:** The body of SCP-1990-EX-01 is transported from Waco, Texas to Foundation Facility Site 17.  The body undergoes a full autopsy under the direction of Dr. Rodney Gerald to discover any anomalous properties within SCP-1990-EX-01. Results reveal SCP-1990-EX-01's body is identical to that of a non-anomalous human.

* **04/24/1993:** The incomplete texts of SCP-1990-EX-02 are carefully investigated for embedded memetic hazards. After a thorough investigation, it is discovered the text only contains the explanation of the First Seal out of the Seven Seals of the Book of Revelation. The review concludes no cognitohazards or memetic effects are present in the text.

* **04/26/1993:** After receiving the autopsy report and manuscript review, The Ethics Committee authorizes an internal investigation analyzing the complete account of all events preceding and following Incident I-1990-04. A complete summary is received by the Ethics Committee, who vote to approve the findings and conclusions presented within.

* **05/27/1993:** The Triptych Committee and JTF Šin-12 ("Fate Sealers") are disbanded by a unanimous vote of all committee representatives at the final meeting.

This should be the final MTF After-Action Report filed under my authority with regards to Incident I-1990-04. Unlike the initial JTF Šin-12 mission to capture SCP-1990-01, MTF Xi-3 did not encounter the same level of obstacles in retrieving the corpse of SCP-1990-01. However, I feel obliged to provide a final statement regarding my temporary command of MTF units in this operation and my requests moving forward. _
 _
When an M728 Combat Vehicle punctured an opening into Mount Carmel Center for MTF Xi-3, the fire had already started inside the building, filling the corridors inside with heavy smoke. MTF Xi-3 forces were equipped with gas masks to prevent inhalation from the Class A aerosol anesthetics and tear gas mixture being pumped in the facility. MTF operatives discovered what we now determined is a Flite-Rite CS gas grenade on the floor. We are currently unsure if the Branch Davidians previously owned a stockpile of these particular grenades, or if federal forces had used the grenades in the prior hours before MTF operatives infiltrated the building. _
 _
MTF Xi-3 were given specific directives to retrieve only SCP-1990-01 and other anomalous items discovered if applicable. The aforementioned body was discovered alongside another Branch Davidian follower, both killed by a handgun found on side. We now know through follow-up reports that this individual was a member of the Horizon Initiative identified as █████ █████████, PoI-1990-03. _
 _
It has become clear under my command that our operational integrity was compromised by faulty intelligence, over-reliance on federal authority for first action, and the moratorium issued right after JTF Šin-12's failed mission. Contingency planning requires the full use of all available Foundation resources in a given situation in order to limit worst-case scenarios from containment failures to containment breaches, and everything in-between. However, in this situation, I found myself unable to direct orders to operatives because of the moratorium. _
 _
I commend the excellent MTF operatives who put their lives on the line in order to contain SCP-1990 for the Foundation. I only wish I could have done more to prevent not only civilian casualties, but the deaths of our own operatives in the standoff. It is not impossible to imagine another situation where we are dealing with a significantly more dangerous SCP, yet we are strung-up by bureaucratic infighting within the Foundation. Therefore I only request that you reach out to the appropriate administrative bodies and strongly remind them that their incompetence risks our entire Foundation mission, just like it did with this siege. _

The Ethics Committee report determined that there was a total absence of any anomalous activity throughout the entire investigation, with all documentation of supposed anomalous phenomena attributable to SCP-1990-EX either being the result of deeply-held religious convictions on the part of the Branch Davidians in siding with their denomination leader, or rampant speculation from government authorities and GoI representatives regarding the abilities of SCP-1990-EX-01.

The Ethics Committee condemned both the Horizon Initiative and the Unusual Incidents Unit for their "overzealous" desire to see SCP-1990-EX-01 and SCP-1990-EX-02 contained without any evidence of their anomalous traits and "jeopardizing" the lives of civilians who perished in the Waco Siege. The Committee concluded that the UIU, like the ATF, was under public and internal pressure to justify its existence, and a successful arrest and capture of SCP-1990-EX-01 would have boosted the credibility and prestige of both organizations.

The Ethics Committee voted to classify SCP-1990-EX as an Explained phenomenon, and requested SCP-1990-EX-02 texts be publicly released. The Recordkeeping and Information Security Administration signed off on the Ethics Committee's request in coordination with the approval of SCP-1990-EX-01's legal representation.[[footnote]] ████ ███████, the former lawyer of SCP-1990-01, authorized the public release of a manuscript reproduction created by Dr. ██████ ██████, and Dr. █████ █████, with assistance from Waco Siege survivor ████ ██████.

The SCP Foundation Ethics Committee is tasked with upholding the values and mission objectives of our organization. When situations pose a risk of inflicting civilian casualties in the course of an operation, we are the ones who are tasked with deciding whether or not that operation can be approved. We are the ones who balance the moral costs of everything the Foundation does, and will do. These responsibilities weigh on each committee member every time we convene for deliberations.

In the aftermath of Incident I-1990-04, the "Waco Siege", the Ethics Committee was facing substantial criticism from within the Foundation over our previous votes on issuing a moratorium on the use of force in capturing SCP-1990-01, and reaffirming the moratorium after the discovery of SCP-1990-02.

The high number of combat fatalities which occurred after JTF agents failed to storm the compound prompted this body to intervene in order to avoid further collateral damage. A majority of us agreed that aggressive force should be delayed until better options were presented. Only after US Attorney General Janet Reno approved the use of aggressive military tactics was there any official request by Foundation delegates to remove the moratorium.

Our committee was divided between those who felt confident that the Foundation should have the authority to bring the situation to an end, and those who were still skeptical about reversing our decision when no immediate danger to the civilians inside was presenting a call for swift action. I contemplated my own vote for hours, fully aware of the dangers of inaction, but equally prescient of the dangers of an over-reaction.

Eventually, the O5-4 Council Member lifted our moratorium under Foundation protocols calling for superseding administrative bodies' decisions if the actions were fundamentally undermining operational capacity. We strongly disagreed with that interpretation at the time it was issued, and we now have requested a full Overwatch Council meeting to clarify the circumstances under which that protocol may be invoked in the future.

As it turns out in the end, neither SCP-1990-01 or SCP-1990-02 displayed any anomalous properties. In fact, nowhere throughout the entire Waco Siege was there a credible anomalous event reported. There was no oversight of GoIs' intelligence reports regarding SCP-1990, and rampant speculation escalated what should have been a standard capture-and-extraction mission into a media spectacle.

The Foundation ultimately engaged in a violent and protracted containment standoff for non-anomalous objects. The only individuals who benefited from this operation are the members of the same organization that had members embedded alongside SCP-1990 in the first place: The Horizon Initiative.

//The Foundation has fallen short of its mission, letting self-serving impulses guide our decisions. Perhaps only through the disclosure of our shortcomings shall we find clemency for ourselves.//

The Ethics Committee hereby votes to request a reclassification of SCP-1990 as an Explained phenomenon by the Classification Committee, and also requests SCP-1990-02 texts be publicly released by the Recordkeeping and Information Security Administration. The Committee also votes to reprimand all Foundation representatives on the Triptych Committee through a note on their personnel files.[[footnote]] This request was vetoed by the O5-4 Council Member.
