**Item #:** SCP-371-J

**Object Class:** Neutralized (Formerly Euclid)

**Special Containment Procedures:** N/A

**Description:** SCP-371-J is a single, shelled //Arachis hypogaea//[[footnote]] Peanut [[/footnote]] seed possessing cognitohazardous properties. When SCP-371-J is perceived by a human subject, they will begin laughing with varying intensity. The intensity at which laughter is induced is dependent on the amount of time a subject has spent working at a Foundation site, regardless of position or security clearance. Observed effects range from the spontaneous onset of pneumothorax[[footnote]] Collapsed lung [[/footnote]] on civilians to a moderate smile among various site directors. Subjects exposed to SCP-371-J will continue to laugh until they expire or SCP-371-J is removed from their vicinity. 

It is currently unknown why SCP-371-J's properties are related to the Foundation. Research into its creation, motives, and possible suspects responsible are currently under investigation.

**Discovery:** SCP-371-J was discovered following the death of 43 civilians in a Tokyo art exhibit, with all causes of death being attributed to a lack of oxygen. Foundation agents successfully located and contained SCP-371-J. Two personnel suffered injuries from falling after losing consciousness due to excessive laughter.
