**Item #**: SCP-2285

**Object Class**: Safe

**Special Containment Procedures**: All currently contained instances of SCP-2285-1, -2, -3, -4, -6, and -7 are to be contained separately by species, in containment chambers large enough for comfortable flight and exercise. SCP-2285-5, due to the sheer number of currently contained specimens, are to be contained in a significantly larger room, with no additional measures besides those described above.

Containment chambers are to be provided with two (2) "spray-mist" humidifiers running at all times in each of their respective chambers. SCP-2285s' containment chambers should be cleaned on a weekly basis. Should one of the humidifiers fail, it is to be replaced within a week. Subjects should also be given wall-mounted perches. Researchers who want to access SCP-2285 must have clearance level 2 or higher. 

Those wishing to donate toys to to SCP-2285 may do so at their own discretion. Search for additional specimens of SCP-2285 is currently ongoing. It is estimated upwards of one hundred and fifty (150) specimens of SCP-2285 are still uncontained.

**Description**: SCP-2285 is a designation given to approximately seven (7) different species belonging to the class //Aves//. These species can differ greatly in appearance, but a set of specific traits are common in all of them:
# Specimens of the SCP are able to camouflage themselves by taking on the  environment, with only a slight distortion effect signalling their appearance.
# Subjects require nothing more than condensed water vapor (clouds) for nourishment. SCP-2285 also seem to have preferences in regard to cloud types: some prefer cirrus, some prefer cumulus. SCP-2285-7 infallibly prefer cumulonimbus clouds over any other cloud type. Regardless of preference, all SCP-2285 will consume any type of water vapor if hungry enough.
# Subjects always appear to be specimens of extant bird species.
# SCP-2285 are capable of inhalation far past what their biological lungs would allow, and create a vacuum to funnel the water vapor into their beaks.
# Subjects are able to surpass the normal lifespan of each of their corresponding species by at least fifty (50) years.


|| **__Designation__** || **__Appearance__** || **__Notes__** ||
|| **SCP-2285-1** || //Archilochus colubris// (Ruby-throated Hummingbird) || Specimens of SCP-2285-1 appear to behave in the same manner as any //Archilocus colubis//, aside from their eating habits. Subjects also give SCP-2285-2 through 6 a wide berth, and do not interact with them. SCP-2285-1 do not interact with humans, and will hide whenever possible from them. SCP-2285-1's preferred cloud is cirrocumulus. There are currently forty (40) specimens of SCP-2285-1 contained.|| 
|| **SCP-2285-2** || //Turdus migratorius// (Red-breasted Robin) || SCP-2285-2 appear to behave in the same manner as their corresponding species, with one exception: SCP-2285-2 have been shown to be very friendly toward humans, and when called, will perch upon the caller's arm. SCP-2285-2's preferred cloud is altocumulus. There are currently thirty-six (36) specimens of SCP-2285-2 contained.||
|| **SCP-2285-3** || //Anodorhynchus glaucus// (Glaucus Macaw) || SCP-2285-3 behaves as normal for its corresponding species. However, as //Anodorhynchus glaucus// is critically endangered, securing SCP-2285-3 specimens for study has been difficult. In addition, determining the difference between a regular //Anodorhynchus glaucus// and SCP-2285-3 requires at least seven (7) days of observation. As such, the Foundation must avoid attention from the IUCN in order to contain SCP-2285-3. Only one (1) specimen of SCP-2285-3 is currently in containment. SCP-2285-3's preferred cloud is cumulus. || 
|| **SCP-2285-4** || //Ardea herodias// (Great Blue Heron) ||  SCP-2285-4 exhibit no behavioral differences from their corresponding species. There are currently five (5) specimens of SCP-2285-4 in containment. SCP-XXXX-4's preferred cloud is stratus. ||
|| **SCP-2285-5** || //Corvus corax// (Common Raven) || SCP-2285-5's preferred cloud is nimbostratus. A fully formed flock of SCP-2285-5 can devour an oncoming nimbostratus wave within minutes. For this reason, SCP-2285-5 present a threat to ecosystems that depend on essential rainfall. SCP-2285-5 have been given top priority, and staff are to be on the lookout for any additional specimens. There are currently three hundred and seventy-four (374) subjects in containment. ||
|| **SCP-2285-6** || //Vultur gryphus// (Andean Condor) || SCP-2285-6 do not differ behaviorally from their corresponding species. There are currently ten (10) specimens in containment. Despite being the largest bird, SCP-2285-6's preferred cloud is cirrus. ||
|| **SCP-2285-7** || //Haliaeetus leucocephalus// (Bald Eagle) || SCP-2285-7 differ little from their corresponding species behaviorally, with one notable difference. When treated well and given a level of respect, SCP-2285-7 appear to reciprocate accordingly. Given enough time, SCP-2285-7 will land on the arm of one with whom they seem to share this relationship, and attack any threats directed at the person. Why it does this is currently unknown. There are currently three (3) specimens in containment. SCP-2285-7's preferred clouds are those found in a supercell. As supercell clouds contain amounts of electricity that would normally be lethal for a normal bald eagle, it is unclear at this time how SCP-2285-7 processes the electricity safely. ||


**__Addendum SCP-2285-1__**

On ██/██/████, the behavior of all SCP-2285 changed dramatically. SCP-2285 refused to eat, instances became restless, and some displayed listless behavior, remaining on their perches instead initiating flight. In one extreme case, a large portion of the contained SCP-2285-5 began throwing themselves against their containment chamber's walls. Staff intervened and managed to prevent further harm to the specimens. Three (3) days later, all species' behavior returned to normal.

After reviewing of the data, the date of this event coincides with Hurricane ████████, which had indeed gone on for three days, causing ██ casualties and approximately $███,███ in property damage. It is assumed SCP-2285-5 were trying to escape containment in order to access the massive amounts of water present in the Hurricane ████████ weather system.

**__Addendum SCP-2285-2__**

Since SCP-2285's containment in 19██, hurricanes, tornadoes, and other severe storms have noticeably worsened and increased, according to on-site meteorologists and their reports. Deaths caused by severe storms is being recorded more frequently, up to a 25% increase over the last █ years, and storms above F3 on the Fujita Scale and Category 3 on the Saffir-Simpson Scale are becoming more common.   Whether this is due to the lack of SCP-2285 in natural environments is unknown. Foundation operatives have released a cover story about global warming affecting the severity of these storms.

Possible use of SCP-2285 as hurricane prevention is being discussed.
