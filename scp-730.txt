**Item #:** SCP-730

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-730 and associated materials and subjects are housed in Bio-site 07 in a Delta level containment facility.  Ongoing research necessitates regular staff interaction with affected materials. Researchers are required to undergo 36 hours of isolation and decontamination before leaving the containment facility. Any staff exposed to SCP-730 will be reclassified as a research subject and assigned to the facility indefinitely.

**Description:** SCP-730 is an engineered retrovirus developed in ████████, Italy by Dr. Antony Brilli. It infects and mutates developing mammalian embryos, including humans, causing abnormal anatomical development. Infected individuals grow to term as physically healthy fetuses lacking any anatomical features above the brain stem (see addendum 730-1 for full epidemiology).

This vestigial brain stem is capable of passive maintenance of the body’s functions, including heart rate, respiration, digestion, homeostatic function, and waste elimination. The affected individuals show no higher functionality but respond to pain stimuli, recoiling or fleeing in the limited fashion available. With the use of intravenous life support equipment it appears that the lifespan of affected individuals can be extended indefinitely, though owing to the complete alteration of their genomes by the retrovirus no recovery is possible.

Adult organisms cannot be infected by the virus, but act as passive carriers once exposed. The virus is spread by contact with any bodily excretion, including sweat. Once exposed an individual will continue to harbor a reservoir of the virus without experiencing any ill effects until they contact and expose a pregnant woman, whereupon the virus’s symptoms become manifest. Antivirals and inoculations have thus far been ineffective in cleansing carriers of the virus.

While Foundation operations in support of SCP-730’s recovery and public suppression were successful, the possibility that carrier individuals remain at large cannot be discounted. Surveillance of public health institutions is ongoing even as materials recovered from the initial outbreak are studied to seek a treatment.

**Capture Summary 730:** SCP-730 was designed to affect fertilized mammalian embryos and intervene in the developmental process to produce “decerebrated” or brainless organisms. It was Dr. Brilli’s intention to use this virus to produce animals without higher brain function which could be raised for meat production without the ethical complications of killing thinking creatures for food (see article 730-D).

Shortly after the first successful test with sheep embryos, the virus mutated and was able to cross into members of the Doctor’s staff. Because the virus does not manifest in adults, this jump was not initially detected. It was only once hospitals in the region reported an epidemic of unprecedented birth defects that the Foundation became interested and the cause identified. 

Fortunately the epidemic was intercepted before it spread beyond local confines to the global population. Sanitation procedures under the guise of a natural disaster denied the virus an endemic population of passive carriers to further its spread. Materials and infected subjects were obtained and isolated under Foundation custody for further study, as were Foundation personnel exposed during the initial investigation.


**Addendum 730-04:** 
12-04-????: fMRI imaging confirms activity in what is left of the brain stem during pain stimulation. Responses are more or less what you would expect given the lack of other sensory organs or cognitive capability.

12-06-????: Gerald noticed today that subject 293 began to flinch as soon as we moved the heated rod next to its skin. We hadn’t observed that behavior before, and it seemed to indicate a learned response to the stimulus, that a sensation of heat precedes a sensation of pain. I thought it was hysterical supposition, not uncommon when dealing with these subjects, but he convinced me to experiment further.

We began tapping test subjects 3 times before introducing a pain stimulus, and the subjects started to recoil from the tapping within a dozen repetitions of the process. How they manage to recognize and anticipate patterns without any cerebral function, indeed without a cerebellum, is beyond me at this point.


**Addendum 730-D: Excerpt from ████████████████ magazine** 
So you like steak but feel bad about killing Bessie to get it? Italian biologist Dr. Antony Brilli knows exactly how you feel.

“It made sense when we were a hunter-gatherer or agricultural society,” he says, “We’re omnivores. We need the protein.” Even in our post-agrarian society he acknowledges that conscientious vegetarians have a hard time balancing their diets. “We evolved on a diet that included complex polypeptides, basically animals, and it’s hard to get around that.” Not to mention, he notes, people who eat meat just for its culinary appeal.

“Now that science has come as far as it has, it gets harder to justify murder for sustenance.” Fortunately, Dr. Brilli says he might have found another way.

“With our procedure, you get an animal without any higher brain function at all, so killing it isn’t murder. And that condition is there since birth, since before that really. You’re basically growing meat as a vegetable, without the thorny ethical problems that intelligence injects.”

Are people ready to eat engineered meat? “Every technology goes through a tough adoption phase, and there will be naysayers. In the long run, though, it’s a choice between ethics and personal comfort. If we want to become a moral species we’ll have to change ourselves to get there.”
