**Do you read the SCP wiki?** Want the authors to improve their work so the stuff you read is better?

**Do you write for the SCP wiki?** Want to get more feedback (and votes) on your work?

You can help make this happen. 

The "Young and under 30" project is aiming to get more attention to articles less than a year old, and with a score of less than +30. These are often the articles getting the least attention on site, and we want to change that!

Every so often we'll flag up an article to try to raise discussion on it, and get it more votes (one way or another).  All we're going to do is read the article and share our thoughts on it, and encourage others to join the discussion and share their thoughts too.

This is not a one-person show.  This is not a staff or staff-sanctioned project, so everyone should feel free to contribute - you don't need permission, and the only rules that apply are the existing forum/crit rules.  Here's what you can do:

* look out for "Young and under 30" posts - read, vote and comment.

* plug the current Yau30 article on chat and reddit from time to time to stir interest.

* feel free to pick up articles from the list on your own and make the first Yau30 post on an article, especially if no-one else has kicked off a new Yau30 article in the past couple of days. Just remember to (a) announce it as a Yau30 review, so people know to look at it and comment; and (b) edit this page (including the box at the top of the page) to keep track of what's under review and the voting results.

I strongly encourage all readers to participate, whether you're an experienced author, newly published, lurking voter or only just joined the site. If you're only going to read / comment on one article each day, make it a Yau30 one - let's get people voting on and talking about under-reviewed articles. This is you making the site experience better for everyone.

A list of eligible articles is below, and there are links to articles we've reviewed in the next tab.
