**Item #:** SCP-1890

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** Item should be kept in an airtight container to prevent damage by exposure or pests; researchers and subjects handling the object are required to wear protective gloves. 

SCP-1890 is currently stored with the other Bonifay family artifacts at Research Sector-09.   

**Description:** SCP-1890 is a small photo album that appears to date from the late 19th century. The leather, paper, and adhesives which compose the album are non-anomalous, well-preserved but showing signs of age. 

The leather cover is engraved with the word “PHOTOGRAPHS”; the flipside is also engraved, but more clumsily, possibly hand-carved with an awl. The large capitals spell “BONIFAY”.

The number of album pages varies between 13 and 16, although the pages missing or additional are always blank. The album always contains the same 26 photographs, the images of places and individuals appearing unaltered; however, these photographs are not always arranged in the same order or position.     

Nine notations, written in English, have been marked in pen on several pages. The notes are simple shorthand indicating family names, places, and occasions. "Grandpa in the orange grove", "little Sally carries baby", "the wedding was a fine June day", "the old tire swing", and "rest in peace" each appear once; "Harlond Bonifay" and "Junior" each appear twice. Variations in handwriting indicate two different writers. 

While the arrangement of photos has been observed to shift frequently, the position of the notations do not. Several photos have shared the same label (ten different photos of young men have appeared over the label "Junior"), and identifying the original placement of photos and labels is impossible. 

None of the names or individuals in the photographs have been identified in archival documents or historical records of any kind, despite numerous of the geographical and architectural images confirming that the photos were originally taken between 1898 and 1912, in Apalachicola and Eastpoint, Florida.  

Experiments conducted over a period of eight months have determined that prolonged visual examination of the photographs permanently alters long term, short term, and working memory. This progression follows a consistent pattern.

> [after the three hour mark, subject begins obsessively returning to the same photo of a man posing outdoors] 
> 
> //Subject//: You said-- you wanted to know if I had any "comments" on these pictures, right? Because...it's so weird, but I think I've seen a picture of this guy before. As soon as I saw it I thought he looked kinda like my grandad-- that huge forehead-- and now I'm almost sure. I mean, haha, doesn't he look like the kind of guy who'd... [subject begins to turn the album toward the interviewer, and is firmly instructed to stop] ... right, sorry. 
> 
> It's just so odd! Where'd you say there were taken? Here in Florida? I think my mom said something about her folks having a place down here, once.  

**excerpt from interview with D-3487**  
> //Subject//: This doesn't look like a picture of a wedding, does it? Did this sonofabitch get kicked out of the party, or something? Heh. Have to get his picture taken standing in a bush, or something, all by himself? 
> 
> [subject flips between this photo and another, a wider shot of a landscape which features similar unkempt plants] 
> 
> Huh. These are some kind of historical photos, yeah? Pretty sure this is a landmark or something. I think I recognize it. This stuff that guy is standing in, it grows all around this big old house-- that grassy stuff has these little hooks that'll tear up your skin like shit. 
//**Note:** After two hours spent visually examining the photographs, the subject will remark on the familiarity of a place or individual. After the four hour mark, the subject will express increasing certainty that the place or person is familiar, and begin to recall vague sensory or biographical details relevant to the photo.//

**excerpt from interview with D-3487**  
> [upon opening the album, subject begins searching for a particular photograph, stopping and pointing to the same image of a landscape and a house that preoccupied them the day before]
> 
> //Subject:// Hell, what do you know? I’ve been thinking about it-- you know how I said I thought I’d visited this place, like it was a landmark? I don’t think that’s really why it’s familiar. I’m pretty sure I lived here for a while, when I was really young... just me and my ma. I'd almost completely forgotten, so much shit's happened since then. 
> 
> [the subject turns over the page, revealing a photograph of a bearded man currently positioned over the phrase “Grandpa in the orange grove”; subject gestures, excited]
> 
> Yeah-- and this photo was on the wall. In the kitchen, maybe? I can’t remember. I know I saw it there, though. I can remember it being high above my head, looking a lot bigger. I must have been really young. [subject shakes head, appearing apologetic]
> 
> All I can really remember is being too short to reach the sink, the one just under this window-- [subject gestures to the picture of a house on the previous page] and the way the floor creaked wherever you stepped. Used to scare me, late at night. [a chuckle]
//**Note:** Given access to the album for a second day, vague impressions will develop into increasingly detailed descriptions or places and people which the subject now "recalls". The more frequent and prolonged the exposure, the more detailed and extensive the subject's knowledge of the Bonifay family seems to grow.//

//**Note:** Continual exposure to SCP-1890 over a period of ten days (with each session lasting three to four hours) will result in newly-acquired memories replacing the subject's memories of their own life. While the subject will not assume the identity of any one individual in the photographs, they will increasingly refer to the people and places pictured as if narrating their own family history.//

[[collapsible show="+Test 4; 30 days, 120hrs." hide="-close"]]
//**Note:** Sustained exposure over a period of thirty days invariably results in the subject's long term memories permanently conforming to memories of the Bonifay family. Questions about the subject's immediate past, even the most recent traumas, will be met with surprise and confusion. Actual friends and family members are entirely forgotten.//

Permanently-affected subjects are still able to eat, sleep, and perform mundane tasks and basic puzzles. However, they retain only the vaguest recollection of these day-to-day activities-- expressing perplexity if questioned closely about foodstuffs or objects which do not feature in their anomalous memories. Subjects express disinterest in previous hobbies and most forms of entertainment, and are unwilling to engage in any prolonged conversation that does not involve their memories of the Bonifays.   

After forty days of exposure, subjects D-6███  and D-8███ have displayed confusion resembling Prosopagnosia, forgetting the names and identities of researchers and companions with whom they interact on a daily basis. 

Despite the extent of these psychological alterations, even permanently-affected subjects exhibit no signs of depression or self-destructive behavior. While their personal attachments and habits retreat, ultimately nullifying the subjects' will and individuality-- personality is superseded by tranquility, even in formerly violent or troubled subjects. 

**Addendum:**

The transcripts of subjects' Bonifay family "recollections" are extensive and varied. When these "recollections" are compared, it is clear that, while some particular details remain constant, no two stories about the Bonifay family are the same. The longest of these documents, the stories collected from D-6███  and D-8███, are respectively 26 and 32 pages in length, with new details still being "recalled".
