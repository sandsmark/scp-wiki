**Item #:** SCP-1890

**Object Class:** Safe 

**Special Containment Procedures:** Item should be kept in an airtight container to prevent damage by exposure or pests; researchers and subjects handling the object are required to wear protective gloves. Research staff are only permitted to examine copies of the photographs contained in SCP-1890. 

SCP-1890 is currently stored with the other Bonifay family artifacts[[footnote]] See [[[SCP-1896]]]. [[/footnote]] at Research Sector-09.   

**Description:** SCP-1890 is a small photo album that appears to date from the late 19th century. The leather, paper, and adhesives which compose the album are non-anomalous, well-preserved but showing signs of age. The leather cover is engraved with the word “PHOTOGRAPHS”; the flipside is also engraved, somewhat clumsily, with large capitals spelling “BONIFAY”.

The number of pages in the album varies between 13 and 16. The pages missing or additional are always blank, however, and the album always contains the same 26 photographs, images and materials unaltered. These photographs are not always arranged in the same order or position.  

Despite being labelled as a family photo album, the photographs depict individuals of various ethnicities -- the majority are African American, followed by Caucasian and mixed-race individuals clothed in the contemporary style of the Seminoles. Subject are posed in solitary portraits and with family members and/or personal possessions      

Nineteen notations have been made in ink on several pages. The notes are in American English-- simple shorthand indicating family names, places, and occasions. While the arrangement of photos shifts frequently, the position of the notations do not. For this reason, numerous photos have shared the same label. For example, photos of ten different young men have appeared over the label "Junior". Deducing the original placement of photos and labels is impossible. 

None of the names or individuals in the photographs have been identified in archival documents or historical records of any kind, despite geographical and architectural details suggesting that the photos were originally taken between 1890 and 1928, in Belle Glade and Pahokee, Florida. 

Direct examination of the contents of SCP-1890 for a prolonged period of time will result in symptoms of prosopagnosia. 
* Subjects exposed to the photographs for 12 hours (four hour intervals over three days) were able to describe the "Bonifay family members" very clearly, but they struggled to remember the names and identities of researchers and fellow inmates-- even individuals with whom they interacted on a daily basis. These symptoms were temporary, and the subject's memories returned to status quo after 24 hours removed from SCP-1890. 

* Subjects exposed to the photographs for more than 60 hours (four hour intervals over fifteen days) exhibited characteristics similar to acute prosopagnosia, finding it impossible to identify even familiar individuals by their facial features. Conversely, the subjects demonstrated a flawless ability to recall the details of all 26 Bonifay photographs, describing specifics like the shapes or species of trees, the number of buttons on a coat or new teeth in an infant's mouth.       

Acutely affected subjects (defined as individuals exposed to the photographs on a daily basis for more than 30 days) have displayed a persisting fascination with "the Bonifays"-- speculating on pastimes, personalities, and relationships.
