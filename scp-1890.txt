**Item #:** SCP-1890

**Object Class:** Safe 

**Special Containment Procedures:** Item should be kept in an airtight container to prevent damage by exposure or pests; researchers and subjects handling the object are required to wear protective gloves. Research staff are only permitted to examine copies of the photographs contained in SCP-1890. 

SCP-1890 is currently stored with the other Bonifay family artifacts at Research Sector-09.   

**Description:** SCP-1890 is a small photo album that appears to date from the late 19th century. The leather, paper, and adhesives which compose the album are non-anomalous, well-preserved but showing signs of age. 

The leather cover is engraved with the word “PHOTOGRAPHS”; the flipside is also engraved, but more clumsily, possibly hand-carved with an awl. The large capitals spell “BONIFAY”.

The number of album pages varies between 13 and 16, although the pages missing or additional are always blank. The album always contains the same 26 photographs, the images of places and individuals appearing unaltered; however, these photographs are not always arranged in the same order or position.     

Nine notations, written in English, have been marked in pen on several pages. The notes are simple shorthand indicating family names, places, and occasions. "Grandpa in the orange grove", "little Sally carries baby", "the wedding was a fine June day", "the old tire swing", and "rest in peace" each appear once; "Harlond Bonifay" and "Junior" each appear twice. Variations in handwriting indicate two different writers. 

While the arrangement of photos has been observed to shift frequently, the position of the notations do not. Several photos have shared the same label (ten different photos of young men have appeared over the label "Junior"), and identifying the original placement of photos and labels is impossible. 

None of the names or individuals in the photographs have been identified in archival documents or historical records of any kind, despite numerous of the geographical and architectural images confirming that the photos were originally taken between 1898 and 1912, in Apalachicola and Eastpoint, Florida.  

Experiments conducted over a period of eight months have determined that prolonged visual examination of SCP-1890 results in traumatic prosopagnosia. Subjects exposed to the photographs for 12 hours will be able to recall the Bonifay images very clearly, but begin to struggle to remember the names and identities of researchers and fellow inmates, even those they interact with on a daily basis. 

Subjects exposed to the photographs for more than 60 hours exhibit characteristics similar to acute prosopagnosia, finding it impossible to identify any individual by their facial features. Conversely, the subjects will demonstrate a flawless ability to recall the details of the Bonifay photographs-- even such specifics as the shapes of trees, the number of buttons on a coat or teeth in an infant's mouth.       

Acutely affected subjects (individuals exposed to the photographs on a daily basis, for more than 30 days) slowly lose interest previous relationships, hobbies, and most forms of entertainment, but display a persisting fascination with Bonifays-- even to the point of inventing elaborate Bonifay family histories.
