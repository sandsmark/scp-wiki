title:Dr. Mackenzie's Documentation Tips
Or, an attempt to explain why your article was down-voted into oblivion.

//It should also be noted that this is in no way an official document. You are free to make your article the way YOU want it made, not by these arbitrary beliefs.// -Dr. Bright

**Content:**
We all get ideas sometimes, and some are better than others. However, for most of the senior staff and even veteran members, we've seen quite a bit, and turned down quite a bit as well. Before you get excited about posting your first SCP, ask yourself whether your SCP fits into the following categories:

* **Creepy** - For the purposes of these guidelines, creepy means there's something innately wrong about the object in question. Whether it does something that defies the laws of physics or generates some kind of cosmic horror, this is something that causes primal fear and revulsion in most humans. Very often this is something that is a personal phobia, but ask yourself whether this is a __common__ phobia.
* **Mysterious** - Something that is out of place or unexplained. Otherwise ordinary objects or beings that shouldn't be able to exist where they are. These are things that do not necessarily frighten us, but dig into our curiosity and make us want to find out how it works or where it came from.
* **Dangerous** - These things are either difficult to handle or contain, or are simply capable of causing us immense harm. This one is the easiest to add to an idea, but also generally the most common.

Ask yourself whether your SCP fits into these categories. If it fits strongly into at least two, then you're probably on the right track! If it's weak in two or more areas, try to think of ways to up the ante.

**Formatting:**
The second most common problem I see is that newer authors tend to botch the Description section of their articles by not sounding clinical enough. We must constantly remind us that part of the horror of what the Foundation does is in how cold and inhuman our organization is.

This is the 4-section format that I write nearly all of my articles in, and will work for all but the most bizarre SCPs:

# **Physical Description** - In the first paragraph, try to give a short introduction to what the item is, or resembles. There's nothing wrong with starting your Description with a blunt, "SCP-XXX is a __???__". If something terrible happened and someone who didn't know what the SCP was had to deal with it, they need to know how to identify the object quickly and easily. Try not to go over one paragraph, you don't need to describe the object in brutal detail.
# **Anomalous Properties** - After you've established how the object can be identified, establish what is so abnormal about it that the Foundation needs to be involved. This will generally be something along the lines of "When SCP-XXX is __???__, __???__ happens." Again, don't be afraid to be blunt and to the point, as that's exactly what we're trying to shoot for.
# **Source** - Next, tell us how this object came to our attention. Did someone bring it to the Foundation? Was it discovered after it was triggered and caused civilian casualties? How did we contain it initially? What kind of damage has it caused in the past? _
         //It should be noted this step is optional. Several good SCPs tell us nothing about how or why we have them. Also, these stories tend to be where most people screw up the whole 'technical, emotionless writing' thing.// -Dr. Bright _

# **Current Status** - Finish off by giving us a brief of its current condition. Is it safely contained now, or still volatile? Is additional research planned? What are we planning to do with it in the near future? Who has been assigned to do this?

I call this the standard 1-2-3-4 format. Sometimes, when the Anomalous Properties section becomes extremely long, you can opt for a 1-3-2-4 format to make the article flow better. Use your best judgment, but try to follow one of these two formats if you're unsure!

**Establishing the Tone**
Sometimes it's hard for us to pinpoint exactly why we like something as much as we do, but there are a few very important details while you are writing an article that must not go forgotten.

Part of what draws us to the Foundation is its faceless nature: names are rarely mentioned, as even the highest ranked researcher is merely a cog in the great machine that is the Foundation. The articles that we write are cold and clinical, and we do not flinch at even the greatest cosmic horrors or terrible loss of life. To help keep that tone, try not to mention anyone by name, even "Dr. [DATA EXPUNGED]". Try to use "...with permission from at least one level _ personnel" instead of "...with permission from Dr. _".

**To Log or Not to Log?:**
Experiment or Incident Logs are a great way to spruce up an otherwise bland article, but don't overdo it. If the SCP has a very robust Description, then logs probably aren't needed. However, if the article's description is fairly plain, and much of what makes it interesting lies in a specific situation, then some logs may be necessary to bring it up to snuff.

Furthermore, there is often a common misconception about the purpose of an Experiment Log due to the huge popularity of "SCP makers" such as [[[SCP-914]]]. Adding a template, or "how to write your own experiment log entry" section to most articles is grossly unnecessary, and breaks the tone of the article. Logs for most articles are intended to simply illustrate the effects of the SCP, not to propose additional experimentation (unless, of course, that is what you intend to do).

**Examples:**
* [[[SCP-269]]] is an example of a slightly Creepy, moderately Mysterious, and moderately Dangerous SCP that follows the 1-2-3-4 description format. The anomalous properties section is probably near the upper limit for length before a 1-3-2-4 format is preferable. The description of SCP-269 is robust enough to work very well without an experiment log.
* [Deleted]
* [[[SCP-065]]] is an example of a moderately Creepy, moderately Mysterious, and highly Dangerous SCP that follows a typical 1-3-2-4 format. A list of effects generally precludes the need to have a log unless you want to give very specific examples of what the SCP does.
