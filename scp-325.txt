          **Item #:** SCP-325

          **Object Class:** Euclid

          **Special Containment Procedures:**  SCP-325 is composed of two entities (SCP-325 and SCP-325-1) and is to be stored at Site-██, away from any washing or cleaning facilities. SCP-325 should be held inside its designated Level 2 Biological containment box (measuring 30cm x 10cm x 10cm) outside of controlled testing. All handling of the SCP should be done while wearing Level 2 HAZMAT suits.

      The containment box may be safely stored with other SCPs, but the personnel guarding SCP-325 should have all their clothes washed away from Site-██. At least one guard should be issued with a standard issue Foundation flamethrower unit. This is to be used on any spills of SCP-325.

          **Description:** SCP-325 is a small bottle of ██████ brand washing detergent, a product commonly sold in the United Kingdom. However, the "█████ █████ █████!" name present on the label does not match any of the ████████ company's current products. SCP-325 contains a semi-viscous yellow liquid, which holds several million of SCP-325-1 in suspension at any given time. SCP-325 was recovered from the ███████ Laundrette in ████████, England, where it had been used for several large loads before being contained.

      Lab tests have confirmed the liquid to be a standard detergent mix from the ████████ company. Further tests have revealed that the scent is a close match to their "Citrus Blossom" range, and that the liquid produced by SCP-325 is normal, aside from the presence of SCP-325-1. SCP-325 will slowly refill itself if used, however it will never contain more than one (1) litre of fluid. Samples show that SCP-325 can be destroyed like any other plastic, however, all damage so far has been slowly repaired by the SCP itself.

      SCP-325-1 is a small micro-organism closely resembling Bythotrephes Cederestroemii, of the Cladocera family. SCP-325-1 will stay in suspended animation until they are close to a suitable heat source. The optimum temperature level for SCP-325-1 to animate is ~36°C, around 1°C lower than the human body. SCP-325-1 reproduces by mitosis, yet even if SCP-325 is emptied completely, more will appear inside. This is assumed to be caused by SCP-325-1 trapped inside the plastic of SCP-325.

      Once a garment is washed in the liquid produced by SCP-325, it will be infested with several million SCP-325-1. Once this item is worn by a subject (hereafter referred to as the victim), SCP-325-1 will burrow into the skin, making their way to the  bloodstream. SCP-325-1 elicits no reaction from the Victim's immune system, even though the organisms are of a size that should cause inflammation on the victim's skin.

      Once inside the bloodstream, SCP-325-1 will rapidly multiply and destroy any hostile microbe, with no differentiation made between the Victim's own white blood cells and foreign microbial life such as bacteria and virii. This also includes all bacteria inside the gut. However, this loss of cells will make no difference to the subject, as SCP-325-1 will differentiate and take the places of any essential microbes destroyed, in order to keep the subject alive. SCP-XXX-1 will not destroy the victim's red blood cells.

      After infection, the victim will move through 5 phrases (See addendum SCP-325-A for details on an alternate fifth stage observed during initial containment by Agent █████). The length of each phase depends on the person infected, and as such have no defined timeline at current. Further research is ongoing.

      The stages of infection and the behaviours observed in each are as follows:

      Stage 1 -  Victim will show heightened awareness of infectious agents and possible points of germ transmission. This is usually manifested in behaviour such as frequent hand washing, and more frequent cleaning of their abode. However, other than this display of cleanliness, victims will appear normal and unchanged.

      Stage 2 - Victim will begin to shun social contact of all kind, interviews with infected victims have them describe the outside world as 'Unclean'. However, they will start to stockpile large amounts of cleaning fluids and canned food in their homes. Upon return from each trip, subjects will clean themselves vigorously.

      Stage 3 - Clothing and similar items will be removed by the subject, and usually burnt. At this point the victim will not go outside for any reason. In late-term Stage 3, victims will clean their skin fervently, usually resulting in chemical burns to approximately ██% of the skin.

      Stage 4 - Currently the infection stage of most interest to the Foundation, in Stage 4 the Victim will believe only their own blood is a truly clean substance. Victims cleaning their internal organs by [DATA EXPUNGED] has also been observed during Stage 4, however this behaviour appears to be rare.

      By [DATA EXPUNGED] and mixing their blood with whatever cleaning solutions are present, the Victim will create SCP-325-2. SCP-325-2 is by all accounts a perfect cleaning agent, as it will kill any infectious agents and/or microbial life on a surface with 100% efficiency, including those created by SCP-███, SCP-███ and SCP-███.

      However, SCP-325-1 will remain on the surface for around 12 hours, and also diffuse into the air while still wet. This makes SCP-325-1 highly dangerous, as victims will often coat much of their house with SCP-325-2 before falling into a comatose state. This behaviour has caused ██ confirmed deaths so far, in addition to those stated below.

      Only 40% of subjects will progress into Stage 5. Only one case of Stage 5-Omega has been reported to date (see addendum SCP-325-A).

      Stage 5 - Stage 5 is the main transmission method of SCP-325-1. Once a subject enters Stage 5, they will awake from the comatose state entered in Stage 4, and fill the nearest container with SCP-325-2. Once this is complete, victims will attack the nearest person, deeming them to be 'Unclean' and covering them in SCP-XXX-2. As skin contact with SCP-325-2 has a 100% transmission rate, those attacked will always be infected by SCP-325-1.

      The remains of subjects infected by SCP-325 in any way should be disposed of via incineration. Normal weaponry is sufficient to kill a still-live victim, and under no circumstances should physical contact be made. All Foundation agents are authorised to terminate confirmed cases of SCP-325-1 outbreak, with standard NBC cleanup operating procedures for disposing of remains in the field.

          **Addendum SCP-325-A:**According to the debrief information from Agent ██████, a second form of fifth stage infection has been observed. His report is validated by a video feed recorded from the operative's helmet, and shows a Victim in Stage 5 growing in mass rapidly while turning red. Once the victim has reached roughly ███% of their original mass, they then proceed to [DATA EXPUNGED], coating the surrounding area with copious amounts of SCP-325-2

      This behaviour of SCP-325-1 has only been observed once, but all agents responding to SCP-XXX-1 outbreaks should be aware that this alternate fifth stage cost the lives of ## civilians and # agents.

          **Addendum SCP-325-B:**As SCP-325-2 has been shown to destroy any microbial agent, research is undergoing to remove the harmful after-effects caused by the presence of SCP-325-1. This agent has shown it's effectiveness against SCP's [REDACTED], and as such is considered a medium priority research. It may also be useful in the neutralisation of [REDACTED].

      All researchers must submit their test applications to Dr. ████████, and once a sufficient volume of tests are scheduled, one (1) D-Class will be exposed to SCP-325 infection and the resulting SCP-325-2 collected. All used test samples of SCP-325-2 should be incinerated.
