++++ **__Special Containment Procedures__**
Due to the nature of the SCP-5107, direct containment is impossible.

All [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle_of_the_Sun public evidence] of SCP-5107 has been confiscated, discredited, or tampered with and is kept within the Site-51 Archive. Due to the efforts of Foundation assets in historic academia, SCP-5107 has been established as a hoax or illusion in the majority of public opinion. This cover will be perpetuated further if necessary.

++++ **__Description__**
SCP-5107 was a phenomenon witnessed by approximately 50,000 people on 1917/10/15, in a field near Fátima, Portugal. At 12:37 GMT for approximately 10 minutes, the sun appeared to move erratically; this was corroborated through photographic evidence and testimony of Foundation agents present. SCP-5107 included an auditory event that analysis revealed to be a conversation in Modern Hebrew, spoken in reverse by unknown entities, designated SCP-5107-A and SCP-5107-B.

++++ **__Discovery__**
Between May and September of 1917, three children named Lucia Santos (9), Jacinta Margo (6), and Francisco Margo (7) gained local renown for their public testimonies of the "Virgin Mary" speaking to them from the sky above Fatima, Portugal. One month prior to SCP-5107, the children stated that the phenomenon would be visible to all in attendance on the date. Approximately 50,000 civilians were in attendance on 1917/10/15, including Foundation Junior Investigative Agents, Thomas Wright and Peter Gladsby. The following audio log was transcribed and translated for ease of access:

The agents present during SCP-5107 underwent extensive medical and psychological analysis and a large quantity of Compound N78E3 was discovered in the systems. Compound N78E3 is regularly used in the creation of Class-Amnestics and is theorized to be the cause of the localized perception of SCP-5107. The source of the Compound N78E3 present was not identified and no further SCP-5107 activity has occurred.
