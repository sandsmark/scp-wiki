**Item #:** SCP-2568

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** Each instance of SCP-2568 is to be contained in a cubical enclosure constructed of 9 smaller cubes. Each smaller box will be 9 centimeters on each side, with an error of at most 0.1 centimeters. It must be kept in a room with walls at least 9 cm thick. Paths from the object to the walls, floor, and ceiling should be kept clear of objects that might be harmed by a steel ball appearing inside them.

Following incident SCP-2568-C, if multiple instances are contained within the same room, they are not to be placed directly in line with each other, to reduce the risk of collisions.

A magnet of sufficient strength to counteract the force of gravity at the center of the central box is to be placed at the top of the containment apparatus, along with variable strength electromagnets placed on all four sides, connected to the in-box sensors, in order to cancel out any virtual velocity the item might pick up.

Each box is to be equipped with three laser --or ultrasonic-- rangefinders, one on each axis, pointed at the center of the box. //Note: See Addendum 2568-A regarding the use of ultrasonic rangefinders.// The distance measurements from these sensors are to be continuously monitored by an automatic program and used to adjust the strength of the magnets in the case of the item moving. The calibration of the magnets and sensors is to be checked during regular monthly maintenance. Continuous human monitoring is considered wasteful and unnecessary at this time.

An instance of SCP-2568 which acquires a significant velocity such that electromagnetic containment apparatus is unable to contain it will almost certainly lodge itself in the chamber walls or some other solid object, from which it can easily be retrieved. For this reason, it has been classified as Safe.

SCP-2568-1 is --non-anomalous-- anomalous but classified as Safe. It is extremely old; as such, it should be kept in a glass or ceramic case with a neutral pressure argon atmosphere to prevent any degradation, as per normal Foundation Archives protocol. Full transcriptions of its surface markings are to be stored in redundant electronic and physical forms so as to prevent any possible loss of information.

**Description:** SCP-2568 is a collection of --twenty-nine (29)--  twenty-seven (27) steel balls --3 centimeters-- 2.9979 centimeters in diameter. Instances of SCP-2568 appear to have no anomalous properties except that they move only in increments of --6 centimeters-- two times their diameter along their axes and rotate only in increments of 45 degrees around their axes.

**Note:** Units of Measure.  [[collapsible show="+ View" hide="- Hide"]]

The actual diameter of each instance of SCP-2586 is exactly the distance that light can travel in 100 picoseconds (29,979 microns, 2.9979  centimeters) on average, with expected variance from pitting and wear. This was not determined with precision until several years after the recovery of SCP-2568 through the use of microwave interferometry. The difference between 29,979 microns and the 30,000 micron measurements used in all existing containment gear is small enough not to present a problem, as evinced by the fact that the holes on SCP-2568-1 vary by as much as 1000 microns and have no trouble containing instances of SCP-2586, and in fact is outside the manufacturing tolerances of all but the most expensive equipment available.

Similarly, the movement of SCP-2586 is limited not to increments of 60,000 microns, but 59,958 microns, or twice the nominal radius.

When a force is applied to an SCP-2568 object, it acquires a "virtual" velocity; that is, if a force were applied which would accelerate it to 1 cm/s, it would rest in place for 3 seconds, then teleport 3 centimeters in the direction in which the force was applied.

//Note by Dr. M█████: This is, of course, relative to the planet Earth. If not, each of these things would be constantly hopping about and flashing as the planet turns and moves through space. I'd love to get one of these out into the Moon's gravity well and see what happens!//

//Note by O5-█: Request denied. That's a little more expense than we can stomach for a Safe at this time.//

As mentioned above, these items cannot move except along three perpendicular axes. The vertical axis is oriented upwards (that is, toward and away from Earth's gravitational center), but the two horizontal axes are not aligned to gravity, magnetic fields, or any other obvious means of directional determination. The axes are fixed and cannot be changed by any means so far devised.

When one of the objects does move, it emits a flash of electromagnetic radiation in all frequencies at the destination, the brightness of which scales linearly with the object's virtual velocity. Dr. M█████ is currently working on the initial stages of a test to determine if useful energy can be extracted from this process; for now, he has advised all personnel handling SCP-2568 to be careful not to accelerate them to too great a velocity, as they could theoretically produce harmful levels of ionizing radiation.

**Addendum 2568-A:** Initial recovery.  [[collapsible show="+ View" hide="- Hide"]]

The first example of SCP-2568 was recovered from its resting place in the tomb of ███████ in Eritrea. During initial containment at Provisional Site ██, the object's position was measured with consumer-grade ultrasonic rangefinders due to availability. The sound waves emitted during their operation imparted a virtual velocity to the object which eventually caused it to "hop" out of the containment tent, through several meters of air, and into the cereal bowl of a member of the expedition during breakfast, causing surprise and distress but no injuries. Henceforth, only laser rangefinders are to be used in containment to prevent this kind of incident in the future.

**Addendum 2568-B:** Recovery of later samples. [[collapsible show="+ View" hide="- Hide"]] 

Further excavation of the tomb of ███████ has revealed twenty-eight (28) additional items with the same properties, hereby classified as additional instances of SCP-2568. They were found in various positions on a square piece of very hard, ornately carved and painted oak wood, about 4 cm thick, with 3 cm hemispherical divots spaced 3cm apart in an 8x8 grid. This object is hereby classified SCP-2568-1.

Foundation anthropologists, posing as Eritrean government officials, cooperated with researchers from the British Museum and the University of Cambridge Museum of Anthropology and Archaeology to determine that SCP-2568-1 was most likely a game board of some kind, and was produced at least [REDACTED] years ago, which is consistent with the age of the tomb from which it was recovered.

**Addendum 2568-C:** Incident log.  [[collapsible show="+ View" hide="- Hide"]]

__**Incident 2568-C**__
> **Situation:**
> Two instances of SCP-2568 in their containment boxes were placed in the same secure locker area, one above the other. As the standard lockers at Facility ██ are 18 centimeters tall, when the power supply on the upper object's containment apparatus failed, it gained a virtual velocity due to the force of gravity and fell through the top of the second container's box. The sensors in that container detecting both objects triggered a bug in the the control program which caused it to emit the maximum values for the associated electromagnets, applying a very high force to the lower SCP-2568 instance. When the upper one proceeded, a few microseconds later, to move downward into the same space as the lower one, the magnetic forces prevented either one from appropriately vacating the space as normal.
> **Results:**
>  The sudden duplication of mass and collision of particles within the strong magnetic field caused ██████ to ████ with the ████ of the upper instance, creating ████ and a massive explosion which destroyed the entire locker area. This caused a minor containment breach in which SCP-████ killed 8 security personnel before being contained. █ Safe SCPs and ██ anomalous items awaiting classification were lost.
> **Notes:**
> Dr. D███████ and Dr. M████ agree that such incidents can be entirely avoided by simply spacing out these objects diagonally, so they cannot easily move into the same space. In addition, the control program has been corrected for all remaining containers.

//Note by Dr. D███████: This raises some interesting questions. Clearly these things are dangerous, but perhaps only when they are so tightly contained? On a board like SCP-2568-1 they would collide all the time, and we have to assume that they were safe enough to be played with.//

**Addendum 2568-D:** Experiment log.  [[collapsible show="+ View" hide="- Hide"]]


__**Experiment 2568-D**__
> **Situation:**
> Four instances of SCP-2568 were placed on SCP-2568-1. D-2568-22 was informed that he would be "well rewarded" if he were to successfully cause them to collide. After a few minutes of getting used to their anomalous properties, he managed to maneuver them into place on the board.
> **Results:**
>  When any two instances were made to collide, the one not moving was bumped out of its place in the direction of the moving one, but only by one space. When at the edge, both simply stopped. How this happens is unknown; in theory, the non-moving instance should be bumped off the board and continue into free space.
> When all four instances were made to collide, each emitted a very bright flash of light and all four acquired an extreme virtual velocity. Two ricochetted around the board until succumbing to friction and settling down. One flew off the board at an angle and embedded itself in the 10 cm glass of the observation room, and the fourth disappeared. D-2568-22 fell unconscious and was declared dead when medics entered the chamber; upon attempting to move his body, it was discovered that the final instance of SCP-2568 had passed through his skull and into his brain stem, killing him instantly.
> **Notes by Dr. D██████:**
> Clearly, SCP-2568-1 is capable of controlling the virtual velocity of these objects in a way that we don't understand. I suggest an immediate reclassification of that item as anomalous, under a Safe categorization, and a good deal of further testing.
