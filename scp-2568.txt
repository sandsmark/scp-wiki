**Item #:** SCP-2568

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** Each instance of SCP-2568 is to be contained in a cubical enclosure constructed of 9 smaller cubes. Each smaller box will be 10 centimeters on each side, with an error of at most 0.1 centimeters. It must be kept in a room with walls at least 10 cm thick. Paths from the object to the walls, floor, and ceiling should be kept clear of objects that might be harmed by a steel ball appearing inside them.

A magnet of sufficient strength to counteract the force of gravity exactly at the center of the central box is to be placed at the top of the containment apparatus, along with variable strength electromagents placed on all four sides, connected to the in-box sensors, in order to cancel out any virtual velocity the item might pick up.

Each box is to be equipped with three laser --or ultrasonic-- rangefinders, one on each axis, pointed at the center of the box. //Note: See Addendum 2568-A regarding the use of ultrasonic rangefinders.// The distance measurements from these sensors are to be continuously monitored by an automatic program and used to adjust the strength of the magnets in the case of the item moving. The calibration of the magnets and sensors is to be checked during regular monthly maintenance. Continuous human monitoring is considered wasteful and unnecessary at this time.

In the event that the item acquires a significant velocity and the electromagnetic containment apparatus does not contain it, it will almost certainly lodge itself in the chamber walls or some other solid object, from which it can easily be retrieved; for this reason, it has been classified as Safe.

SCP-2568-1 is non-anomalous, but is extremely old; as such, it should be kept in a glass or ceramic case full with argon to prevent any degradation, as per normal Foundation Archives protocol. It should not be removed except for experimentation.

**Description:** SCP-2568 is a collection of twenty-nine (29) steel balls exactly 3 centimeters in diameter. Each is, according to every test performed so far, entirely normal except for two anomalous properties: they move only in increments of 5 centimeters along their axes and rotate only in increments of 45 degrees around their axes.

When a force is applied to an SCP-2568 object, it acquires a "virtual" velocity; that is, if a force were applied which would accelerate it to 1 cm/s, it would rest in place for 5 seconds, then teleport 5 centimeters in the direction in which the force was applied. 

As mentioned above, items cannot move except along three perpendicular axes. The vertical axis is oriented upwards (that is, toward and away from Earth's gravitational center), but the two horizontal axes are not aligned to gravity, magnetic fields, or any other obvious means of directional determination. The axes are fixed and cannot be changed by any means so far devised.

//Note by Dr. ████████: There are two major schools of thought on these axes at this time. I am of the opinion that their orientation is random, but Dr. ██████ thinks they are fundamental to the universe in some way. I don't think there is any way to know without additional items that act in a similar manner, but I wouldn't try telling him that. It's become almost like a religion with him. Typical theoretician crap.//

When one of the objects does move, it emits a flash of electromagnetic radiation in all spectra at the destination, the brightness of which scales linearly with the object's virtual velocity. Dr. ██████ is currently working on the initial stages of a test to determine if useful energy can be extracted from this process; for now, he has advised all personnel handling the items to be careful not to accelerate them to too great a velocity, as they could theoretically produce harmful radiation.

**Addendum 2568-A:** The first example of SCP-2568 was recovered from its resting place in the tomb of ███████ in █████. During initial containment at Provisional Site ██, the object's position was measured with consumer-grade ultrasonic rangefinders due to availability. The sound waves emitted during their operation imparted a virtual velocity to the object which eventually caused it to "hop" out of the containment tent, through several meters of air, and into the cereal bowl of a member of MTF ████ during breakfast, causing surprise and distress but no injuries. Henceforth, only laser rangefinders are to be used in containment to prevent this kind of incident in the future.

**Addendum 2568-B:** Further excavation of the tomb of ███████ has revealed twenty-eight (28) additional items with the same properties, hereby classified as additional instances of SCP-2568. They were found in various positions on SCP-2568-1, a square piece of very hard, ornately carved and painted oak wood, about 4 cm thick, with 1.5 cm hemispherical divots spaced 5cm apart in an 8x8 grid.

Once it was determined to be non-anomalous, Foundation researchers posing as a private collector released SCP-2568-1 to civilian anthropologists at the British Royal ███████ and the ███████████ Institute, who determined that it was almost certainly a game board and that it was at least 1███ years old.

//Note by Dr. ████████: This explains why it was in the tomb, and why it existed in the first place, but raises some other questions; did the ancient ████████ have such advanced technology that such things as SCP-2568 could be used frivolously? If not, how did they come to posses so many of these things? Perhaps they were used to measure out the precise distances required for the construction of the ████ of ████████? I recommend further investigation of the tomb.//
