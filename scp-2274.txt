**Item #:** SCP-XXXX

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-XXXX is to be kept within its box in Standard Secure Locker #56. Under no circumstances should any personnel directly view SCP-XXXX. No testing is permitted at this time.

**Description:** SCP-XXXX is a statue, 46 cm in height, made of metal of an indeterminate color. It depicts a humanoid figure, with a clearly defined torso and head and limbs that taper to points, without hands or feet, standing upright on a square base.

    Any human being who views SCP-XXXX will halt all activity and assume a neutral standing position, staring fixedly at SCP-XXXX. These subjects cannot be persuaded to assume a seated or prone position, nor to have SCP-XXXX leave their line of sight. Subjects seem incapable of autonomously performing any task other than remaining upright, including the basic requirements for living. If left alone, subjects will die of dehydration within 74 hours. Subjects under the influence of SCP-XXXX show extremely limited ability or willingness to communicate. They do not respond to questioning, unless asked one of two questions: when asked “what do you do?”, subjects invariably respond “I stand, as he stands.” [[footnote]]Asking “what are you doing?” also procures this response in 22% of cases.[[/footnote]] When asked “what does he do?”, with reference to SCP-XXXX, subjects invariably respond “he stands because he must.”

    Photographs and video footage of SCP-XXXX have the same effect, as does viewing any portion of the object, whether in a photograph or directly. Viewing SCP-XXXX in silhouette does not have any effect, nor does viewing the shape of the object while it is completely wrapped in cloth or paper.

    If the subject is forced to assume a seated or prone position, or if SCP-XXXX is removed from a subject’s line of sight, the subject will react violently, attacking whomever is instigating the change (See Interview Log XXXX-1). No supernatural strength or unusual speed has been observed in subjects during these outbursts.

At present, no observed subjects have recovered from the effects of SCP-XXXX.

**Addendum XXXX-1:** The object was recovered from the home of Kerry █████ in ██████, Texas on ██/██/20██, when a friend who had gone over to have dinner dialed 911, stating that Ms. █████ was “just standing there saying nothing except ‘I stand as he stands.’” Remaining on the line with the 911 operator, he tried to force her to turn towards him as they waited for first responders. She responded by delivering a blow that seemed to cause him to lose consciousness. [[footnote]]An autopsy of the man revealed a significant recent contusion and moderate amounts of bruising on the scalp.[[/footnote]] He was later found under the influence of SCP-XXXX alongside her.

The police officers who responded to the call were found also under the effect of SCP-XXXX. This development led to widespread fear amongst the police force, which alerted Agent ████ and led the Foundation to launch an investigation. After the loss of Mobile Task Force [REDACTED], the object, along with a cardboard box in which it was contained, and two typed notes within the box (documents XXXX-I and XXXX-II) was recovered by drone and brought to Site-19. Neither the box nor the notes have exhibited any anomalous properties.

> **Interviewed:** D-1366
> 
> **Interviewer:** Doctor ███
> 
> **Foreword:** Interview concerning D-1366 witnessing another D-class personnel attempt to remove SCP-XXXX from containment. Subject had been unaware of SCP-XXXX’s effects, and attempted to interact with the personnel. Subject was unable to give a report for several days as she was in a state of shock and was generally unresponsive. 
> 
> **<Begin Log>**
> 
> **Doctor ███:** Please state what you saw.
> 
> **D-1366:** Uh, shit, Doctor, uh ████, I think? He sent me to get something from one of the lockers in that room way far in the back. He gave me these, uh, these pink rubber gloves to handle it. 
> 
> **Doctor ███:** When did you become aware of D-████?
> 
> **D-1366:** Uh, well the guard at the door smiled at me when he let me by so I was thinking about that and it was kind of distracting, you know? So, I almost ran into him 'cause I wasn't looking where I was going. He was standing in the… second row. Three lockers down from where I was going. He was just standing there, in front of an open locker.
> 
> **Doctor ███:** Could you see what was in the locker?
> 
> **D-1366:** I think it was a cardboard box. He was staring into it. It was tall enough that I couldn’t see what was inside. He was also, like, //right// in front of the locker –  like, his forehead was touching the edges of the front. I could barely see around him at all. I'm not even sure that was really a box. There are some weird things here, you know? Maybe it just looked like a box but it was something else.
> 
> **Doctor ███:** I can assure you it was a box. Did you feel any particular need to see what was inside the locker?
> 
> **D-1366:** No, but you asked what I saw. I'm just doing my best, man.
> 
> **Doctor ███:** What happened next?
> 
> **D-1366:** Nothing. He didn’t turn or move. He acted like I wasn’t there, you know?
> 
> **Doctor ███:** How did you react?
> 
> **D-1366:** I was a little scared. I thought he might be having a stroke or something, so I figured I could take the time to make sure he was okay, you know? I figured it was, like, my responsibility, almost. So, I was like, “hey, what are you doing?”
> 
> **Doctor ███:** How did he respond?
> 
> **D-1366:** He, uh, [D-1366 clears throat] he said, “I stand, as he stands,” really flatly. Like, no emotion at all.
> 
> **Doctor ███:** How did you react to that?
> 
> **D-1366:** Well, I was kind of spooked, you know? He was just kind of acting all creepy. I wasn’t sure what he meant and I kind of thought he was fucking with me, so I went to turn him around and…
> 
> **Doctor ███:** And what?
> 
> **D-1366:** And he attacked me.
> 
> **Doctor ███:** What exactly happened?
> 
> **D-1366:** Well, I grabbed him on the shoulder and I turned him to face me. His eyes were really, really glassy. There was drool on his chin. He just stood there and looked at me for, like, a second. Then he roared. 
> 
> **Doctor ███:** Roared?
> 
> **D-1366:** Yeah, roared. Not screamed, not shouted, roared. Like, really loudly. It sounded like it was coming from way down in his gut, like someplace primal, you know? It felt like it was vibrating the entire building. It was really scary and weird. It didn’t sound…
>  
> [Subject pauses]
> 
> **Doctor ███:** What?
> 
> **D-1366:** It didn’t sound human.
>  
> **Doctor ███:** What happened next?
> 
> **D-1366:** He grabbed me by the throat and started choking me. My vision started to go blurry, and I was thinking “this is it,” you know? “This is how I die.” I was terrified. They always say you're supposed to feel really calm when you realize you're gonna die, but I was really freaking out.
>  
> **Doctor ███:** Then what happened?
> 
> **D-1366:** The guard from the front of the room appeared at the other end of the row. He must have come investigating the roar. He pulled the other guy off of me.
>  
> **Doctor ███:** Then what?
> 
> **D-1366:** Then he shot him.
>  
> [Subject is silent]
> 
> **Doctor ███:** Do you remember anything after that?
> 
> **D-1366:** No. I passed out. I don’t really remember much at all since then. I’m sorry if there’s something important I forgot. It’s just a lot, you know?
>  
> **Doctor ███:** I understand.
> 
> **D-1366:** I keep seeing him in my mind, over and over, you know? Most of his head was gone when he died. What could make someone act like that?
>  
> **<End Log>**
> 
> **Closing Statement:** D-1366 was given a Class-C amnesiac immediately following the interview. No long-term psychological impact has been observed.

> Kerry-
> I honest-to-God hate you, you know that? You don't know shit about what you're talking about. You don’t understand art and you will never be an artist. Fuck you.
> This is the piece you wanted. I promise you’ll find it more interesting than the last few.
> I'll come by tomorrow to pick up my payment.
> I hope you enjoy it.

> To the Foundation-
> Since I know you’ll get your grubby hands on my art, I might as well address you, too.
> You disgust me. You don’t look for meaning. You don’t see beauty. You don’t care about the “why,” you care about the “how.” Like it’s a drug. You need it. I don’t understand the obsession.
> Your dependance on the “how” makes you bloated. You are lazy. You don’t think, you observe. You don’t create, you define. You categorize. You sterilize. You sit around on your collective derivative ass all day and destroy meaning through analysis.
> So, when you eventually do find my piece, this will be a fun one for you. For him, the “why” is the same as the “how.” He stands. He is his own. He is free of definition, and meaning does not burden him; it gives him strength. There’s no more understanding to be had.
> You do not stand as he stands. You are not free.
> You will never be cool, and you will never understand true meaning.
> I weep for you.
