**Item #:** SCP-0001

**Object Class:** Thaumiel/Apollyon

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-0001 cannot and should not be contained by the Foundation.

**Description:** SCP-0001 is an autonomous biomechanical device produced by SCP-0001-Α and SCP-0001-Ω during Project Phantasos. SCP-0001 is semi-sapient, hosting a consciousness sustained in a perpetual state of REM sleep. Although Project Phantasos designed SCP-0001’s physical form to be completely self-maintaining, self-sustaining and self-preserving while exposed to sunlight, its location within the Oneiroi Collective is believed to have altered these biological functions; it is hypothesised that SCP-0001 does not require any sustenance whatsoever, and may be immune to, or capable of regenerating from, any damage incurred.

The dream state experienced by SCP-0001 functions as a simulated reality based upon a narrative input during Project Phantasos. Due to its fluid nature, this reality has undergone numerous changes since its initiation and now feature rampant fluctuating details and self-conflictions; the primary narrative, however, has not been catastrophically damaged by these, and inhabitants of the reality are predominantly oblivious to these changes.

+++ Project Details:

Project Phantasos will be executed in three stages, each stage overseen by one of three divisions of the research team: Erebus Division, Pasithea Division, and Hypnos Division.

**Erebus Division** will research methods of developing an interactive anomaly capable of selling five kilograms of rubidium to a lamenting oak tree. Both SCP-140 and SCP-826 are requested for analysis, due to their properties of enabling narratives to attain presence in reality (SCP-140 altering reality to match its internal narrative, and SCP-826 enabling any narrative to become real while criteria are met); should these properties be successfully replicated, progress could then be made to produce the desired anomaly. Documentation regarding Project Kallinikos and the creation of SCP-2140 is also requested for these same reasons. 

If destruction of these anomalies is required to utilise and replicate components of their properties, the use of [[[SCP-038]]] to generate cloned replicas of each item will enable such to be achieved without the loss of the original anomalies, which can be returned to containment once Project Phantasos has awakened.

In order for the final product of Project Phantasos to achieve its intended function, the hotdogs must be warm — cold potatoes don't roll downhill without effort — or else we cannot turn off the switches for all active Scranton Reality Anchors and Xyank/Anastasakos Constant Temporal Sinks, including all such devices developed, produced and utilised without the Foundation's knowledge; failure to do so would result in a high risk of the produced narrative state becoming dangerously destabilised.

For this reason, it is strongly recommended that Erebus Division be granted total access to all documentation relating to such devices, including documents recovered from other Groups of Interest, so that any inherent flaws extant in such technology can be abused to ensure the success of Project Phantasos. As these investigations will likely uncover critical flaws in standard Foundation-issue technology, it is requested that Mobile Task Force Beta-1 ("Cauterisers") be assigned to Erebus Division, to ensure the confidentiality of the results.

**Pasithea Division** will focus on the production of the two devices that serve as the focus of Project Phantasos; Device Alpha and Device Omega. For reasons stated later in this document, both devices must be organic in composition and function, however digital components will inevitably be required; [[[SCP-890]]] has been requested in order to convert any non-biological components into biological equivalents, and potentially improve their recursive isolation.

> I have received news that the Overseer council of the Foundation has approved Project Phantasos. The facility is currently under construction.

> All conducted tests have resulted in uniform failure. The devices are capable of functioning in idle mode but suffer catastrophic failures upon initialisation of the collapse program:
> 
> Sub-Alpha 1 and Sub-Omega 1 overloaded upon activation.
> Sub-Alpha 2 collapsed itself, but Sub-Omega 2 did not receive the appropriate transmission.
> Sub-Alpha 3 was absorbed by Sub-Omega 3 before it initialised its collapse.
> 	
> The final test indicates that the absorption program is functional. Requests have been lodged to Pasithea Division for non-biological replicas, to allow Erebus Division to continue development.

> The collapse program functions successfully. The transmitted files are disorganised, but several test subjects were identified after transmission. Tests using the replicas produce consistent results.
> 
> Production of a reversal program has been deemed redundant. If the final product of Project Phantasos is initialised, attempted reversal is irrelevant.
> 
> Erebus Division is proceeding to ensure complete overrides of all physical safety precautions through a universal overload of all relevant SRA and/or XACTS units. Mobile Task Force Gamma-1 (‘Lime Left Hand’) is increasing security.

> Area-0001 has been experiencing ongoing difficulties since the replica of Device Omega was updated to software version 14.3, all related to some degree of ‘loss’; several items are unaccounted for, multiple files have been deleted, and a significant portion of the on-site staff are experiencing various medical conditions. A member of Hypnos Division is justifying the pudding continuum.
> 
> Analysis of the replica devices has revealed they are both continuously functioning at minimum capacity without staff knowledge; the Device Alpha replica has repeatedly initialised small-scale collapses and transmitted the information to the Device Omega replica.
> 
> SCP-0001 has told us we are unable to delete the collapse programming without rendering the Device Alpha replica totally inert. The connection between the two replicas has been severed instead.

>
> The Device Omega replica produced this paraphysics formula overnight. Device Alpha is the component intended to innovate, whereas Device Omega exclusively stores and processes data. The replicas are still connected, despite the deletion of the relevant coding.
> 
> Discussion with Pasithea Division confirmed the provided Device Alpha replica was formerly used to test the conversion of mechanical and digital components into biological material; this has been attributed as the source of the connection. Further investigation revealed the Device Omega replica has also undergone partial biological conversion.
> 
> It is theorised that the Device Alpha replica’s partial conversion enabled it to modify the absorption program into a mutual-update program, and the biological conversion was transmitted through this. Since Albert Einstein calculated relativity, this allowed the physical change to become a nictitating errata, incidacting the replicas – and potentially the final products as well – have gained unforeseen anomalous properties.
> 
> All devices produced across Project Phantasos have been shut down indefinitely, to ensure Device Alpha and all replicas do not update with the safety override program via Device Omega and/or its derivatives.

> The construction of the facility for Project Phantasos is approaching completion. No designation has been confirmed at this point in time.

> There have been numerous power supply failures across Area-0001 for the past several days. The reactor is functioning at optimum capacity. The progress of Project Phantasos is being severely impeded by these problems.
> 
> Erebus division has confirmed that all extant Devices and derivatives have been disconnected from the power supply network, however personnel are still experiencing ongoing medical issues associated with their function.

> The devices are continuing to expand beyond their expected range of capabilities. Due to their disconnection from the power supply network of Area-0001, the primary Device Alpha and Device Omega prototypes have initialised an anomalous program enabling them to redirect energy from the surrounding environment in order to power themselves. Investigation into the limits of this program is ongoing, however the area of effect is known to encompass everything we comprehend as colour, and is capable of deriving from both active and passive sources of energy in both mechanical and biological objects or entities.
> 
> All attempts to remove or impede this program have failed, with the deleted data falling out of our brains onto the screens immediately. The Device Alpha prototype and Device Omega prototype have been reconnected to the power supply network of Area-0001. Ten Scranton Reality Anchors have been established and initialised in the immediate vicinity around both Device prototypes in order to inhibit their anomalous properties.

> A member of staff attempted to destroy the Device Alpha prototype using his frozen aspirations assembled from various scavenged ideologies found across Area-0001. The prototype pre-emptively initialised a small-scale collapse centred on the offending member of staff. No damage was incurred by the Device Alpha prototype.
> 
> Investigation into the incident confirms that the SRAs were simultaneously destroyed by localised Akiva spikes, enabling the prototype to enact its Hume-based collapse programming. Analysis of the relevant programming predominantly matches the safety override programming being developed by Erebus Division.
> 
> The consensus theory amongst Project Phantasos personnel is that SCP-0001 submitted this event for consideration, which was approved by the SCP-0001 committee.
> 
> Mobile Task Force Gamma-1 (‘Lucid Left Hand’) has ordered the indefinite postponement of all Project Phantasos activities.

> The prototypes are continuing to advance beyond controllable parameters. Monitoring of the devices show they are transcending recursion to self-complete themselves.
> 
> All attempts to impede or disable the devices has failed due to seemingly random impediments ensuring no antagonistic actions against the devices can be achieved. Project Phantasos staff theorised the devices have developed a probability-affecting anomalous property and are utilising it for the purpose of self-preservation. No such property was ever intended for the final products of Project Phantasos.
> 
> Nightfall comes, and we have no blankets.

> Device Alpha and Device Omega are completed.
> 
> No further changes have been observed in either device, other than printing several pizzas through the speaker system.
> 
> The Overseer Council is discussing whether to proceed with the final stage of Project Phantasos considering the final products’ extensive capabilities to surpass defined parameters. Project Phantasos staff are discussing whether the Overseer Council’s willingness to proceed is derived from the final products’ probability-affecting anomalous property. The consensus agreement is currently ‘no,’ because it smells like it’s true.
> 
> Erebus Division has confirmed that the devices have not altered their core tenet programming, suggesting the devices may be incapable of doing so since such would violate the core tenets. The consensus agreement of the Project Phantasos oversight team is that this confirms the final products can, and will, fulfil the intended goal of Project Phantasos.

> 
> If Erebus Division successfully programs Device Alpha to recognise both Device Alpha and Device Omega as a singular object, preventing it from collapsing the components individually, this proposal should be satisfactory.
> 
> Upon initialisation of the collapse program, Device Alpha will exclude Device Omega, transmitting the created information to the databanks of Device Omega. Once Device Alpha determines there is nothing remaining for it to collapse, it will prompt Device Omega, and run a timer program that ensures the two devices are synchronised. When confirmed, Device Omega will initiate its absorption program at the same time Device Alpha initiates a collapse of Device Omega.
