title:TF Alpha-440
**Task Force Alpha-440 (aka "What the hell was that sound?")** is a collaborative operation with personnel from all branches of the Foundation, dedicated to documenting and archiving audio from Foundation incidents, research projects, and operations. Any audio projects, so long as they involve some sort of SCP (including ones not on the main list), the Foundation, or one of the other organizations, are at home here.

As with [[[Foundation Tales]]], if you're going to use someone else's SCP, try and get permission first, but if that's not possible (i.e. the author is either unknown, or not around any more) feel free to use it, but try and stick to the spirit of the SCP.  This also applies to SCP researchers, agents, etc. If you're not sure, ask in [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/realtime-chat the chat].

Remember, the stuff you write doesn't have to be canon to the rest of the site. There is no canon.

When posting audio dramas, do not forget to tag the page "audiodrama".

> **Technical Note:** When uploading audio, please compress to 64 Kbps, which will result in approximately FM Radio quality audio. One minute of audio compresses to a file size of approximately 0.45 MB (about 22:1 compression). It's not as nice as CD quality, but uncompressed audio of any appreciably more space.

+ **Completed Audio Projects**

These works have been completed and are ready to be heard.

When placing the story, put it in alphabetically. If it has multiple chapters, nest them inside the main link. If it's just a oneshot, just do it regularly. If you wish, you can add your name alphabetically to the list of authors. Also, if the story contains themes of an adult nature, put a warning on the front. Just in case.

[[tab Script Templates]]
+ **Script Templates**
Of course people are welcome to write audio scripts however they like, but this is a useful semi-standardized template for a format that is easy for a producer/director/sound engineer/actor to work from.
----
**Example Script Template (Wiki code; copy & paste this into your sandbox):**

@<**Title:** (Work Title)>@
@<**Characters:**>@
@<* (Character A): Brief Description of Character A, including notes for voice actor casting>@
@<* (Character B): Brief Description of Character B, including notes for voice actor casting>@
@<* Etc.>@

@<**Script**>@

@<//(Description of ambiance, i.e. "Sounds of a forest at night")//>@

@<**CHARACTER A:** I say some line of dialogue here.>@

@<**CHARACTER B:** I say something else here, such as replying to Character A, or whatever.>@

@<//(Description of sounds heard, i.e. "A low howl is heard in the distance")//>@

@<**CHARACTER A:** Hey, did you hear that thing that sounded like a low howl in the distance?>@

(This continues)

@<**FINAL NOTE:** An (optional) reference putting context into how the Foundation came to have this recording.>@

@<**End of script**>@

----
**This, of course, would end up looking like this (when formatted):**
----
**Title:** (Work Title)
**Characters:**
* (Character A): Brief Description of Character A, including notes for voice actor casting
* (Character B): Brief Description of Character B, including notes for voice actor casting
* Etc.

**Script**

//(Description of ambiance, i.e. "Sounds of a forest at night")//

**CHARACTER A:** I say some line of dialogue here.

**CHARACTER B:** I say something else here, such as replying to Character A, or whatever.

//(Description of sounds heard, i.e. "A low howl is heard in the distance")//

**CHARACTER A:** Hey, did you hear that thing that sounded like a low howl in the distance?

(This continues)

**FINAL NOTE:** An (optional) reference putting context into how the Foundation came to have this recording.

**End of script**

+ **Works In Progress**

**__THIS IS NOT THE LOCATION TO POST THE WORKS THEMSELVES, RATHER, JUST POST LINKS TO YOUR AUDIO SANDBOX! ALSO, DON'T USE THE MAIN WIKI FOR INCOMPLETE WORKS; USE [[[http://scpsandboxwiki.wikidot.com/ | A SANDBOX]]] INSTEAD.__**

Unlike writing an SCP or a Foundation Tale, audio projects are often collaborative efforts that require a number of people (writer, director, sound engineer, voice actors, SFX (sound effects) creator). If you're working on something, use this as an index for your project. //(This assumes you're a writer in search of assistance; if you are instead a sound engineer, voice actor, SFX artist, or the like, go to the "Volunteers" tab.)// Please place your name in alphabetical order.

Similarly, partial audio clips (such as lines read by a particular individual for a given work) should be uploaded to the writer's sandbox page. **Do not upload such audio clips to this page.**
