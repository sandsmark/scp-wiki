Record of observations made from [[[SCP-709]]]

Please include your name, the date and initial time of observation, and the length of time spent observing.

**Name:** Agent Talmor
**Date:** 04/01/2009
**Time:** 23:15 approx.
**Duration:** 20 minutes approx.
**Observed:** A family of raccoons playing in the snow, wearing mittens and boots. They made and threw snowballs, built a snow raccoon, and otherwise engaged in normal winter play.

**Name:** Agent Thompson
**Date:** 06/01/2009
**Time:** 19:30
**Duration:** 23 minutes 
**Observed:** Several species of wildlife including: bears, deer, wolves, birds, sheep, raccoons and squirrels (all of which were bipedal) engaged in warfare, using current day automatic weapons and several futuristic laser cannons.

**Name:** Dr. █████
**Date:** 01/08/████
**Time:** 12:00
**Duration:** 30 minutes 
**Observed:**  
# Large tree-like being which moved a total of four feet during observation.  Appeared to wave "branches" several times, and [DATA EXPUNGED].
# A large viper-like lizard, with gliding wings that appear to be part of the rib cage.
# A small family of grizzly bears, which appear to have tongues similar to those of the chameleon, as well a second set of limbs mid-way down the rib cage.
# [DATA EXPUNGED] aware of observation.  Level of awareness appears to be minimal, and the subject's physical dimensions limit any possibility of interaction.

**Name:** Agent CarrionTrooper
**Date:** 10/07/2009
**Time:** 09:10 approx.
**Duration:** 50 minutes approx.
**Observed:** Velociraptors hunting a Parasaurolophus. They used obsidian knifes to butcher the meat, and carried bag-like containers where they put the rest of the meat in. They left the scene after butchering the Parasaurolophus. Shortly after they left, small unidentified dinosaurs scurried to the carcass and ate bits of it.

**Name:** Agent Hunter and a videocamera
**Date:** 05/17/2009
**Time:** 17:10 approx.
**Duration:** ca. 45 minutes
**Observed:** [Agent] At first a child was seen flying about on a rocking horse, chased by what appeared to be a "small friendly flock of bird". The birds did not match any native species. After they had flown, several trees were seen to fall, despite not hearing a sound that could explain their fall. Finally, a herd of "miniature elephants" the size of ponies walked past.

[Camera] The camera did not record anything. To be more precise, what it recorded appears to have been a single still image (it includes at least two birds in mid-flight), accompanied with the normal sounds of a forest.

**Name:** Dr. Light
**Date:** 08/10/2009
**Time:** 8:30 
**Duration:** 60 minutes approx.
**Observed:** A single organism of variable size and shape, which emerged from a nearby body of water and proceeded, over the following hour, to recreate the stages of human evolution. It began as an early amphibian, and slowly began to grow legs, arms, fur, teeth, becoming bipedal, and using sticks as tools. Once the organism reached the current stage of human development, it continued developing for approximately five minutes (gaining longer fingers and toes and larger eyes, while diminishing in stature) until it was abruptly consumed by what appeared to be "a very fast, very large [[[SCP-682]]]." 
Dr. Light notes that while slightly disturbing, the process was "scientifically fascinating, and I wish I could have recorded it."

**Name:** Dr. Garcia
**Date:** 11/11/2010
**Time:** 14:45 
**Duration:** 25 minutes approx.
**Observed:**  Environment appears to be flooded, to a depth greatly exceeding the altitude of the observation position, with a fluid (inferred to consist of liquid methane, based on ████████████████████).  Neither the surface nor the bottom of the "sea" could be observed, and lighting conditions were very poor.  A group of manta ray-like bioluminescent organisms, each exceeding 40 meters in body length, swam past the observation point at one point.

**Name:** Agent Poe
**Date:** 03/20/2012
**Time:** 17:40
**Duration:** 15 minutes approx.
**Observed:** A huge and oddly distorted human face that emerged from just above the viewpoint. It stared directly at the agent for several minutes before [DATA EXPUNGED]. A number of human-like creatures were seen to form out of the remains, all of which seemed to be aware of their observer.

**Name:** Dr. Chesnokov
**Date:** 05/15/2012
**Time:** 12:12 
**Duration:** 38 minutes approx.
**Observed:**  A single male //Pan troglodytes// (common chimpanzee) appeared from the south-west, into the view of the observation point, carrying the following:

* █████ █████-brand smoothie cup, in left hand, with a violet liquid visible through transparent straw.
* Nondescript smart phone, in its mouth.
* Novel, entitled █████████, under its arm. 

Ckhimpanzee made its way to a tree and proceeded to climb upward until it reached a branch eye-level with observer, approximately 30 meters away, and then sat. For the rest of the event, the chimpanzee stared intently at the pages within the book, occasionally sipping from its smoothie and checking its smartphone. This continued for 37 minutes until he suddenly stood and climbed back down, leaving from where he entered.
