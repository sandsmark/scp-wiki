Record of observations made from [[[SCP-709]]]

Please include your name, the date and initial time of observation, and the length of time spent observing.

**Name:** Agent Talmor
**Date:** 04/01/2009
**Time:** 23:15 approx.
**Duration:** 20 minutes approx.
**Observed:** A family of raccoons playing in the snow, wearing mittens and boots. They made and threw snowballs, built a snow raccoon, and otherwise engaged in normal winter play.

**Name:** Agent Thompson
**Date:** 06/01/2009
**Time:** 19:30
**Duration:** 23 minutes 
**Observed:** Several species of wildlife including: bears, deer, wolves, birds, sheep, raccoons and squirrels (all of which were bipedal) engaged in warfare, using current day automatic weapons and several futuristic laser cannons.

**Name:** Dr. █████
**Date:** 01/08/████
**Time:** 12:00
**Duration:** 30 minutes 
**Observed:**  
# Large tree-like being which moved a total of four feet during observation.  Appeared to wave "branches" several times, and [DATA EXPUNGED].
# A large viper-like lizard, with gliding wings that appear to be part of the rib cage.
# A small family of grizzly bears, which appear to have tongues similar to those of the chameleon, as well a second set of limbs mid-way down the rib cage.
# [DATA EXPUNGED] aware of observation.  Level of awareness appears to be minimal, and the subject's physical dimensions limit any possibility of interaction.

**Name:** Agent CarrionTrooper
**Date:** 10/07/2009
**Time:** 09:10 approx.
**Duration:** 50 minutes approx.
**Observed:** Velociraptors hunting a Parasaurolophus. They used obsidian knifes to butcher the meat, and carried bag-like containers where they put the rest of the meat. They left the scene after butchering the Parasaurolophus. Shortly after they left, small unidentified dinosaurs scurried to the carcass and ate bits of it.

**Name:** Agent Hunter and a videocamera
**Date:** 05/17/2009
**Time:** 17:10 approx.
**Duration:** ca. 45 minutes
**Observed:** [Agent] At first a child was seen flying about on a rocking horse, chased by what appeared to be a "small friendly flock of bird". The birds did not match any native species. After they had flown, several trees were seen to fall, despite not hearing a sound that could explain their fall. Finally, a herd of "miniature elephants" the size of ponies walked past.

[Camera] The camera did not record anything. To be more precise, what it recorded appears to have been a single still image (it includes at least two birds in mid-flight), accompanied with the normal sounds of a forest.

**Name:** Dr. Light
**Date:** 08/10/2009
**Time:** 8:30 
**Duration:** 60 minutes approx.
**Observed:** A single organism of variable size and shape, which emerged from a nearby body of water and proceeded, over the following hour, to recreate the stages of human evolution. It began as an early amphibian, and slowly began to grow legs, arms, fur, teeth, becoming bipedal, and using sticks as tools. Once the organism reached the current stage of human development, it continued developing for approximately five minutes (gaining longer fingers and toes and larger eyes, while diminishing in stature) until it was abruptly consumed by what appeared to be "a very fast, very large [[[SCP-682]]]." 
Dr. Light notes that while slightly disturbing, the process was "scientifically fascinating, and I wish I could have recorded it."

**Name:** Dr. Garcia
**Date:** 11/11/2010
**Time:** 14:45 
**Duration:** 25 minutes approx.
**Observed:**  Environment appears to be flooded, to a depth greatly exceeding the altitude of the observation position, with a fluid (inferred to consist of liquid methane, based on ████████████████████).  Neither the surface nor the bottom of the "sea" could be observed, and lighting conditions were very poor.  A group of manta ray-like bioluminescent organisms, each exceeding 40 meters in body length, swam past the observation point at one point.

**Name:** Agent Poe
**Date:** 03/20/2012
**Time:** 17:40
**Duration:** 15 minutes approx.
**Observed:** A huge and oddly distorted human face that emerged from just above the viewpoint. It stared directly at the agent for several minutes before [DATA EXPUNGED]. A number of human-like creatures were seen to form out of the remains, all of which seemed to be aware of their observer.

**Name:** Dr. Chesnokov
**Date:** 05/15/2012
**Time:** 12:12
**Duration:** 38 minutes approx.
**Observed**: A single male Pan troglodytes (common chimpanzee) appeared from the south-west, into the view of the observation point, carrying the following:
* █████ █████-brand smoothie cup, in left hand, with a violet liquid visible through transparent straw.
* Nondescript smart phone, in its mouth.
* Novel, entitled █████████, under its right arm.

Chimpanzee made its way to a tree and proceeded to climb upward until it reached a branch eye-level with observer and approximately 30 meters away, before sitting. For the rest of the event, the chimpanzee stared intently at the pages within the book, occasionally sipping from its smoothie and checking its smartphone. This continued for 37 minutes until he suddenly stood and climbed back down, leaving from where he entered.

**Name:** Researcher Charon
**Date:** 06/05/2012
**Time:** 11:32
**Duration:** 23 minutes approx.
**Observed:** A group of five  Suricata suricatta (meerkat), riding an assortment of four wheeled vehicles, similar to "quad-runners". All were wearing leather vests, on the backs of which were embroidered  a large sun in the middle with a halo on top, the words "Sun Angels" surrounding. Coordinating via unintelligible chirrups and barks, they seemed to be searching for something. After about 10 minutes, they formed a large circle, dismounted their vehicles, and began moving inward. When the circle was about 25 meters in diameter, something sprang from the under brush at about the center, and tried to escape. After turning around and seeing that it was surrounded, it tried to make a last stand. The central figure looked like a wolf hominid. The five clan members closed in and eviscerated the wolf creature using their long claws, claiming victory when one of the clan held the wolf's head aloft.
A visibly shaken Researcher Charon noted: "I'm never going to be able to watch The Lion King after //THAT!//"

**Name:** Dr. Zara
**Date:** 04/10/2012
**Time:** 11:17
**Duration:** 45 minutes approx.
**Observed:** Plant life unchanged. Fauna not visible, except for a single, very large horse slowly trekking to the west. Atmospheric dimming suggests horse to be at least twenty kilometers away and more than five kilometers in height.

**Name:** Dr. E. A. D.
**Date:** 09/25/2012
**Time:** 14:22
**Duration:** 32 minutes approx.
**Observed:** A bio-luminescent fungus in an otherwise poorly-lit environment. Other flora appeared twisted, and four distinct varieties of trees were observed, none native to Earth. Furthermore, one tree reminiscent of [[[SCP-143]]] was observed moving seemingly of its own volition to decapitate a skeletal humanoid barely within the range of the glowing fungus.

**Name:** Researcher Ford
**Date:** 12/10/2012
**Time:** 13:13
**Duration:** 10 min approx.
**Observed:** Researcher Ford looked thoroughly confused upon exiting the tree house. He then explained that he had seen four men in lumberjack attire gathered around a log. None of the men had any apparent facial features. One carried a trumpet that appeared to be made of brass, and was holding it next to where a mouth would be. Another was dribbling a basketball between both his hands. The third carried a birdcage containing a gray bird similar to a pigeon. The last had a jar of peanut butter and a plastic knife that it was using to butter the log. Researcher Ford was oddly concerned with the fact that the peanut butter jar didn't seem to run out even after ten minutes of spreading it on the log. This was noted as within normal parameters and did not warrant any psychological testing.
