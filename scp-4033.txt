**Item #:** SCP-4033

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4033 is currently held at Site-██ in a padlocked glass container. When handling the object, 0.5 centimetre rubber gloves are to be worn at all times. --No direct contact with SCP-4033 is permitted unless conducting a test.-- No more tests including SCP-4033 are to be conducted under order from O5 Command.

**Description:** SCP-4033 is a Cadbury's 'Crème Egg' that cannot be cracked, melted, eaten or damaged in any other way. If a subject touches SCP-4033through skin contact, the subject will hear a voice. No others have reported hearing the voice, hereby referred to as SCP-4033-1.

SCP-4033-1 has been reported to have a noticeable lisp and resembles a child's TV show mascot. When activated, SCP-4033-1 will say: '//Hooray! You want to join in my Easter Egg hunt! I see you've found the first one already, so hurry on! Time is of the essence!//'

A painted egg will then appear somewhere in a ten-metre radius of the subject, often found in simple hiding places, such as on a shelf, or behind another object. If a subject collects this egg, another egg (hereby referred to as instances of SCP-4033-2) will appear under the same conditions of the first. If a subject other than the one that initiated the "hunt" touches an instance of SCP-4033-2 or SCP-4033 itself, it will burn their fingers, causing them to instinctively drop it. SCP-4033-1 will then say: '//No! You're not part of this hunt! Put that down!//'

There are twelve instances of SCP-4033-2 in one "hunt", and subjects are allocated ten minutes to collect all of these instances in order to "win". When the "hunt" is over, all collected instances of SCP-4033-2 will spontaneously disappear.

If the subject "wins" , SCP-4033-1 will say: '//Yay! Yay! Yay! You found them all! That means you get the GRAND PRIZE!//' The "winning" subject will then fall unconscious. Medical examination of these subjects reveals that their stomachs are anomalously filled with a substance very similar to Cadbury's chocolate. While all winners have become severely ill and reported extreme pain, none have died.

If the subject "loses", SCP-4033-1 will say: '//Oh no... You didn't get all the eggs. Oh well, don't worry! You get the runner-up prize!//' The subject will then undergo severe brain trauma and physical distress, while still remaining conscious. They will retain basic motor functions and the ability to speak and die approximately 2 minutes later. Autopsies have revealed these subjects to have a [DATA EXPUNGED] in their brains. 

Only one full interview has been successfully carried out with SCP-4033-1; following Incident-4033-A, no more interviews are to be conducted.

**Discovery:** Local Agents situated in ██████, █████ were alerted to 3 mortalities in ██████ Hospital, all dead were found to have [EXPUNGED] in their brains. SCP-4033 was found in the house of a local artist, who was found in extreme distress. They were later found to have a substance resembling chocolate in their stomach. Agent ███ touched SCP-4033 and successfully completed the "hunt". Foundation backup arrived on scene and retrieved the Agents and SCP-4033.
