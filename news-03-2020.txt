You will notice little '📈' emojis beside some articles. That denotes SCP articles which were under 30 and tales which were under 20 when this edition of site news was posted. Give them a little love! Speaking from personal experience, the most frustrating thing that can happen to an article is not deletion, but stagnating below 20 without any comments. So try to read, vote, and comment on these articles! They're often hidden gems :)

* 📈 [[[scp-4614| SCP-4614]]] ("Microscopic Brainwave Lucid Dream Induced Eating Tardigrades") - It's not so disgusting, when you're accustomed to that. Yes, that implies to eat a big shitload of these, but still. Written by [[*user xeonic]].

++++* Tales
* 📈 [[[disillusionment| Disillusionment]]] - "That period of his life had lasted a mere six years, but it felt like an utter eternity to him. Dancing with women, and men, half his age whilst drinking himself into a stupor, desperately clinging to the days of the yester-years." A new installment for the [[[broken-masquerade-hub|Broken Masquerade]]] canon, written by [[*user Cyvstvi13]].
* 📈 [[[seefood| Seefood]]] - "Normally, I'm more careful about when and where I do it, but I was absolutely ravenous. I hadn't had at a good meal in weeks and I was really craving steak.

* 📈 [[[we-stopped-making-socks-cornelius| We Stopped Making Socks (But What If We Made Something Better?)]]] - "Lenny! Look at these new designs! So I was talkin' to the creatives, and they thought that since narwhal print was doing so well, they ought to make some of other horned animals too." A new installment in the //What a Wonderful World// canon, written by [[*user Ellie3]].
* [[[a-bold-choice| A Bold Choice]]] - "You know my standards, you know how I feel about things, even if you don't agree. But while you're saying I won't want any part in this, you're also trying to convince me to join you. What's the point?" Written by [[*user Calibri Bold]].

Written by [[*user TheHouseOfBalloons]].
* [[[disconnect| Disconnect]]] - "I do not know who you are that reads this. To list those who I feel might eventually set eyes on these pages would become strangely exclusionary to those that actually do that are inevitably not listed here, and so I will refrain."

* [[[a-history-of-the-arcadia-logo| A History of the Arcadia Logo]]] - "Mr. Bushnell likes to say he created it, but really calling him the "founder" is all you need to say." Written by [[*user JackalRelated]].
* [[[alto-clef-jr-doorcrasher| Alto Clef Jr.: Day of the Doorcrasher]]] - "Dealing with full-on robots and androids can be more complicated. They emulate human eccentricities, and some of their programming is predictable, but they're not subject to the same physical limitations. They can be built with stronger frames, tougher muscles or faster reflexes. Maybe their CPU isn't in their cranium at all!" Written by [[*user Tsercele]].
* [[[serus| Serus]]] - Because updates are gud. Still written by [[*user Roget]], with now, the fancy artworks of [[*user UncertaintyCrossing]].
* [[[carnivores| Carnivores]]] - "John and Bailey were seated at a table right in the middle of the restaurant. The couple stared at each other for a moment.

Written by [[*user Nagiros]].

+* Q&A:

++* Q: Can I replace a blurb that you wrote for one of my articles with my own? I'm not satisfied with it.

A: Absolutely. You will always have that option at any point.

++* Q: I noticed an error/typo/incorrect information and wish to correct it. May I?

A: Sure! If the changes are not limited to your own article(s) and/or are substantial changes across multiple entries, you should post in that month's discussion page and then make the changes.

++* Q: I wrote an article and it seems to have stuck. Can I send a blurb of mine to one of the frequent collaborators?

A: Yup! It's much easier if you come to us about it, and it gives you the control over what you want shown on the news page.
