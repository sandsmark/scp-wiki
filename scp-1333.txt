**Item #:** SCP-1333

**Object Class:** Enochian

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1333 is to be contained in the Third Volume of Gaspar's Revenants, a text which should manage to contain its awesome powers.  SCP-1333's energies must be bled off through epic necromantic rituals, orchestrated by no fewer than seventeen dreadlords.  Additional Foundation dreadlords are allowed, permitting that additional necromantic angstroms are recorded by the vociferon. 

**Description:** SCP-1333 is THE SCREAMING MAN! His power is justifiably feared, as a consqusequence of his very presence ushering in the end times.  Should THE SCREAMING MAN ever actually //SCREAM!//, then I fear for us all, for his breaths would shatter the very foundations of the universe. Consult a necromancer for further information. 

Currently, THE SCREAMING MAN'S powers ever be harnessed, he could be an unstoppable tool for --super evil-- super good and not evil.

**Addendum:**
