> 
> **SCP-8231-J:** Okay, first of all, I don't know how to fly! Second of all, you're a monster dressed like a 10 year old kid in a lab coat. I can’t unsee the fucking shit abandoned by god you’ve wrought down there!
> 
> **Dr. James:** You shouldn't swear Mr. T-rex!

> **Dr. James:** I just want to draw on them! You’re being mean again.
> 
> **SCP-8231-J:** Mean? MEAN!? You turned me into an abomination, gave me wings for arms, and they don't even work! I’m tortured by  memories of a life that might not even have been mine. I can't do anything cause these stupid wing things trip me on everything. Not that there’s anywhere to go locked in your dungeon. Are you even really a kid? Why can I talk? WHY DO I EVEN EXIST?
> 
> **Dr. James:**  So... no piggyback?
