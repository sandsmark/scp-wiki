**Item #:** SCP-3649

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Project SKYSCRAPER-31 is to develop methods for the penetration of SCP-3649. Project SKYSCRAPER-32 is to determine the feasibility of alternative means of terrestrial evacuation. Project SKYSCRAPER-33 is to devise a broad range of social preservation and  containment contingency plans for the failure of all other SKYSCRAPER projects.

//19 iterations of SCP-3649 Special Containment Procedures have been archived and hidden.//

**Description:** SCP-3649 is an altostratus undulatus cloud formation that maintains a static position relative to the Earth's surface. All electromagnetic waves and physical matter that pass through SCP-3649 are disrupted to varying extents, ranging from general degradation of radio signals to complete collapse of molecular structures. Collisions between SCP-3649 and mundane clouds result in the former subsuming the mass of the latter.[[footnote]]via a type-4 Hoffman-Ritz process. See: Kassovitz, Lily, Jr. "Aerovores and Itinerant Storms: Adjusting Classifications of Anomalous Nephology." //Foundation Internal Journal of Meteorology// 75, no. 1 (January 13, 2020): 355-391.[[/footnote]] Certain types of clouds motivate notably larger growth than others following this integration process (cumulonimbus variants in particular.) No precipitation has been recorded originating from within SCP-3649.
