**Item №:** SCP-5812

**Anomaly Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5812 instances are fully contained within the Glasgow Necropolis, in the United Kingdom.

Four wide-area Scrantron Reality Anchors are to be placed around the perimeter of the Necropolis in order to ensure the instances remain within.

**Description:** SCP-5812 is the group designation for a series of spectral anomalies confined to the Necropolis. Each SCP-5812 instance is visually humanoid, albeit non-corporeal, and is present for approximately 280 days before it disappears.

**Addendum:** Investigation into the cause of SCP-5812 appearances.

||~ Hypothesised Cause ||~ Correlation coefficient [[footnote]] A value of 1 implies that the two events are positively correlated, i.e. one increasing means the other increases; a value of -1 implies the events are negatively correlated, i.e. one increasing means the other decreases; and a value of 0 implies no correlation[[/footnote]]||
|| Activity of reality altering entities within Glasgow ||= 0 ||
|| Variation in Akiva radiation levels within Glasgow ||= 0.04 ||
|| Variation in Akiva radiation levels in the Necropolis ||= 1 ||
|| Deaths in Glasgow ||= -0.001 ||
|| Deaths in Scotland ||= 0||
|| Deaths in the Glasgow Royal Infirmary (GRI)[[footnote]] The hospital located directly adjacent to the Necropolis[[/footnote]]  ||= -0.02 ||
|| Admissions to the GRI ||= -0.4 ||
|| Scheduled appointments at the GRI ||= -0.01||
|| Emergency surgeries at the GRI ||= -0.2||
|| Births in the GRI ||= -1 ||

The exact cause of the correlation between births in the Glasgow Royal Infirmary and the demanifestation of SCP-5812 instances is currently being researched. 

**Update:** After multiple pregnancies in the local area lasted for over 400 days without parturition occurring, the use of SRAs to contain SCP-5812 was indefinitely suspended by order of the Ethics Committee.

The Special Containment Procedures are to be revised within {{3}} days.
