**Item #:** SCP-550

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-550 is to be kept in a standard-sized cell. Further containment measures are unnecessary. SCP-550 should be provided with a recently deceased human corpse when it is possible to do so. The body should be removed and the cell cleaned 21 days after provision in accordance with Foundation policy on biohazards. Persons handling SCP-550 are to wear the provided chemical resistant gloves at all times. 

**Description:**  SCP-550 is a humanoid figure, measuring 2.1 metres in height and 70 kg in weight. SCP-550 closely resembles a human male suffering from advanced muscular atrophy. Notable differences include the lack of functional eyes or mouth, and abrasive skin. Some skin pigmentation does appear to be present. SCP-550's sense of smell is exceptional, and more than compensates for its inability to see. It has also been able to understand and follow some of Dr. ████'s requests, suggesting that its ears are also functional, although two way communication is difficult at this point in time.

SCP-550 is drawn towards human corpses, especially those in the early stages of putrefaction. If no such specimen is in the vicinity, it will actively seek one out. SCP-550 is capable of assimilating simple molecules (Mr <180) through its skin, either through direct absorption or through a mechanism similar to gas exchange. Its skin is capable of producing secretions that facilitate both processes. Secretions have been found to contain high concentrations of hydrochloric acid as well as various peptides. In cases of extreme malnourishment, SCP-550 has shown to be capable of entering a dormant state or [EXPUNGED].

**Acquisition:** SCP-550 was found at the site of a mass grave in ██████, North Africa. Foundation Intelligence was made aware of stories being passed between local nomadic tribes regarding a "ghûl", descriptions of which had some marked deviations from traditional folklore. MTF Alpha-2 was dispatched with orders to confirm the existence of a potential Euclid class being and to retrieve it on the Foundation's behalf. 

Cmdr. ████████-██████'s subsequent report voiced concerns about the safety of his team, citing the restless nature of SCP-550 and an attack on Alpha-2-1-1 that resulted in severe chemical burns consistent with contact with concentrated hydrochloric acid and basic proteases. Cmdr. ████████-██████ is not able to provide any further details, and Alpha-2-1-1 is only able to recall intense pain before blacking out. Dr. ████ recommended that SCP-550 be treated as Euclid until the nature or circumstances of the attack could be discerned.

**Addendum**: Analysis of SCP-550 skin sample shows the presence of mucosal cells and microvilli, and confirms skin pigmentation as melanin. Dr. ████ requested that a biopsy of major organs be performed under sedation. Request denied following consensus between O5-█ and █ that a biopsy would pose an unacceptable risk to SCP-550. O5-█ suggested and authorized MRI scan without sedation. Scan postponed following Incident SCP-550-I1.

__**SCP-550-I1**__

**Date:**██/██/20██

**Time:**0343

**Description:** Surveillance showed that SCP-550 had remained motionless for several hours. Agent ████████ and Dr. ██████ requested permission to investigate. Permission was granted by O5-█. Surveillance footage shows that standard Foundation procedure was followed up until 0359. Footage from 0400 onwards shows SCP-550 [EXPUNGED]. 

 SCP-550 was discovered by Dr. ████ at 0831 standing in a pool of slurry. Analysis showed that slurry contained traces of both Agent ████████'s and Dr. ██████'s DNA. Along with damaged muscle, organ and skin tissue, the slurry was also found to contain an unusually high concentration of simple amines and hydrocarbons, all of which had particularly low enthalpies of vapourisation.
