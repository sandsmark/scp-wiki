**Item #:** SCP-984

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** The [REDACTED] where SCP-984 is located (hereby Site 48) is currently under the auspices of █████████, a Foundation shell company. The door to SCP-984 is to remain externally locked at all times except during experimentation, as are all stalls in SCP-984. Only Class-D personnel may enter SCP-984 without protective armor and a firearm.

No less than three Level-0 medical personnel are to be stationed at Site 48 at all times. Should SCP-984 become activated for any reason, these personnel must be called to SCP-984 to administer any medical attention to any persons exiting SCP-984.

**Description:** SCP-984 is a public restroom in [REDACTED]. SCP-984 was discovered in 19██, after several cases of rabies were reported at local hospitals despite the apparent lack of any animal responsible. The Foundation was notified, and Site 48 was established to contain SCP-984.

Under normal circumstances, SCP-984’s only notable qualities are that it has been partially soundproofed with commercially available materials. SCP-984 will only display overtly anomalous properties under the following conditions: 
* No persons may be in any open areas of SCP-984. 
* Exactly one stall in SCP-984 must be occupied by exactly one person. The door to said stall must be closed and locked.
* At least one light fixture in SCP-984 must be nonfunctioning. [[footnote]]Upon recovery, three light bulbs were found smashed.[[/footnote]]

Should the above conditions be met at any time, an instance of SCP-984-1 will materialize inside SCP-984 once a person exits a stall. Specimens of SCP-984-1 appear to be large, highly aggressive mammals of varying species. All SCP-984-1 specimens disappear nine minutes after manifestation. SCP-984-1 will not willingly leave SCP-984 for any reason, and will disappear if it is forced to do so.

SCP-984-1 will display symptoms and mannerisms characteristic of a mid- to late-stage infection of rabies. However, unlike most rabid animals, SCP-984-1 will display marked hostility towards humans, particularly any persons who enter SCP-984. As persons in SCP-984 are not typically prepared to handle a dangerous animal, victims are often bit several times before being able to properly defend themselves. In cases where SCP-984-1 is particularly large or strong, it is possible for SCP-984-1 to kill the victim shortly after manifesting.

Should the victim survive being attacked by SCP-984-1, they will experience significant confusion regarding the events that transpired in SCP-984 after leaving. In some cases, victims have neglected to seek medical attention and, shortly afterwards, died of their wounds.
