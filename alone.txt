title:Alone
Have you ever been Alone?  Not just alone for a bit while other are out, or feeling rather isolated at the end of a relationship, but Alone.  That special Alone that you feel at 1:25 in the morning, when the whole world is asleep.  Nobody to call, no real place to go, even the depths of the Internet unable to turn up even a passing conversation.  You suddenly realize how isolated you really, truly are.

The house is louder and quieter at the same time.  You'll catch yourself turning on things just to have light, noise, something to fill the space, and sometimes that can work.  At least, for a while.  Still, that gnawing feeling of Alone keeps creeping in.  You could even consider calling someone you know to be asleep, just to hear the sound of another voice.  After a while, you'll start getting more...alert.

It's the first over-the-shoulder glance that brings it to the forefront.  You'll feel stupid for doing it...but you can't stop it.  Maybe you even justify it by looking at something to the side of you...but you're really craning around though your peripheral vision, trying to see what's behind.  It's so stupid...but it's that itchy spot in your back that does it, you just keep having the weird urge to look behind you.

Keep doing it.

They only take prey when they're Alone.  For some reason, eyes scare them.

Maybe because they don't have any.
