**Item #:** SCP-099

**Object Class:** Euclid  

**Special Containment Procedures:**  SCP-099 is kept in a 77 by 53 centimeter oak frame with sycamore crosspieces.  The frame rests on a tripod-configuration easel with the baseplate suspended 1 meter from the ground.  SCP-099 is covered by a 2 meter by 4 meter dye-free polyester drape that completely obscures the artifact from vision.  SCP-099 is contained in a 5 meter by 5 meter climate-controlled containment chamber with humidity maintained at 50% ±10%, and temperature maintained between 18 and 21°C.  All personnel entering the containment chamber of SCP-099 are required to undergo a decontamination process prior to entering.

**Description:**  SCP-099 is a 77 by 53 cm half-length portrait depicting a woman painted in oil on a poplar panel.  SCP-099 was painted by Leonardo da Vinci from 1503 to shortly before his death in 1519.  It is more commonly known as the Mona Lisa.  While it is accepted by the general public that the painting displayed in the Louvre in Paris, France is the original painting, it must be noted that the displayed painting is a reproduction.  SCP-099 was removed from the Louvre on August 21, 1911 by the Foundation, in an act disguised as a theft.  The effects of SCP-099 were studied for 2 years while a convincing duplicate was made.  On December 30, 1913, the duplicate painting was returned to the Louvre, passing as the original.  SCP-099 remains in the Foundation's possession.  The only visual difference between SCP-099 and the duplicate painting is the eye position (refer to Fig. 1 for comparison) which was done to ensure negation of the effects. This change has gone undetected. (Refer to Addendum 099-A1 for details on viewing digital depictions of SCP-099 before viewing.)

The decision to contain SCP-099 by the Foundation was made after it was noted that a large number of people charged with working on restoration and preservation of the painting were affected by severe paranoia and had developed enochlophobia.  After SCP-099 was taken into containment and tested, it was discovered that viewing the painting in conjunction with less than 1 meter proximity triggered its effects.  Any subject viewing SCP-099 under said conditions reported the illusion that any being or depiction of a being in view was making direct eye contact.  Video surveillance contradict the subjects' claims.  Subjects under the effect of SCP-099 perceive their surroundings in a completely accurate manner, except the position of the eyes of all beings or things are shifted to give the illusion of eye contact.  Facial expressions, body positions, and head angles otherwise remain identical.  

**Additional Information**

Testing has been done to determine the extent of SCP-099's effects.  3 Class-D personnel were exposed to SCP-099 for approximately 6 seconds.  The three subjects were led to a room containing 18 sighted human individuals, 3 canines of mixed breeds, 3 mottled grey pigeons recovered from [REDACTED], and 1 blind human male.  Hanging on the rear wall was a large mirror.  None of the occupants in the room were exposed to SCP-099.  All humans in the room were instructed to avert their gaze from the Class-D personnel entering.

The three personnel entering the room immediately displayed signs of uneasiness.  When questioned about their reaction, all three reported that everyone in the room was staring directly at them.  The three subjects were asked to separate themselves by at least 3 meters.  The subjects still reported that every being in the room was making direct eye contact, including the animals and blind individual.  Observations by Dr. ████, who had not been exposed to SCP-099, confirmed that all non-exposed beings were averting their gaze and not making eye contact.  It should also be noted that it would be impossible for the crowd to maintain eye contact with all three exposed individuals, given their distance from one another.
The crowd was instructed to turn 180 degrees, so their eyes were not visible to the three subjects.  However, the subjects reported eye contact was continuously maintained, as the reflections of the crowd and animals seemed to still be looking directly at them.  When the mirror was covered, subjects reported no eye contact was being made.

The three subjects were removed from the room containing the crowd, and taken to a small room with a 3 meter by 2 meter white projection screen, projector, and three chairs.  Subjects were shown a variety of photographs on the projector, each displaying a human or animal whose gaze was not making eye contact with the viewer.  Subjects reported the images were staring at them.  Subjects were shown a clip from the live-action movie [REDACTED].  Again, subjects reported the illusion of the characters making eye contact.  The same reactions were reported for computer-generated and drawn images of varying degrees of realism.  Subjects were exposed to several dolls, plush toys, taxidermied animals, and one deceased human with eyelids removed.  Subjects reported eye contact from each.  Finally, subjects were exposed to clear glass jars with the isolated eyeballs of various humans and animals floating within.  Subjects reported the disembodied eyeballs still maintained eye contact, despite photographic records showing the spheres having been rotated 180 degrees away from the subjects.
It has been concluded that the change of eye position in the reproduction of SCP-099 has not been detected because of its ability to change the perception of not just living beings, but paintings, drawings, and images.  Therefore, any individuals who have viewed SCP-099 prior to its replacement will still perceive the reproduction's eye position as being unchanged.

All subjects exposed to SCP-099 have not recovered from its effects.  All subjects report the illusion that all things with eyes stare intently at them, be it living being, drawing, painting, or photograph.  The illusion has been reported to extend into their dreams.  Subjects exposed to SCP-099 choose to spend their time indoors, in an environment void of anything resembling eyes.  Subjects have developed severe enochlophobia and are rarely persuaded to leave their living environment.  Subjects also display symptoms of mild to severe paranoia.

**Addendum: 099-A1** It is noted that a small percentage of individuals viewing the digital or printed representation of SCP-099 have reported similar symptoms, affecting between 40 and 75 percent of all beings or depictions of beings with eyes.  These effects subside after 48 hours.
