**Item #:** SCP-339

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-339 is contained at Site 31. The room containing SCP-339 is 5m X 5m X 5m and sound-proofed. SCP-339 is sealed in a sound-proofed container on a 1.5m pedestal in the center of the room. The room is only accessible through an outer sound-proofed airlock.

All personnel entering SCP-339’s holding room for maintenance must maintain absolute silence and wear noise-reducing foam-lined boots, available in the airlock. Regular maintenance of SCP-339 is to occur on the 15th of every month, and consists of replacing the degraded sound-proofed container with a new one.

No one is to enter SCP-339’s holding room for any reason other than maintenance.

**Description:** SCP-339 is a group of tendrils extending off a central mass. It is 53 cm from tip-to-tip, although this is variable. It appears to be made out of rusted copper, but shows a much higher level of durability and independent motility.

Any noise above 8 decibels will cause SCP-339 to become hostile. During this noise and for a length of time equal to 5 times the duration of the noise, any movement within visual range will result in the immediate reaction of SCP-339. SCP-339 will expand by extruding tendrils at an extremely rapid rate, engulfing the moving object. If the object is a living creature, the tendrils will pierce the skin, muscle tissue, and bone, burrowing into the body until movement ceases. If the moving object is non-living, it will be crushed or otherwise rendered immobile. SCP-339 will then return to its base shape and size. At this point, secretions of blood and a slurry of bone and muscle tissue from the central mass are to be expected. Note that all movements of SCP-339 are completely silent, even when interacting with organisms or objects in ways that should produce noise.

SCP-339 constantly produces an aerosolized corrosive compound which is so far unidentifiable due to the rate of molecular breakdown. This gradually degrades any container SCP-339 is placed into, necessitating a double-box approach to containment, consisting of a sound-proofed room and sound-proofed box. The box should be constructed of a specialized zinc-cadmium alloy (339-CA08T), which has proven to be the most resistant against SCP-339's corrosion. This box must be replaced monthly to maintain containment.  All work must be done in absolute silence.

**History:** SCP-339 was recovered in Iran in 1953, during Operation Ajax on the part of the Iranian military. It was found in one of Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadeq's private collections. After the deaths of the Iranian soldiers sent to secure this collection, the Foundation was alerted and took control. SCP-339 was found in a velvet-draped room on a pedestal.

A quote from the Persian poet Saadi was engraved onto the pedestal in Persian: "Nothing is so good for an ignorant man as silence; and if he was sensible of this he would not be ignorant."
