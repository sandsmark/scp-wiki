**Name:** Caterer Tim "Tanhony" Hyne

**Occupation:** Preparation of consumables.

**Location:** Caterer Hyne is currently located at the food preparation area at Site ██.

**History:** Timothy A. Hyne graduated from Oxford University with degrees in Mathematics, Physics and Philosophy. Inexplicably, he then decided to become a chef. Caterer Hyne was the head chef at the [DATA EXPUNGED], Paris for seven years before the restaurant was destroyed during a containment breach of SCP-███. 
He then became a cook at the '██████ Spoon' diner in Florida for two years until it was evacuated after becoming host to SCP-███. 
Caterer Hyne remained homeless for two years until he encountered SCP-███. At this point, [DATA EXPUNGED] despite his grievous injuries, was brought onto Site ██ staff. 
Over the next three years, he made a healthy recovery.
