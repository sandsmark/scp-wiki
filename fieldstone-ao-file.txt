**Anomalous Item File:** AO-042286

**Item description:** AO-042286 is a large pile of rocks that wirelessly transmits documents and image files via unknown means. Transmissions to date have included:

[[include component:author-page
  order=created_at |
  perpage=100 |
  background=yes |
  image=yes |
]]

To date, a large box lined with any material capable of blocking wireless signals has been sufficient to contain AO-019986.

That box is expensive. Dump this somewhere. - L2 Researcher Simpkins
