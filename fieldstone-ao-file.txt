**Anomalous Item File:** AO-042286

**Item description:** AO-042286 is a large pile of rocks that wirelessly transmits documents and pictures via unknown means. Transmissions to date have included:

* [http://www.scp-wiki.net/ethics A quiz featuring a series of increasingly complex and disturbing ethical scenarios.] ("Ethics")

* [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3661 Blueprints for automated surgical probes, apparently designed to **REDACTED** among the civilian population.] (SCP-3661)

* [http://www.scp-wiki.net/parts A handbook for the implantation of human neurological components into machinery designed to **REDACTED**]. ("Parts")

* [http://www.scp-wiki.net/one-breath-at-a-time A pamphlet describing meditative exercises with potentially anomalous side effects.] ("One breath at a time")

* [http://www.scp-wiki.net/an-old-woman-and-her-garden A booklet entitled //Growing Companions from Soil//.] ("An old woman and her garden")

* [http://www.scp-wiki.net/leviathan Security logs from an apartment building.] ("Leviathan")

AO-042286 has stated that it is open to collaboration on projects with Foundation personnel. It has stated that personnel are welcome to approach it "at their own peril," describing itself as "a hot mess."

To date, a large box lined with any material capable of blocking wireless signals has been sufficient to contain AO-042286.

//That box is expensive. Dump this somewhere.// - L2 Researcher Simpkins
