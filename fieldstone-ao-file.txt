AO-042286 has stated that it is open to collaboration on projects with Foundation personnel. It has stated that personnel are welcome to approach it "at their own peril," describing itself as "a hot mess."

To date, a large box lined with any material capable of blocking wireless signals has been sufficient to contain AO-042286.

//That box is expensive. Dump this somewhere.// - L2 Researcher Simpkins
