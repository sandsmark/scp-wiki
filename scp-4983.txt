**Item #:** SCP-4983

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4983 is to be contained in a standard humanoid cell, with the proper furnishings to support a single individual. All physical contact with SCP-4983 is restricted outside of testing.

**Description:**  SCP-4983 is a 65-year-old male of European descent that measures 1.7 meters in height and weighs 64 kilograms. A prominent feature of its appearance is the discoloration of its pupils, indicative of its total blindness. SCP-4983 has the ability to transfer full-body hallucinations to other human beings through sustained direct contact, which it states are its "lost memories." The transfer process typically takes two to three seconds to complete. Individuals who have been subject to this effect have reported that these "memories" lack visual information, but contain all other methods of sensory input. Although SCP-4983 claims to be unable to directly control what memories it transfers, researchers have concluded that these visions are solely dependent on who is being touched.[[footnote]]Based on emotional state, the presence or absence of certain trigger phrases in the course of previous conversation, and current sensory perceptions. Please refer to //Experiment Logs 4983.1-4// for more information.[[/footnote]]

**Discovery:** SCP-4983 was recovered from the northwestern region of the Amazon rainforest, three miles from the village of Shêraa, Brazil. It was discovered by undercover Foundation personnel after reports from the local authorities stationed several miles away from the village mentioned a "John Doe" with no memories appearing within the village. 

**Psychological Analysis:** SCP-4983's refusal to eat, drink, or communicate, as well as its claims of memory loss, have prompted the Foundation to investigate. A final analysis of its psychological state on 7/05/2019 indicate that the subject displays symptoms of retrograde amnesia, as well as schizoid personality disorder.

= **MEMORY LOG**
-----
**Opening Statement:** The following document was written by Dr. Collins after he initially interacted with SCP-4983.
-----

**[BEGIN LOG]**

//The memory begins completely black. The air smells of burning wood with a hint of general musk from the outside forest. I can feel a small hand grabbing onto my left forearm. The hand is gently pulling me down, almost forcing me to lean or fall towards the ground. My heart seems heavy, and I can almost feel every beat as it pumps through me. What is happening?//

    "Obidiah, tell me a story." 

//I hear a young girl's voice call out from below me. It sounds like she can't be much older than 7. Her voice is familiar, somehow. But now I can almost taste the thickness of the air. It feels like I should know her name by now.//

    "Sh, you speak too loud. You can't know //all// of my stories. How else am I going to surprise you with all the other children?"

    "Aw please? Just one. Tell me just //one// more story."

//The hand drops away from my forearm. I can almost feel her eyes beading into me. Her voice sounds weaker than usual. My hand raises to my chin, scratching at my beard. I can almost feel every old and flimsy hair as my fingers go through it[[footnote]]Dr. Collins does not have any facial hair.[[/footnote]]. I can also feel the grass rubbing against the bottoms of my toes.//

    "Well, I guess there may be //one// story I can tell you."

//I begin to chuckle to myself. I can feel my chest heave itself back and forth softly. I hear every vibration from my throat, almost in perfect clarity.//

    "//Really?// Tell me, please Obidiah."

    "Tell me, little one. Do you know the story of the Viper?"

//I knew that this story was one of my favorites. During my studies of the Shêraan mythology and tales, I was taught this story[[footnote]]Dr. Collins has no prior knowledge of Shêraan mythology.[[/footnote]]. It's one of the reasons why I went to Shêraa to begin with. They let me in, after I promised to help them. The story was the tale of Hikarktre, the ancient demon that constricted the gods out of wrath, granting itself immense power. Hikarktre was vile, an evil being who wanted nothing but the destruction of the world. His continuous wrath progresses the day into darkness. In Shêraan mythology, it made people's spirits turn cold and harsh. The Shêraan village was once greeted by such a wrath.//

//Hikarktre was in need of human spirits in order to pass the ancient gates of Oruthla, the world of the Gods. The gate itself would only allow deities and dead spirits to pass through its chains. Hikarktre knew this; and he would go to any lengths to get past the gate. The demon began a search, going to all of the tribes it could find, trying to find anyone willing to be used as an offering to the gate. Then, the demon came to the Shêraan. It wanted to get into Oruthla, so it asked to bargain with the village. It said that it could help them. The village was suffering from a great sickness. They didn't know how to stop it from spreading.//

//In the end, It received its wish. With the sacrifice of 20 beings, it was able to force the gates open and begin its attack. Thankfully, the attack was not successful. The gods were able to repel the demon from Orthula. But it came at great cost. Hikarktre was able to badly wound Minotros, the ancient god of purity and sun. This wound nearly ended the god's life, but he was saved. In the end, Minotros will never again be able to keep the sun above the  Shêraan's heads forever. The sun, for which they believed to be the reason for their pure spirits, now could turn dark. This darkness allowed for impurity. Hikarktre knew that, and it gave the demon great pleasure.//

    "Remember, little one, you need to know this. If you see it, you must run. If you hear it, you must run. If you feel it, you must run. Never, //ever//, bargain with the Viper..."

//Hikarktre still uses the darkness for his pleasure. He attacks the unsuspecting, hoping to find more sacrifices for his next attempt at getting to Orthula. The demon is relentless. He will try again. But... I can't tell her that. Not right now. It might scare her.//

    "How are you feeling, Shriena?"

//Shriena... this girl has been bedridden for weeks now. The Shêraan people didn't understand what it was. To me, it looked like a seriously rare case of glaucoma or something. Her eyes were nearly blind by this point. The village is hopeful that it will fade with prayer, but I know she has little hope of stopping the disease. It wasn't bad by this point, but it could only get worse.//

    "Okay, Obidiah. I have been told to lay, and hope the Gods favor me in this time of need."

    "You will get better, just give it time."

    "Yes, Obidiah. I pray I will..."

//She won't.//

**Closing Statement:** Dr. Collins has requested an investigation into the girl Obidiah came into contact with. Foundation personnel granted the request on 07/09/2019 and has sent a team to investigate.

> **Interviewed:** SCP-4983
> 
> **Interviewer:** Dr. Collins
> 
> **Foreword:** The following interview was conducted two weeks after Dr. Collins was exposed to SCP-4983. Dr. Collins has been instructed to continue questioning SCP-4983. At Dr. Collins request, the interview was held in a field nearby Site-49. His reasoning's was that the similar environment may help trigger specific memories from SCP-4983. Due to fact that this also removed the risk of bringing a child into a Foundation facility, security personnel accepted the request, with the condition that an armed escort be present. A translator, familiar with the Shêraan language, also assisted Dr. Collins.

> ~~~~~
> **Dr. Collins:** Well, let's start this from the beginning, okay? Shriena, can you tell me a bit about Obidiah here?
> ~~~~~
> **Shriena:** Well... Obidiah was... important, to us. He read many things and told us many stories. Every //pomorfi// [[footnote]]A unit of measurement approximately equivalent to three days.[[/footnote]] he would have us come to him, and he would tell us things about demons, or things about the world that we didn't understand.
> ~~~~~
> **SCP-4983:** I don't remember any of this.
> ~~~~~
> **Shriena:** How could you forget? You told me so many stories. Even when I was on my bed, with the sickness, you spoke about them.

> **Dr. Collins:** Obidiah, are you sure that you don't remember any of your tales?

> **SCP-4983:** That's good...
> ~~~~~
> //Shriena nods.//

    "I have to save that girl. I owe it to the Shêraan people. I have to save her."

//Shriena. I understand now. The reason that you were able to get into the Shêraan tribe. You promised to help them save her, didn't you? She was important, because she was the daughter of the tribes' leader. That's how you got in...//

    "I will save you... I promised I will. These old legs will not stop me."

//How is this going to help her, Obidiah? What are you doing? Where am I? It's so cold... it feels like my arms are about to fall off. Is it frostbite? No, no, I don't think so. This is the rainforest! It doesn't get cold. Besides, it would take longer than that for the serious effects of frostbite to kick in like this. No...//

    "{{Obidiah... are you afraid?}}"

//Who is that? Obidiah, what have you done? Why is it getting colder? The sounds... why does it sound like something else is breathing? It's heavy... maybe labored after following me. Can I escape? No, no I can't. I don't know what, but now there's something in front of me. A tree? No that can't be it... it's too large. It feels rough, like a bunch of rocks protruding out of something. Is it a cliff wall? No... the rainforest isn't mountainous. What is happening?//

    "{{Obidiah...}}"

//Is this thing that's blocking me...? Wait... that isn't what I think it is. Obidiah, please don't tell me that this thing in front of me is...//

    "{{Tell me, Obidiah, what is it that you seek?}}"

//Obidiah, you have to stop. What are you doing?!//

    "Please, Hikarktre. A little girl is suffering. She cannot see. She cannot remember. If she is not healed, I'm afraid that she'll die."

//The thing laughs. It's ominous, and it echoes throughout the forest. Every sound shakes me to my core. I have to run, now!//

    "{{You expect me to listen to you, heal some girl, and then guarantee her life? What do I get in return, Obidiah?}}"

    "I... I do not know. What do you want from me?"

    "{{I do not have unlimited power, mortal. If you wish to bargain, what you ask for must also be what is taken.}}"

    "I accept, Hikarktre!"

//Obidiah... what have you done?//

    "{{Then it shall be. Return, Obidiah, to the village. Once you arrive, you will see that she is healed. I feel generous, so I will allow you this final visit. You have until dawn, then I shall take what is mine.}}"

//Why would you agree to that? You don't even know this girl, and yet you're sacrificing everything for her? Why?//

    "I did it... Shriena. I was able to save you..." 

//I hope... I hope this was worth it, Obidiah. Now run, before it's too late.//

Dear Shriena,
@@ @@
I know that if you get this writing, you will be very confused. I know that in your tribe, they do not have such things as this. However, I have been given this paper in order to communicate with you. I hope you are proficient in your language. I know that Shêraan letters are rarely taught. But, in the event that you are not, I have asked that this letter is sent to your father, who I know is knowledgeable of the dialect. I know that once he sees it, he will gladly read it to you.
@@ @@
It has been a long time since we last saw each other. I am very grateful that the men who have imprisoned me were able to find you. I am also happy to know that my goals of saving you have worked. I did not know it, but I see that your eyes are now healed. You also looked much better than when I last saw you. That truly makes me happy.
@@ @@
I am sure you are still confused. I too am at a loss. All I know is that after you and I touched, I began to remember. Of course, I don't remember //everything.// However, I do remember who you are now. It is a miracle, in all honesty. How I remember is still unknown to me. But it seems like the Viper is not as powerful as your people believed.
@@ @@
I find it funny that it was you who found me. After all, your name translates to "angel" based off the mythological //greghial// in Shêraan writings. It's almost like you were supposed to help me. But, now that I think about it, I guess that would be a bit too easy. Your people do not believe in life being easy, which makes sense.
@@ @@
These strange men... they are very different from your people. I do not understand why they hold me here. I have asked Collins to send me back to your village, but he always says no. Recently I have asked him if I could visit, but he has not responded as of now. But if I cannot come to see you all, do not worry. These men are afraid of me because they do not understand why I exist. They do not understand why I had to save you. Even when I told them how much your people have done for me, and how my father was Shêraan. Really, I do not think they care much about my reasons. I think they are too concerned about Hikarktre, and how they can find him.
