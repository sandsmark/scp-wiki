> 
> **Dr. Gifts:** An interview? Really Ellie? //(Looks down.)// Where did you find an actual tape recorder? And why do you have a microphone?
> 
> **Dr. Gentle:** //(Brandishing an unplugged microphone.)// How else are they going to know who you are if I don't interview you? Besides, it's proper protocol.
> 
> **Dr. Gifts:** I have never known you to prioritise proper protocol.
> 
> **Dr. Gentle:** Gifts, just go along with it. //(Turns on the tape recorder.)// This'll be easy. Now, how long have you been working with the Foundation?
> 
> **Dr. Gifts:** Six and a half years longer than you.
> 
> **Dr. Gentle:** //(Folding her arms.)// That's not a real answer.
> 
> **Dr. Gifts:** This isn't a real interview.
> 
> **Dr. Gentle:** Touché. Your field of expertise?
> 
> **Dr. Gifts:** Theoretical thaumaturgy. Never could get the hang of the practical side. Also, biology.
> 
> **Dr. Gentle:** Why did you join the Foundation?
> 
> **Dr. Gifts:** I wanted to know the truth. Couldn't resist going down the rabbit hole when the opportunity arose.
> 
> **Dr. Gentle:** Your astrological star sign?
> 
> **Dr. Gifts:** You know that stuff is pseudo-science, right? Besides, you already know this; we have the same birthday.
> 
> **Dr. Gentle:** Your job //literally// involves studying magic. Pseudo-science actually works around here. Also, that's Gemini for the record. Hmm... Favourite movie?
> 
> **Dr. Gifts:** Inception. Obviously. 
> 
> **Dr. Gentle:** Let's go deeper. Biggest failure?
> 
> **Dr. Gifts:** That's classified, Ellie.
> 
> **Dr. Gentle:** What keeps you up at night?
> 
> **Dr. Gifts:** Other than your snoring from across the hall? That's also classified.
> 
> **Dr. Gentle:** Favourite memory?
> 
> //(Gifts blushes and looks down.)//
> 
> **Dr. Gentle:** Well? Is that classified too?
> 
> **Dr. Gifts:** //(Looks her in the eyes.)// Meeting you.
> 
> **Dr. Gentle:** //(Smiling and blushing slightly.)// I do believe that'll be enough for the records. Now... //(Fiddles with the tape recorder.)// I'm going to need you to provide more information about your favourite memory.
> 
> **Dr. Gifts:** //(Smiles warmly.)// As you wish.

> [BEGIN LOG]
> 
> **Dr. Gentle:** Is that my tape recorder in your pocket Gifts, or are you just happy to see me?
> 
> **Dr. Gifts:** You subjected me to this yesterday, it's your turn now.
> 
> **Dr. Gentle:** Very well. //(Tilting her head sideways.)// Be sure to get my good side.
> 
> **Dr. Gifts:** I... fine. //(Pulls out and turns on the tape recorder.)// How long have you been working with the Foundation?
> 
> **Dr. Gentle:** Six years, five months and twelve days less than you have.
> 
> **Dr. Gifts:** //(sighs)// Why don't I hate you?
> 
> **Dr. Gentle:** I assume that's an actual question? Am I not the girl of your dreams?
> 
> **Dr. Gifts:** It was //meant// to be a rhetorical question. Now, your area of specialisation?
> 
> **Dr. Gentle:** Retrochronology and retrocausality. With minor studies in practical thaumaturgy.
> 
> **Dr. Gifts:** You can't be studied in practical thaumaturgy if you can't actually do magic, Ellie.
> 
> **Dr. Gentle:** That's why I said minor studies. Come on, get to the juicy questions.
> 
> **Dr. Gifts:** As you wish. What gives you the creeps?
> 
> **Dr. Gentle:** The baby burning statue freaks me out. Also, I'm a bit afraid of Santa.
> 
> **Dr. Gifts:** Favourite film?
> 
> **Dr. Gentle:** IT.
> 
> **Dr. Gifts:** The cinematic one, or the Tim Curry one?
> 
> **Dr. Gentle:** //(Pretends to look offended.)// The good one.
> 
> **Dr. Gifts:** Favourite actor?
> 
> **Dr. Gentle:** Sir Ian McKellen. //(Pretends to swoon)// He can quote Shakespeare at me any day he likes.
> 
> **Dr. Gifts:** What's your boggart?
> 
> **Dr. Gentle:** I... //(Pauses for a second.)// Losing you.
> 
> **Dr. Gifts:** //(Looks down and speaks quietly.)// Favourite memory?
> 
> **Dr. Gentle:** Meeting you. //(Reaches out to hold his hand.)//
> 
> **Dr. Gifts:** //(Takes her hand.)// I think that they've seen enough of us for today, Ellie.
> 
> **Dr. Gentle:** //(Smiling.)// Agreed. This was more fun when I was doing the interviewing. //(Pulls out microphone.)//
> 
> **Dr. Gifts:** Why do you still have that?
