> 
> **Dr. Gifts:** An interview? Really Ellie? //(Looks down.)// Where did you find an actual tape recorder? And why do you have a microphone?
> 
> **Dr. Gentle:** //(Brandishing an unplugged microphone.)// How else are they going to know who you are if I don't interview you? Besides, it's proper protocol.
> 
> **Dr. Gifts:** I have never known you to prioritise proper protocol.
> 
> **Dr. Gentle:** Gifts, just go along with it. //(Turns on the tape recorder.)// This'll be easy. Now, how long have you been working with the Foundation?
> 
> **Dr. Gifts:** Four and a half years longer than you.
> 
> **Dr. Gentle:** //(Folding her arms.)// That's not a real answer.
> 
> **Dr. Gifts:** This isn't a real interview.
> 
> **Dr. Gentle:** TouchÃ©. Your field of expertise?
> 
> **Dr. Gifts:** Theoretical thaumaturgy. Never could get the hang of the practical side.
> 
> **Dr. Gentle:** Why did you join the Foundation?
> 
> **Dr. Gifts:** I wanted to know the truth. Couldn't resist not going down the rabbit hole when the opportunity arose.
> 
> **Dr. Gentle:** Your astrological star sign?
> 
> **Dr. Gifts:** You know that stuff is pseudo-science, right? Besides, you already know this; we have the same birthday.
> 
> **Dr. Gentle:** Your job //literally// involves studying magic. Psuedo-science actually works around here. Also, that's Gemini for the record. Hmm... Favourite film?
> 
> **Dr. Gifts:** Inception. Obviously.
> 
> **Dr. Gentle:** Let's go deeper. Biggest failure?
> 
> **Dr. Gifts:** That's classified, Ellie.
> 
> **Dr. Gentle:** What keeps you up at night?
> 
> **Dr. Gifts:** Other than your snoring from across the hall? Not much. I don't scare easily. 
> 
> **Dr. Gentle:** Favourite memory?
> 
> //(Gifts blushes and looks down.)//
> 
> **Dr. Gentle:** Well? Is that classified too?
> 
> **Dr. Gifts:** //(Looks her in the eyes.)// Meeting you.
> 
> **Dr. Gentle:** //(Smiling and blushing slightly.)// I do believe that'll be enough for the records. Now... //(Fiddles with the tape recorder.)//
