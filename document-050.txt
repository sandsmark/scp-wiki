On 01/██/20██, Dr. Jack Bright was 'given the bird' on his way to the movies by a passing motorist. As is fairly normal for Dr. Bright, he tracked down the owner of the vehicle through the cars license plate, then proceeded to drive the gentleman to suicide via the use of [[[SCP-720]]]. 

While sanitizing the scene, Dr. Bright noticed an unusual monkey statue, but thought nothing of it. He continued on as normal, until, upon arrival at his office, he found the same statue waiting for him. His office had been tidied in his absence, and everything filed away, which came as something of a shock for the naturally messy Dr. Bright.

Upon further investigation, it was found that despite the apparent tidiness of his office, all of his pens had been drained of all but the last bit of ink, and several important documents had been translated into Aramaic. 

Dr. Bright immediately began the usual testing of this new SCP, but found himself going nowhere, until Dr. Rights, as payback for something unspecified, smeared his desk with one half of a compound epoxy, and applied the other half of the compound to his utensils. At this point, SCP-050 vanished from Dr. Brights office, reappearing in Dr. Rights office, where upon 050 began the clean up again.

After several tests, it became apparent that SCP-050 was easily contained, as long as no one outside the Foundation proved to be cleverer then the Foundation scientists. Of course, this led to many of the Foundation scientist seeking to claim the title of 'Most Clever' for themselves.

And thus began the "Great Researcher Prank War of '09."
----

**Memorandum 050-A:** No good will come of this. -- Fish
**Memorandum 050-B:** Lethal pranks are not allowed to be performed upon anyone but Dr. Bright and D class personel. -- O5-█
**Memorandum 050-C:** If any attempt is made by Dr. Kondraki to enter this competition by any means, Site 17 is to be locked down and the doctor himself neutralized by any means available. 
**Note:** //We're still cleaning up the mess at Site 19, and I don't think I need to inform anyone of the potential risk Dr. Kondraki would represent if he were to vie for this "Most Clever" title. The mere idea of a competitively malicious Kondraki is scary enough.// - O5-█

----

**Entry 1:** On █ / █ / 2009, Dr. English re-opened [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/Scp-048 SCP-048] and listed Dr. Bright as the subject of study. The change slipped through the cracks and a few days later, Dr. Bright somehow managed to sleepwalk into SCP-040's containment room and upon seeing the desires in his dreams, SCP-040 changed him into a 52 kg statue of a turnip. The next morning, SCP-050 appeared on Dr. English's desk and the room had been cleaned as usual.
//Note:// Dr. English either neglected or simply forgot to revert SCP-048's files back to being close. The mistake was not discovered and corrected until several days, and several incarnations of Dr. Bright later. - O5-█

--**Entry 2:** On ██  / █ / 2009 Dr. English was admitted to the medical wards with severe abdominal pains. Subsequent testing showed that Dr. English was incubating the larvae of SCP-562. Subsequent reveiw of medical logs also showed that Dr. Dumount had somehow convinced Dr. English to strip naked and coat himself with green jello as part of the medical testing. Instead of curing the infestation of SCP-562 larvae, Dr. Dumount provided Dr. English with a large sugar pill, and a smaller sugar pill. Dr. English was told to take the large pill anally. Dr. English complied.  Shortly thereafter SCP-050 appeared in Dr. Dumont's office. It was later found that a sample of SCP-562's saliva had somehow gotten mixed into several drinks which were placed in Dr. English's cooler.
//Note: At present there is no cure for infection of SCP-562's larvae. Anything toxic enough to kill the larvae is toxic enough to kill the host. Fortunately after eruption no trace of SCP-562 remains in the system ~ Dr. Dumount//--

**Entry 3:** On ██  / █ / 2009 Dr. Rights obtained SCP-050 from --Dumount-- Dr. English. After several days of reviewing security tapes, the events of ██/█ are believed to have occurred as such, although Rights has refused to verify. Using [[[SCP-715]]], Rights acquired several clones of herself before finding one that was willing to participate in the prank. Said Clone was taken to [[[SCP-542]]], who (under Rights' instuctions) proceeded to surgically maim her. The fatally-injured Clone was then rushed to Dr. --Dumount's-- English's medical ward by an emergency medical team (who was also in on the joke). At some point, during the above events, Dr. Rights convinced [[[SCP-347]]] to take part in the joke through unknown means. SCP-347 entered --Dumount's-- English's surgical suite and proceeded to misplace vital instruments and cause machinery to malfunction while Dr. --Dumount-- English attempted to save the Clone's life, under the impression that the real Dr. Rights was dying. When the Clone flatlined, Dr. --Dumount-- English was observed to be under considerable stress, followed by confusion when the clone fully expired, and dissolved into dust. --Dumount-- Dr. English was understandably distressed when the real Rights burst into the medical suite and screamed "SUPRISE!" before being overcome with hysterical laughter. SCP-050 was found in her office later that night.
//Note: "I'm pretty sure that killing yourself doesn't count as a fatal prank." ~ Dr. Rights.//
//Note: Dr. Rights and the SCPs and medical team she used in the course of her prank were subjected to mandatory examinations. It is believed that she controlled the events through various amounts of alcohol, samples of [[[SCP-562]]] mucus she had stolen from Dr. Dumount's office, and small amounts of other drugs and offering various gifts. Dr. Rights is no longer allowed to request sleep aids, specifically rohypnol, from the medical ward anymore. - O5-█//

**Entry 4:** In an attempt to regain the coveted trophy, Dr. English wrote the events of Entry 2 on a sheet of paper and used [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-871 SCP-871] to erase the events from existence. Unfortunately for Dr. English, while the events never happened, this meant that Dr. Agatha Right's prank was played out on Dr. English, rather than Dr. Dumount. Though he did erase some rather embarrassing events from the past, Dr. English did not regain SCP-050.
//Note: SCP-871 is now off limits to all personnel without prior approval from a supervising O5. If you choose to enter this little tirade of idiocy, you can deal with the consequences.// - O5-█

**Entry 5:** On ██  / █ / 2009 [[[SCP-562-1]]], Agatha Right's pet member of [[[SCP-562]]] acquired vocabulary which is generally considered socially inappropriate including ███, ████, ████, Boobies, and Penis. It began to recite these words when in a heightened emotional state. Furthermore it began to request kisses of people with whom in interacted repeatedly. Dr. Rights reportedly cursed and came to Dr. Dumount to request 'some sort of lip condom' because of 'irresistible puppy eyes'. Later Dr. Rights came to Dr. Dumount with some sort of stomach cramps. Dr. Dumount diagnosed SCP-562 larval infestation, and prescribed that Dr. Rights go to a class for safety in sexual intercourse. Dr. Rights was reported to be worried and stressed about the idea of 'puking out babies'. It was later discovered that the inside of the 'lip condom' given to Dr. Rights had been coated with Ipecac, and that Dr. Rights was not, in fact, infested with SCP-562. SCP-050 was later discovered in Dr. Dumount's office.


**Entry 6:** Despite attempts to limit any access to SCPs during the duration of the contest, Dr. Kondraki had apparently already planned for such an occasion. He was seen entering Dr. Dumont's personal dormitory, and replacing an item from his shower with an exact duplicate, before departing. Access to the security camera in the dormitory  was lost at approximately 2:██ PM. At this time, Dr. Dumont entered his quarters dripping with some sort of foul substance, and immediately made his way to the shower. After his shower, Dr. Dumont returns to his main room and is assumed to get dressed. Reports from adjoining dormitories confirm screams of terror and pain, as Dr. Dumont's clothing had apparently caught fire once in prolonged contact with his skin. At this time, [[[SCP-515]]] began to broadcast the footage from the camera to Dr. Kondraki's personal computer. [[[SCP-408]]] revealed itself in a nearby crowded cafeteria, and displayed the live feed of a now mostly naked Dr. Dumont flailing about. Not to be satisfied, an explosion was heard by several researchers during their lunch, later to be confirmed as the long missing [[[SCP-252]]]. It was at this point, that Dr. Kondraki returned to the dormitory, with [[[SCP-285]]] in hand, and held the opposite end to the doctor's ear, with the mouthpiece directed in the general vicinity of the cafeteria. Dr. Dumont appears highly disquieted by the psychic noise, and despite his burns proceeds to curl up in bed and shudder. He was heard repeating 'loudnoise'. SCP-050 was discovered in Dr. Kondraki's administrative offices shortly afterward.
**Note:** //Dr. Dumont's burns have been healing nicely, but I doubt the psychological scarring will fade any time soon.// - Dr. ██████

**Entry 7:** It is April 1st, 2009. Dr. English made a seemingly innocuous comment to Dr. Kondraki about April Fool's Day being the perfect day for a prank. Though he wasn't worried about the thought, it did make him spend most of the day looking over his shoulder waiting to catch someone in a prank. Annoyed that nobody had the courage to prank him on April Fool's Day, Kondraki became distracted by his own agitation and walked into a pit containing [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-761 SCP-761]. Upon hitting the surface of the SCP, he fell through and ended up in an empty containment cell on the floor below. Dr. Kondraki spent 8 hours in the cell before a fellow researcher passed by and saw him banging on the observation window. SCP-050 appeared on Dr. English's desk the next morning.

**Entry 8:** Dr. Bright accesses SCP-705. 705 is allowed access to approximately one hundred pounds of similarly colored play dough. After several minutes 'conversation', the new army retreats to the ventilation shafts. No footage of Dr. Englishes room exists, but several hours later Dr. English stumbles out, covered in little red welts, and red play dough, swearing and muttering. SCP-050 transfers ownership to Dr. Bright.

**Entry 9:** 08:00 hours. Dr. Dumount reported to be whistling while baking a pie. 11:15 hours. Dr. Dumount begins to walk past containment for 070 heading in the direction of Right's office. 11:16 hours. 070 breaches containment. //Note. Dr. Dumount had been responcible for keeping 070 fed. Why there was no food in 070's containment is presently unknown as Dr. Dumount claims to have placed food within the containment// 11:17 070 enters pursuit of Dr. Dumount. 11:20 Dr. Dumount hands pie to Dr. Bright with orders to get it to Rights while he deals with 070. Dr. Bright reports experiencing an abnormal and strong compulsion to successfully deliver the pie, origin at present unknown. 12:00 other SCPs begin to breach containment. All begin to pursue Dr. Bright. Even sentient SCP who are normally non aggressive began to pursue Dr. Bright. 12:20. 070 subdued with soup. 12:30 Dr. Bright continues to flee SCP during extreme containment procedures. heard canting 'get pie to Right, get pie to Right'. 12:40 Dr. Bright arrives at Right's office to find it empty. 13:00 Dr. Bright begins to search for pie while still being pursued by SCP's demanding pie. 14:00 Dr. Bright, worn out, finds Rights and delivers the pie. Rights seems surprised that Dumount was not delivering the pie. Rights apologies for the inconvenience, and tells pursuing SCPs to return to containment. SCPs do so. Rights eats pie. Statue appears in Dumount's office.

**Entry 10** Upon returning to his office on ██ / █ /2009, Dr Dumount was surprised to find the statue replaced with a note, reading: "Wow, seriously? I can't believe no one's thought of this! Also, check.". The statue was later located in the staff locker of Agent Yoric, who had simply stolen it, the cheeky bastard.

**Entry 11** Statue returned to Dumount. Yoric's living space in utter disarray. Note tattooed onto Yorics forehead in Aramaic and in unknown handwriting reads "I must be earned, not taken. Nice try, just not clever enough."

**Entry 12** Dr. Dumount was reported to be 4 hours late for his shift check in, with no reports of anyone having seen him. Fearing an escape attempt a large scale search began. Two hours after that Dr. Dumount was reported hanging upside from a rope tied around his left foot in an infrequently used storeroom. Dr. Dumount was wearing assless leather chaps, and carrying a card requesting a clandestine meeting in the storeroom. While Right's signature on the card was forged remarkably well, the card was still a fake. Dr. Right identified the chaps as a gift she had gotten Dumount earlier which he had reportedly sworn to never wear. Dumount claims that he was forced into them after he had been caught.
Statue appears in the office of Field Researcher Norman

**Entry 13** At 06:35 on █ / █ / 2009, Field Researcher Norman was found hanging from the ceiling of SCP-028's containment chamber by a chain, swinging through it repeatedly. It isn't clear how long he had been there, how he got there or how severely his exposure damaged his mind, but when the medical staff at Site-██ were able to awaken him, he repeated the words "I know" every few seconds until one of the doctors asked what he knew, to which he replied "everything" before passing out. At 19:36, Norman woke up screaming and has not stopped since. Medical staff are unsure when or if Norman will be able to return to work, and classifying him as SCP-028-2 for study is currently in discussion by O5 staff. It has been noted by cleaning staff that they've not had to service Dr. English's office since █ / █ / 2009.

**Entry 14** At 07.50 on █ / █ / 2009, routine cleaning staff discovered a large amount of human semen on the floor of SCP-040's containment unit. Recorded security footage shows Dr English was the last to enter the containment unit at 04.28, three hours previous. After this point, it is discovered that Dr. English was spotted in several other locations on various sites during the previous week. Each sighting was in the general vicinity of the containment of SCPs that either resembles, requires, or //is// a humanoid child of below twelve years. Further investigation has discovered large amounts of human semen either in the containment units of these SCP themselves, or in a viewing area regarding them. Biological analysis has proven that this semen does indeed belong to Dr. English, and he has been taken in for a full psychological profile and therapy.

In unrelated news, Professor K.P. Crow requested the use of several minor SCP regarding his experiments, (//most notably [[[SCP-294]]] and [[[SCP-721]]]//), during his bi-annual tour of the facilities for biological analysis of all humanoid SCP during the week. SCP-050 has appeared in his office in his absence.

**Entry 15** At 01:34 on █ / ██ / 2009, Professor Skali Sharpnose was seen entering into the air-processing area of Bio-Research Area-12. He seems to have distracted the guard by starting a conversation and subsequently performing some form of hypnosis (or simply being long-winded and boring) and lulling him into a sleep-like state. He then entered into the air-processing room and introduced a Class-3 airborne sedative into the sleeping quarters of Kain Pathos Crow. Security footage then shows Professor Skali entering into Crow's quarters wearing a gas-mask and carrying a large portable dog-kennel. He is seen leaving several minutes later and is able to exit the facility without arousing suspicions about the identity of the kennel's occupant. Apparently, most site personnel are simply unable to recognize Crow without his glasses. //NOTE: Surveillance back-track of Professor Skali shows him several days earlier obtaining a cup of an unknown liquid from [[[SCP-294]]], using the input "Amnesiacolada". It is believed that he administered this liquid to Crow while he was sedated.// Upon leaving Bio-Research Area-12, Professor Skali drove to the nearby town of ███████, where he admitted Crow to the "Paws/Play No-Kill Animal Shelter" and scheduled Crow for a neutering surgery. SCP-050 awaited him on his desk when he returned to his office.

**Entry 16** At 3:40 on ██/ ██/ 2009, Professor Sharpnose was conducting research with his assigned research assistant, Dr. Johnathan Vann. However, due to several errors made by Dr. Vann, Professor Sharpnose was forced to stay longer than scheduled, and missed dinner. When he entered the Site ██ cafeteria, Professor Sharpnose found it to be empty, with a tray of food set out for him. Immediately after eating, Professor Sharpnose visited a nearby restroom.

Reports state that several minutes later Professor Sharpnose was found running through the site ██ hallways, with his pants around his ankles and [[[SCP-548]]] on his left buttock. It was later discovered that the restroom in question had 'out of order' signs on every stall except for one, and traces of "Poo-4-You" laxatives were found on the dinner plate used by Professor Sharpnose. He was treated for several cases of frostbit, and SCP-050 appeared on the desk of head research assistant Dr. Gerald.


**Entry 17** At 4:50 AM on ███/███/███ , Agent Bavil snuck into [[[SCP-252]]]'s containment room and removed it from containment and proceeded to place it in Dr. Gerald's office while rigging it so that when Gerald entered his office and sat down he would set off the bomb.
Later that day, just that happened. reasearchers nearby report hearing a "Bang" followed closely by the scream of a surprised Gerald and a thick cloud of pink smoke billowing from his office. Gerald runs out of his office and straight into a Guard who had been on death row for rape. The guard coughs as pink smoke fills his lungs and proceeds to drag Gerald off to a more "private place"
[[[SCP-050]]] is later found in Agent Bavil's quarters.


**Entry 18** At 11:30 pm on ██/██/███, Agent Dmitri is seen exiting his room in full rage, carrying a machine gun. Smoke pours from the open door of his quarters.

Senior Researcher Iceberg is later found to be in possession of 050, proving that a good enough prank will attract 050s attention no matter the target.


.**Entry 19** At 5:20 pm on ██/██/███, Dr. Dumont was seen requesting a disk from Researcher Iceberg. He returned it the same day. At 10:20 pm, Iceberg was seen with a video camera and [[[SCP-113]]]. He proceeded to stand in the middle of the cafeteria, set up the camera, and strip, and then began to poke [[[SCP-113]]] repeatedly, once every minute and 2.2 seconds. The video was later emailed from an unknown account to all personnel above Level 4. Interestingly, [[[SCP-050]]] was in fact found in Dr. Hyrule's office.

Addendum: Dr. Hyrule had checked out a copy of [[[SCP-061]]] earlier that week, and proceeded to obtain a cup of amnesiacolda from [[[SCP-294]]]. Unsurprisingly, Dr. Dumont remembers nothing of these events.

**Entry 20:** At 3:37 pm ██/██/███, Agent Palhinuk was seen by witnesses twirling a pen similar to [[[SCP-287]]] in his had, leaving the vacinity of Dr Hyrule's office.  Three minutes later, Dr Hyrule was reported to have run, screaming from his office in tremendous amounts of displeasure.  Further investigation shows footage of Agent Palhinuk writing down a document on a sheet of paper in an obscure version of upper-class Italian from the 1600's, then preceding to use [[[SCP-294]]] to dispense a cup of brown liquid, after inputting "carbonatedbatguano" on the keypad.  He then precede to deliver the cup and the paper, claiming it to be work-related, reportedly claiming the cup was some root beer leftover from lunch. When translated, the note read "I thought you could use a delicious beverage, so here you go."

[[[SCP-050]]] appeared in Agent Palhinuk's office twenty minutes later.

**Entry 21:** At 1:17pm ██/██/███, Agent Palhinuk was found by Dr.██████ in the mens bathroom rolling on the floor alternately clutching his face and genitals. To the doctors who arrived on the scene it appeared that Agent Palhinuk had been maced at close range in both the face and groin. After dousing Agent Palhinuk's eye's and groin with a counter agent he was asked why he was found in such a condition. Palhinuk replied that he had been steadily hiding more and more of Dr Coleman's cooking utensils over a period of weeks and Dr Coleman had confronted him about it and laughed it off and offered to make a truce with a handshake. Agent Palhinuk then accepted some food from Dr Coleman and was suddenly struck with the need to visit the bathroom, upon reaching the bathroom Agent Palhinuk began to urinate normally before feeling a burning sensation in the head of his penis "Like someone had dipped it in acid." and began to tear up, upon wiping the tears away the burning sensation appeared in his eyes and he was left in a state of agony until he was found later. It was found after analysis of the compound on Agent Palhinuk's eyes and genitals that it was a very refined form of capsicum of well over 7,000,000 scovilles.

Dr Coleman was found to have run a collection of chillies and spices through [[[SCP-914]]] until a clear liquid was dispensed, he then covered his gloved hands with said liquid before confronting Agent Palhinuk over his pranks. Dr Coleman was also seen lacing the food offered to Agent Palhinuk with a powerful laxitive. When questioned why he perfomed such an action Dr Coleman's reply was simply "You do not fuck with my food."

Later that day [[[SCP-050]]] was found missing from Agent Palhinuk's office and could not be located anywhere within the bounds of Site 19. Site 23 then contacted Site 19 stating that an item matching [[[SCP-050]]] had appeared on Dr Coleman's desk. Apparently [[[SCP-050]]] will relocate itself to the place of work the owner considers to be "theirs" rather than an area they may occupy temporarily.

**Entry 22** At 10:25 am ██/██/███, Dr. Coleman returned from a brief coffee break to discover a typed note sitting on his desk, rewritten here.

> Dr. Coleman,
> It seems there was a problem with the  Class-A Amnesiac you requested following your [[[SCP-231]]] assignment. Please hop on the next plane leaving from the site, and wait until someone comes and picks you up so that we can get this all sorted out.
> Cheers,
> O5-███

Despite factual and stylistic errors in this note (Innappropriately informal style, the fact that there is no Overseer 3.14), Dr. Coleman apparently took the note seriously and became highly distressed. Dr. Coleman boarded the next airplane leaving Site 23, which turned out to be a regularly scheduled flight travelling to Site 19.

Dr. Coleman apparently did not realize this until landing, at which point he still waited over eight hours outside the site, before a guard found him and asked him what he was doing. Dr. Coleman soon confirmed that he had never been asigned to SCP-231, and quickly worked out what had happened.

In addition, upon reaching his office at Site 23, it was discovered that the floor of the room (which was over an empty research chamber) had been removed and entirely flooded with a high-strength non-Newtontial fluid. All of the furnishings of the room, including the floor tiles, had been replaced via an unknown method, so that it was not immediatly obvious what had happened.

The conductor of the prank was revealed when [[[SCP-050]]] appeared on the counter of Dr. Light's laboratory in Site 19. It is worth noting that while Dr. Light was temporarily on assignment at Site 23, SCP-050 targeted her primary laboratory, shedding more light on the object's nature.

Addendum:
//Where on earth did you get that much cornstarch?// - Dr. Coleman
//I know a guy. And a cloning tree.// - Dr. Light

**Entry 23** At 9:02am ██/██/███, sounds of a pitched battle were found to be coming from the office of Dr. Light. When security teams investigated Dr. Light was found tied down to the floor, apparently unconsious with a massive contigent of [[[SCP-705]]] including many vehicles and armaments not previously found to have been created by it. After engaging the massed forces of [[[SCP-705]]] and defeating them with the help of a high pressure water cannon the security detail found that some 7 tons of Play Doh had been animated by [[[SCP-705]]] and told to ambush Dr. Light when she arrived at work that morning. The security team also found many military vechicle and armament recognition guides, both fictional and non-fictional, and a collection of items designed for their use but not constructed of Play Doh.

These included the following:
* 1 Gas powered syringe cannon.
* 11 Syringes containing a potent seditive.
* 400 Wire lengths with pegged ends.
* 1 Gas powered piston used to secure the wire lengths to the floor.

Due to the use of the high pressure hose most of Dr. Light's office was irritriably damaged and she was relocated to a temporary office until repairs can be made. The release of the entire event from her sedation to the hosing down of her office being released to all members of Site 17 also coinsided with the delivery of a note to her new office with the words "You realise this means war?" written on it in a handwriting not reconised to staff at Site 17.

Addendum:
[[[SCP-050]]] was later found on the temporary desk of Dr. Coleman at Site 17. Upon being asked how he obtained the 7 tons of Play Doh his response was //"I know a guy, and they have a cloning tree as well, as it turns out."//

**Entry 24** At 5:38pm ██/██/2009, a person matching Agent Palhinuk's description was seen fleeing from a live-fire training facility, away from yells of pain that most witnesses claim sounded like Dr Coleman from the training grounds.  Footage from the facility shows Agent Palhinuk discussing something with Dr. Coleman with a pair of, what appear to be, hand wraps on his palms. He then produced a small water bottle from his pocket, containing a blue liquid inside, showing it to the doctor, then taking a drink.  He then preceded to instruct a nearby Level 2 operative to fire a .40S&W round from a Sig Sauer at the agent's hand.  The Level 2 hesitantly complies, firing at Agent Palhinuk.  The video tape show Agent Palhinuk stopping the bullet with his index finger and thumb.  Afterward, he offered Dr Coleman the bottle, of which the doctor promptly took a sip and instructed the Level 2 to shoot another round at him.  Just as the Level 2 readies himself and pulls the trigger, Agent Palhinuk is seen exiting the grounds just as the bullet passes through Dr Coleman's hand and implants in his shoulder.  Footage of Agent Palhinuk's escape shows the hand-wraps he had been wearing to fall away, only showing a glimpse of something black on his hands.  Coincidentally, [[[SCP-311]]] had been checked out of it's containment box earlier that afternoon.

[[[SCP-050]]] soon appeared on Agent Palhinuk's desk later that afternoon, with a collective of fresh vaccum marks on his carpeting and a notable lemony zest scent in the air.
