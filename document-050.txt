Dr. Bright

On 01/██/20██, Dr. Jack Bright was 'given the bird' on his way to the movies by a passing motorist. As is fairly normal for Dr. Bright, he tracked down the owner of the vehicle through the cars license plate, then proceeded to drive the gentleman to suicide via the use of [[[SCP-720]]]. 

While sanitizing the scene, Dr. Bright noticed an unusual monkey statue, but thought nothing of it. He continued on as normal, until, upon arrival at his office, he found the same statue waiting for him. His office had been tidied in his absence, and everything filed away, which came as something of a shock for the naturally messy Dr. Bright.

Upon further investigation, it was found that despite the apparent tidiness of his office, all of his pens had been drained of all but the last bit of ink, and several important documents had been translated into Aramaic. 

Dr. Bright immediately began the usual testing of this new SCP, but found himself going nowhere, until Dr. Rights, as payback for something unspecified, smeared his desk with one half of a compound epoxy, and applied the other half of the compound to his utensils. At this point, SCP-050 vanished from Dr. Brights office, reappearing in Dr. Rights office, where upon 050 began the clean up again.

After several tests, it became apparent that SCP-050 was easily contained, as long as no one outside the Foundation proved to be cleverer then the Foundation scientists. Of course, this led to many of the Foundation scientist seeking to claim the title of 'Most Clever' for themselves.

And thus began the "Great Researcher Prank War of '09."

**Memorandum 050-A:** No good will come of this. -- Fish
**Memorandum 050-B:** Lethal pranks are not allowed to be performed upon anyone but Dr. Bright and D class personel. -- O5-█
**Memorandum 050-C:** If any attempt is made by Dr. Kondraki to enter this competition by any means, Site 17 is to be locked down and the doctor himself neutralized by any means available. 
**Note:** //We're still cleaning up the mess at Site 19, and I don't think I need to inform anyone of the potential risk Dr. Kondraki would represent if he were to vie for this "Most Clever" title. The mere idea of a competitively malicious Kondraki is scary enough.// - O5-█

**Entry 1:** On █ / █ / 2009, Dr. English re-opened [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/Scp-048 SCP-048] and listed Dr. Bright as the subject of study. The change slipped through the cracks and a few days later, Dr. Bright somehow managed to sleepwalk into SCP-040's containment room and upon seeing the desires in his dreams, SCP-040 changed him into a 52 kg statue of a turnip. The next morning, SCP-050 appeared on Dr. English's desk and the room had been cleaned as usual.
//Note:// Dr. English either neglected or simply forgot to revert SCP-048's files back to being close. The mistake was not discovered and corrected until several days, and several incarnations of Dr. Bright later. - O5-█

--**Entry 2:** On ██  / █ / 2009 Dr. English was admitted to the medical wards with severe abdominal pains. Subsequent testing showed that Dr. English was incubating the larvae of SCP-562. Subsequent reveiw of medical logs also showed that Dr. Dumount had somehow convinced Dr. English to strip naked and coat himself with green jello as part of the medical testing. Instead of curing the infestation of SCP-562 larvae, Dr. Dumount provided Dr. English with a large sugar pill, and a smaller sugar pill. Dr. English was told to take the large pill anally. Dr. English complied.  Shortly thereafter SCP-050 appeared in Dr. Dumont's office. It was later found that a sample of SCP-562's saliva had somehow gotten mixed into several drinks which were placed in Dr. English's cooler.
//Note: At present there is no cure for infection of SCP-562's larvae. Anything toxic enough to kill the larvae is toxic enough to kill the host. Fortunately after eruption no trace of SCP-562 remains in the system ~ Dr. Dumount//--

**Entry 3:** On ██  / █ / 2009 Dr. Rights obtained SCP-050 from --Dumount-- Dr. English. After several days of reviewing security tapes, the events of ██/█ are believed to have occurred as such, although Rights has refused to verify. Using [[[SCP-715]]], Rights acquired several clones of herself before finding one that was willing to participate in the prank. Said Clone was taken to [[[SCP-542]]], who (under Rights' instuctions) proceeded to surgically maim her. The fatally-injured Clone was then rushed to Dr. --Dumount's-- English's medical ward by an emergency medical team (who was also in on the joke). At some point, during the above events, Dr. Rights convinced [[[SCP-347]]] to take part in the joke through unknown means. SCP-347 entered --Dumount's-- English's surgical suite and proceeded to misplace vital instruments and cause machinery to malfunction while Dr. --Dumount-- English attempted to save the Clone's life, under the impression that the real Dr. Rights was dying. When the Clone flatlined, Dr. --Dumount-- English was observed to be under considerable stress, followed by confusion when the clone fully expired, and dissolved into dust. --Dumount-- Dr. English was understandably distressed when the real Rights burst into the medical suite and screamed "SUPRISE!" before being overcome with hysterical laughter. SCP-050 was found in her office later that night.
//Note: "I'm pretty sure that killing yourself doesn't count as a fatal prank." ~ Dr. Rights.//
//Note: Dr. Rights and the SCPs and medical team she used in the course of her prank were subjected to mandatory examinations. It is believed that she controlled the events through various amounts of alcohol, samples of [[[SCP-562]]] mucus she had stolen from Dr. Dumount's office, and small amounts of other drugs and offering various gifts. Dr. Rights is no longer allowed to request sleep aids, specifically rohypnol, from the medical ward anymore. - O5-█//

**Entry 4:** In an attempt to regain the coveted trophy, Dr. English wrote the events of Entry 2 on a sheet of paper and used [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-871 SCP-871] to erase the events from existence. Unfortunately for Dr. English, while the events never happened, this meant that Dr. Agatha Right's prank was played out on Dr. English, rather than Dr. Dumount. Though he did erase some rather embarrassing events from the past, Dr. English did not regain SCP-050.
//Note: SCP-871 is now off limits to all personnel without prior approval from a supervising O5. If you choose to enter this little tirade of idiocy, you can deal with the consequences.// - O5-█

**Entry 5:** On ██  / █ / 2009 [[[SCP-562-1]]], Agatha Right's pet member of [[[SCP-562]]] acquired vocabulary which is generally considered socially inappropriate including ███, ████, ████, Boobies, and Penis. It began to recite these words when in a heightened emotional state. Furthermore it began to request kisses of people with whom in interacted repeatedly. Dr. Rights reportedly cursed and came to Dr. Dumount to request 'some sort of lip condom' because of 'irresistible puppy eyes'. Later Dr. Rights came to Dr. Dumount with some sort of stomach cramps. Dr. Dumount diagnosed SCP-562 larval infestation, and prescribed that Dr. Rights go to a class for safety in sexual intercourse. Dr. Rights was reported to be worried and stressed about the idea of 'puking out babies'. It was later discovered that the inside of the 'lip condom' given to Dr. Rights had been coated with Ipecac, and that Dr. Rights was not, in fact, infested with SCP-562. SCP-050 was later discovered in Dr. Dumount's office.


**Entry 6:** Despite attempts to limit any access to SCPs during the duration of the contest, Dr. Kondraki had apparently already planned for such an occasion. He was seen entering Dr. Dumont's personal dormitory, and replacing an item from his shower with an exact duplicate, before departing. Access to the security camera in the dormitory  was lost at approximately 2:██ PM. At this time, Dr. Dumont entered his quarters dripping with some sort of foul substance, and immediately made his way to the shower. After his shower, Dr. Dumont returns to his main room and is assumed to get dressed. Reports from adjoining dormitories confirm screams of terror and pain, as Dr. Dumont's clothing had apparently caught fire once in prolonged contact with his skin. At this time, [[[SCP-515]]] began to broadcast the footage from the camera to Dr. Kondraki's personal computer. [[[SCP-408]]] revealed itself in a nearby crowded cafeteria, and displayed the live feed of a now mostly naked Dr. Dumont flailing about. Not to be satisfied, an explosion was heard by several researchers during their lunch, later to be confirmed as the long missing [[[SCP-252]]]. It was at this point, that Dr. Kondraki returned to the dormitory, with [[[SCP-285]]] in hand, and held the opposite end to the doctor's ear, with the mouthpiece directed in the general vicinity of the cafeteria. Dr. Dumont appears highly disquieted by the psychic noise, and despite his burns proceeds to curl up in bed and shudder. He was heard repeating 'loudnoise'. SCP-050 was discovered in Dr. Kondraki's administrative offices shortly afterward.
**Note:** //Dr. Dumont's burns have been healing nicely, but I doubt the psychological scarring will fade any time soon.// - Dr. ██████

**Entry 7:** It is April 1st, 2009. Dr. English made a seemingly innocuous comment to Dr. Kondraki about April fool's day being the perfect day for a prank. Though he wasn't worried about the thought, it did make him spend most of the day looking over his shoulder waiting to catch someone in a prank. Annoyed that nobody had the courage to prank him on April Fool's Day, Kondraki became distracted by his own agitation and walked into a pit containing [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-761 SCP-761]. Upon hitting the surface of the SCP, he fell through and ended up in an empty containment cell on the floor below. Dr. Kondraki spent 8 hours in the cell before a fellow researcher passed by and saw him banging on the observation window. SCP-050 appeared on Dr. English's desk the next morning.

**Entry 8:** Dr. Bright accesses SCP-705. 705 is allowed access to approximately one hundred pounds of similarly colored play dough. After several minutes 'conversation', the new army retreats to the ventilation shafts. No footage of Dr. Englishes room exists, but several hours later Dr. English stumbles out, covered in little red welts, and red play dough, swearing and muttering. SCP-050 transfers ownership to Dr. Bright.
