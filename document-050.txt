On 01/██/20██, Dr. Jack Bright was 'given the bird' on his way to the movies by a passing motorist. As is fairly normal for Dr. Bright, he tracked down the owner of the vehicle through the cars license plate, then proceeded to drive the gentleman to suicide via the use of [[[SCP-720]]]. 

While sanitizing the scene, Dr. Bright noticed an unusual monkey statue, but thought nothing of it. He continued on as normal, until, upon arrival at his office, he found the same statue waiting for him. His office had been tidied in his absence, and everything filed away, which came as something of a shock for the naturally messy Dr. Bright.

Upon further investigation, it was found that despite the apparent tidiness of his office, all of his pens had been drained of all but the last bit of ink, and several important documents had been translated into Aramaic. 

Dr. Bright immediately began the usual testing of this new SCP, but found himself going nowhere, until Dr. Rights, as payback for something unspecified, smeared his desk with one half of a compound epoxy, and applied the other half of the compound to his utensils. At this point, SCP-050 vanished from Dr. Brights office, reappearing in Dr. Rights office, where upon 050 began the clean up again.

After several tests, it became apparent that SCP-050 was easily contained, as long as no one outside the Foundation proved to be cleverer then the Foundation scientists. Of course, this led to many of the Foundation scientist seeking to claim the title of 'Most Clever' for themselves.

And thus began the "Great Researcher Prank War of '09."

**Entry 1:** On █ / █ / 2009, Dr. English re-opened [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/Scp-048 SCP-048] and listed Dr. Bright as the subject of study. The change slipped through the cracks and a few days later, Dr. Bright somehow managed to sleepwalk into SCP-040's containment room and upon seeing the desires in his dreams, SCP-040 changed him into a 52 kg statue of a turnip. The next morning, SCP-050 appeared on Dr. English's desk and the room had been cleaned as usual.
//Note:// Dr. English either neglected or simply forgot to revert SCP-048's files back to being close. The mistake was not discovered and corrected until several days, and several incarnations of Dr. Bright later. -05-█

**Entry 2:** On ██  / █ / 2009 Dr. English was admitted to the medical wards with severe abdominal pains. Subsequent testing showed that Dr. English was incubating the larvae of SCP-562. Subsequent reveiw of medical logs also showed that Dr. Dumount had somehow convinced Dr. English to strip naked and coat himself with green jello as part of the medical testing. Instead of curing the infestation of SCP-562 larvae, Dr. Dumount provided Dr. English with a large sugar pill, and a smaller sugar pill. Dr. English was told to take the large pill anally. Dr. English complied.  Shortly thereafter SCP-050 appeared in Dr. Dumont's office. It was later found that a sample of SCP-562's saliva had somehow gotten mixed into several drinks which were placed in Dr. English's cooler.
//Note: At present there is no cure for infection of SCP-562's larvae. Anything toxic enough to kill the larvae is toxic enough to kill the host. Fortunately after eruption no trace of SCP-562 remains in the system ~ Dr. Dumount//
