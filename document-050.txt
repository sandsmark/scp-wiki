//"The Great Researcher Prank War of '09"//
**Current Holder of 050:** Bright


On 01/██/20██, Dr. Jack Bright was 'given the bird' on his way to the movies by a passing motorist. As is fairly normal for Dr. Bright, he tracked down the owner of the vehicle through the cars license plate, then proceeded to drive the gentleman to suicide via the use of [[[SCP-720]]]. 

While sanitizing the scene, Dr. Bright noticed an unusual monkey statue, but thought nothing of it. He continued on as normal, until, upon arrival at his office, he found the same statue waiting for him. His office had been tidied in his absence, and everything filed away, which came as something of a shock for the naturally messy Dr. Bright.

Upon further investigation, it was found that despite the apparent tidiness of his office, all of his pens had been drained of all but the last bit of ink, and several important documents had been translated into Aramaic. 

Dr. Bright immediately began the usual testing of this new SCP, but found himself going nowhere, until Dr. Rights, as payback for something unspecified, smeared his desk with one half of a compound epoxy, and applied the other half of the compound to his utensils. At this point, SCP-050 vanished from Dr. Brights office, reappearing in Dr. Rights office, where upon 050 began the clean up again.

After several tests, it became apparent that SCP-050 was easily contained, as long as no one outside the Foundation proved to be cleverer then the Foundation scientists. Of course, this led to many of the Foundation scientist seeking to claim the title of 'Most Clever' for themselves.

And thus began the "Great Researcher Prank War of '09."

**Entry:** On █ / █ / 2009, Dr. English re-opened SCP-048 and listed Dr. Brights as the subject of study. The change slipped through the cracks and a few days later, Dr. Brights somehow managed to sleepwalk into SCP-040's containment room and upon seeing the desires in his dreams was changed into a 52 kg statue of a turnip. The next morning, SCP-050 appeared on Dr. English's desk and the room had been cleaned as usual.
