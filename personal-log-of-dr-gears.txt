Woke up early, due to the sound of explosion.  A new Agent entered the containment area of [[[SCP-236]]], and accidentally stepped on a unit.  The resulting explosion almost set of a chain reaction, but was contained successfully.  Unknown if Agent survived, but doubtful.  Was approached by Dr. █████ in the hall shortly after leaving my dormitory, in regards to a new subject being introduced to [[[SCP-212]]].  I am to supervise and document the proceedings, which will take place tomorrow.  The last subject exposed did not survive, and expired in such a way as to require lockdown of the test area.  It is hoped the current exposure will not repeat this outcome.

Spent most of the morning preparing documents for transfer to Central Records.  We are currently updating our database to an all-digital format.  Concerns have been raised due to the sheer volume of data.  Anyone could accidentally gain access to sensitive documents, copy them, and cause a security breech.  This possibility is remote, but with my own work taking several weeks to compile thus far, I feel it could be valid.

Lunch was eventful.  Several members of Zeta-9 had returned from a mission, and proceeded to state their superiority to several other teams present in R-4 lunchroom, most notably Phi-1, who they stated “keep their pansy little asses hidden in the base, while we do all the damn Deep work!”.  A sizable altercation broke out, which was separated by Agent Dorlin.  After his exposure [[[SCP-212]]], he has shown remarkable aptitude with his improvements, notably the “scythe-arms”.  The rest of the lunch period was uneventful, with the exception of [[[SCP-529]]] stealing a piece of ham from my plate.  Reported it to Site Security, who told me “don’t worry about it, she does that sometimes.”

Afternoon devoted to SCP review.  Meeting scheduled for tomorrow with [[[SCP-172]]].  Have received information that a new assistant will be assigned to me within the week, the old one having been removed from active service due to exposure to [[[SCP-008]]].  The assistance will be helpful, as the massive amount of compiling and updating is starting to affect my other duties.

Morning uneventful, despite brief lockdown due to a false alarm.  Met with new lab assistant after entering office.  "Iceberg" is a newly-appointed assistant, and seems somewhat eager to prove himself.  Assigned several stacks of reports to be compiled and sent to Central Records to him.  I dislike handing off work, but I can not do both jobs at once.  Received word that the subject set to be exposed to [[[SCP-212]]] has failed a drug screening, and will have to be postponed.

Met with [[[SCP-172]]].  “He” seemed very pleased today, and presented me with a blueprint for a non-lethal handgun.  Explained that it uses a sequence of chimes and air pulses, controlled by a central mainspring and “timing drum” to emit a series of tones and vibrations, causing instant loss of balance, partial blindness, and vomiting.  Requested [[[SCP-172]]] to create a prototype, to which he replied “Yes comrade, consider it already done.”  [[[SCP-172]]] appears to be working on a new module as well.  Inquired as to its function, to which [[[SCP-172]]] responded: “Your Agents seem lazy, comrade.  I will show them the proper way to drill and exercise.”  Will inquire with Site Supervision, about whether or not this should be allowed.  Remainder of meeting uneventful, [[[SCP-172]]] commenting several times that he “felt tired”.  Appeared to be “winding down” and returned to storage compartment after meeting conclusion.

Ate lunch in office.  Iceberg appears to have made a great deal of headway in the reports.  I think I’ll take him to assist with testing [[[SCP-882]]].  We lack documentation as to the exact time required for [[[SCP-882]]] to regain animation, and the time needed to manifest the “grinding” in subjects.  It appears Iceberg has yet to encounter high-security SCP.  This will be a valuable learning experience for him.  We will be flying to the containment site at the end of the week.

Minor security breech in the evening.  [[[SCP-076]]] exited containment area with extreme force, causing several injuries.  Members of security were talking outside of [[[SCP-076]]]s containment area.  [[[SCP-076]]] misheard a comment, and took offense.  Situation resolved, and a new blast door has been ordered.  Staff has been reminded not to remain in SCP containment areas when not actively working.

Long flight to the containment area.  On our approach, was informed that a security breech had occurred.  Agents moving [[[SCP-882]]] to the testing area had an accident, causing [[[SCP-882]]] to leave its secured transportation tank and strike a large metal blast door.  [[[SCP-882]]] immediately bonded with the door, and the entire area has been locked down.  Eight Agents and several members of staff were sealed in with [[[SCP-882]]].

Landed in the evening, with snow starting to fall.  Informed that a storm is coming, and we will be unable to leave for two weeks.  Containment area was mostly unsealed, with the exception of several areas near the site of the accident.  Lockdown is being maintained for the area until the fill extent of the [[[SCP-882]]] “infection” is contained.  All areas connecting to the accident site have been disconnected from the main containment facility via explosives.  It appears that several rooms and halls were “infected” before physical separation could be achieved.  [[[SCP-882]]] “spread” via wiring and other metallic devices.  Two Agents, Dr.  █████, and three D-Class personnel are still sealed in the affected areas.

Command has informed me that testing will continue as planned, with a new focus on the group dynamic when under extreme stress.  Security cameras appear to be unaffected by the infection, and observation has begun.  Assigned my assistant to the set-up of a central observation post with several CCTV and other monitoring devices.  He has been very quite.  Several of those sealed in with [[[SCP-882]]] appear very upset.  [[[SCP-882]]] is now only 26% covered in rust, and has started to make small, jerky movements.
