Woke up early, due to the sound of explosion.  A new Agent entered the containment area of [[[SCP-236]]], and accidentally stepped on a unit.  The resulting explosion almost set of a chain reaction, but was contained successfully.  Unknown if Agent survived, but doubtful.  Was approached by Dr. █████ in the hall shortly after leaving my dormitory, in regards to a new subject being introduced to [[[SCP-212]]].  I am to supervise and document the proceedings, which will take place tomorrow.  The last subject exposed did not survive, and expired in such a way as to require lockdown of the test area.  It is hoped the current exposure will not repeat this outcome.

Spent most of the morning preparing documents for transfer to Central Records.  We are currently updating our database to an all-digital format.  Concerns have been raised due to the sheer volume of data.  Anyone could accidentally gain access to sensitive documents, copy them, and cause a security breech.  This possibility is remote, but with my own work taking several weeks to compile thus far, I feel it could be valid.

Lunch was eventful.  Several members of Zeta-9 had returned from a mission, and proceeded to state their superiority to several other teams present in R-4 lunchroom, most notably Phi-1, who they stated “keep their pansy little asses hidden in the base, while we do all the damn Deep work!”.  A sizable altercation broke out, which was separated by Agent Dorlin.  After his exposure [[[SCP-212]]], he has shown remarkable aptitude with his improvements, notably the “scythe-arms”.  The rest of the lunch period was uneventful, with the exception of [[[SCP-529]]] stealing a piece of ham from my plate.  Reported it to Site Security, who told me “don’t worry about it, she does that sometimes.”

Afternoon devoted to SCP review.  Meeting scheduled for tomorrow with [[[SCP-172]]].  Have received information that a new assistant will be assigned to me within the week, the old one having been removed from active service due to exposure to [[[SCP-008]]].  The assistance will be helpful, as the massive amount of compiling and updating is starting to affect my other duties.
