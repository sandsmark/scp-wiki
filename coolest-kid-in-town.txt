title:Coolest Kid in Town
>  Open Mic Night at Stacker’s THURSDAYS 10:00
A stage! Check. Corny Collins cosplay? Check. Big band? Hmmm. Nope. Ah!

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/still-the-same-nightmares The last guy left a guitar.] Why not. Check. Magic Mic? Check. Backup vocals? Check. All clear. Action!

“I offer this song in another’s voice.”

Hey there, my cool, cool cats and ice cubes!
Stay right where you are!
'Cause it's time for Open Mic Night!
Brought to you by Stacker’s Coffeehouse and Bar!

Every Thursday night come on down and sing, yeah
//(Bop-bee-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba, bee-ba)//
Gimme all that you got when the 10 o' bells rings
//(Bop-bee-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba, bee-ba)//

Get your hat tossed in
Your nerves shaken away
And then you sing-a-strum-a-say-a
What you need-a to say
Could be a crash or a clown
Just be the coolest kid in town

Oooo! //(Ba, ba-ba-ba)// Oooo! //(Ba, ba-ba-ba)//

Oh every Thursday night, don’t matter when or where, yeah
//(Na, na, na, na, na, na-na-na-na)//
Stacker’s gon' be there with a ready player, yeah
//(Na, na, na, na, na, na-na-na-na)//

You play your heart right out
And let the music in
And when there’s no one left to play
We’ll play it all again
You better wear the crown
And be the coolest kid in town

Oooo! //(Ba, ba-ba-ba)// Oooo! //(Ba, ba-ba-ba)// Oooo! //(Ba, ba-ba-ba)// 

Coolest Kid in Town!
