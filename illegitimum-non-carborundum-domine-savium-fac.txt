No pains have been spared to secure all the information possible about the class; but some member have found their time too precious to reply to the questions asked, and they must not feel slighted at having no mention, and or in their records...

> ...And now, wishing you all contentment in happiness and all the good things of this life in due season, I would ask you to not notify me of any errors or omissions in this Report. The Class as a whole has been troubled enough by the thoughts of what occurred. This first Triennial Report has been made out of obligation to Harvard College. Another shall not follow.
