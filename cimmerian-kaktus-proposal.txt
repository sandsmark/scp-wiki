|comments= Almost everything about this that's any good comes from Kaktus. All hail the Kaktus. That's him as 05-1 and me as the Broke God in the audio.

[[include component:image-block name=brokegod.png|caption=SCP-001-J evading creditors in a 1990 Toyota Corolla by fleeing into space. The automobile has since been repossessed.]]

**Item #:** SCP-001-J

**Object Class:** Iyov

**Special Containment Procedures:**  SCP-001-J is under no circumstances to be allowed access to monetary gifts of any kind. Staff must relinquish all currency on their person before engaging in any interaction with SCP-001-J. 

The containment of SCP-001-J does not appear at this time to be attainable by the Foundation. However, due to SCP-001-J's apparent apprehension involving creditors, it may be possible to effect containment through such entities. More research is needed in this field.

**Description:** SCP-001-J is an omniscient, omnipotent, omnitemporal entity named Michael Kain, who is the primary deity worshiped by a group of religious zealots calling themselves "The Church of the Broke God". SCP-001-J wields great and terrible cosmic power, while possessing a distinct and crippling lack of adequate financial planning skills. 

SCP-001-J requires a significant influx of cash money in order to pay, in his own words, "the water bill, child support payments, bread, and some of those little hot dogs because protein is a must if you're just barely making ends meet." However, any amount of money given to SCP-001-J, by any individual and for any reason, will somehow mysteriously disappear, despite SCP-001-J's insistence that it was not spent on booze, cigarettes, and porno mags.

**Discovery:** SCP-001-J was discovered by O5-1 on a business trip to New York during an event later described by SCP-001-J as "that time you totally contained me", where O5-1 stopped SCP-001-J from stealing a bagel by shouting "hey, don't steal that bagel". Ever since O5-1 offered to pay for SCP-001-J's bagel, and gave him a few bucks for a cab, SCP-001-J has left no fewer than 17,000 voicemails on O5-1's phone, typically asking for money or, in some cases, talking at length about unrelated events before eventually asking for money. 

**Addendum 001-J.1:** Recorded Voicemails

The following voicemails were received by O5-1's office between April 20th, 2017, and May 1st, 2017. Notably, both the Global Occult Coalition and the Serpent's Hand also confirmed that SCP-001-J had called them asking for money during this time, while the Chaos Insurgency reported that SCP-001-J had called them, but only burped into the phone for fifteen seconds and hung up.

> Heyyyyyy Adam, it's me, Mike. Mike Kain? You know, from that one time we met when you contained me? Yeeeeeeeah I know that wasn't a super great look, but hey, look at me now, huh? Got a whole congregation together and everything. So that's great, say, while I'm here, I was going to ask you something. See, I'm really trying to put things back on track. Get life moving in a positive direction. I want to get some stuff, you know, to keep up appearances, but I'm a little short on scratch, you know? I know you've probably got your own stuff going on, but if you could spare like, a short term loan of like $200, that would be super. And you know I'm good for it, absolutely good for it. Anyway, just gimme a call back when you get a chance. Thanks again, buddy.

> Adam, my man, what's happening. Haven't heard back from you yet, but uh, definitely still trying to string together a few pennies, you know, pay off some... bills... get that sort of thing taken care of. Really, $200 might be a stretch, right? Because we really only met that one time, and I know this seems pretty forward and I get that. I do. So I'm thinking, really, if I could come up with like, $100, that would really get me settled. One foot in front of the other, you know? Tryin to make a change. I know you get me. Thanks again, my man.

> Have you been talking to that GOC son of a bitch? He doesn't know anything about me, Adam. Nothing. I don't even know his name. Look, I know I probably sounded drunk the other night, and you know what? Maybe I was. But this whole thing is a process, right? It's not gonna happen all at once, and I own that. I definitely own that. But look, I know I said that $100 would do it, but really I'm just trying to come up with like, whatever I can. I'm supposed to take my, uh... kids... yeah, my kids, supposed to take them to the... kid museum. And you can get in there for like twenty bucks, so if I could make that happen, me and you, that would be perfect. Twenty bucks, right? That's nothing. Anyway, hit me up bro.

> Alright, fine, you know what? I know that you've got me blocked or something, and I get that. I don't blame you. So I'm calling from my cousin Yabby's place, and he's a good dude, right? But look, I've got some guys I need to get paid, you know, who I borrowed some money from, and they're being pretty insistent about this whole thing, so at this point really anything would be perfect. Five bucks, even. Whatever you've got laying around under your desk, you know, anything I can give these guys. So give me a ring there homie, that would be great.

> Adam? Adam, I know you're there. Pick up the phone, Adam, come on. It's your ole pal Mike, right? Remember the good times we had that time? I am seriously in a pinch here my man, and if you've got like, cans or scrap metal laying around I could take off your hands, that would be fine. Plastic bottles, even. I've got a guy who will give me fifteen cents per pound of dryer lint, Adam, and I know you guys do a lot of laundry. Come on, man, you know I'm good for it. I'm totally good for it. But I'm serious about that dryer lint. Hello? Adam? Hellooooo?
