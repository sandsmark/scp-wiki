[[/div]]
----

**Special Containment Procedures:** The site of SCP-3651 is contained in a joint effort with the Greek government and Foundation by posing as a historical conservation society. The site is to be monitored at all times by Foundation personnel under the guise of conservationists and historical researchers. Non-Foundation individuals approaching the site are to be informed that the area is private property and off-limits to tourists as the temple undergoes restoration. Elevated containment procedures are to be observed during the third week of July on the Gregorian Calendar, during which SCP-3651 enters an active state.

SCP-3651 is to be guarded during the period of anomalous activity by three armed agents posing as members of the Hellenic Army and stationed around the perimeter of the temple. Access to the temple itself is to be limited to Foundation personnel assigned to SCP-3651. Any civilians that breach the perimeter are to be taken into custody and released at an appropriate location determined by the Site Security Director.

Due to the non-aggressive nature of the inhabitants of SCP-3651, research staff with Level 2 clearance or greater are permitted access for testing at any time.

**Description:** SCP-3651 is a space-time anomaly existing within the Temple of Aphrodite Urania located north-west of the Ancient Agora of Athens. The temple came under the Foundation's attention after reports of fifteen civilians (nine American tourists, three Japanese tourists, two German tourists, and one Greek national) who went missing from June 23rd, 2015 to July 21st, 2015. A Foundation investigation team determined that the anomaly is localized to the interior of the temple and manifests between the hours of 2200 to 2400 EEST starting the third week of June, leading up to the third week of July[[footnote]]It's been noted by Junior Researcher Hudson the time frame coincides with the Ancient Greek festival //Aphrodisia//, in honor of the goddess of love and beauty, Aphrodite.[[/footnote]]. 

SCP-3651-A is a parallel reality of modern Earth, seemingly identical to current reality, with timezones, locations, and individuals corresponding with their respective places. The only major, notable trait of SCP-3651-A as compared to baseline reality is that all human inhabitants are excessively sexually active both in public and in private, with social mores regarding sexual activity significantly relaxed compared to those of baseline reality. While this behavior has caused problems for SCP-3651-A society — such as increased STD rates — they have accordingly advanced science and medicine technology to a degree capable of countering these threats. For details, see //addenda//.

Video feed gathered via remote surveillance drone shows inhabitants of SCP-3651 (hereafter referred to as SCP-3651-1) reacting to drone activity with responses ranging from mild curiosity to sexual acts. On 06/21/2017, after deeming SCP-3651 non-hazardous for Foundation personnel, Senior Researcher  Livermore authorized three cadets of Mobile Task Force Lambda-5 ("White Rabbits") accompanied by a Staff sergeant access into SCP-3651 for reconnaissance purposes.

**Addendum 3651.1:** Discovery

Exploration of SCP-3651 began on 06/23/2016 at roughly 1300 MST (2200 EEST) via miniature aerial drone deployed by Site personnel stationed in Athens, Greece. Upon initial entry into SCP-3651-A, the operating crew did not discover any deviations from baseline reality, and believed the drone to have simply passed through the temple's inner walls.

This was quickly corrected during a routine flyover en route to Athens, Greece on Motorway A1, 18 miles from city limits. At approximately 2312 EEST, footage from the aerial drone spotted a large crowd congregated at what seemingly appeared to be a traffic jam. The drone descended upon a large gathering of pedestrians[[footnote]]Cursory estimates place the numbers of participants between 300 to 400.[[/footnote]] in various stages of undress engaging in a variety of sexual activities[[footnote]]Including a range from foreplay, masturbation, oral sex to full intercourse.[[/footnote]].

SCP-3651-1 instances were observed to be engaging in numerous sexual acts in groups of varying sizes, with the largest recorded group consisting of over 20 participants. Though singular instances were seen to engage in masturbatory behavior, many would quickly attempt to join other groups and exchange partners.

The aerial drone remained active for the next 12 hours before returning to Site command for recharge. All video footage and images were documented and logged on 06/23/2016.

**DATE:** 06/23/16 - 06/24/16

**NOTE:** The following video footage details significant events which occurred between the hours of 2200 EEST - 1200 EEST.
----

[BEGIN LOG]

**2200:** Initial contact with SCP-3651-A. No anomalous activity reported.

**2312:** First event encountered on Motorway A1 near Athens, Greece. See //Addendum 3651.1//.

**2438:** Drone observed a minor roadway collision resulting in minor fender damage but no injuries. The drivers involved exited their vehicles and confronted one another. The dispute was apparently resolved when one driver removed her underwear and straddled the other driver's face.

**0100-0600**: During this time, drone was set on standby and reactivated at exactly 0600. No further observations was made during this time.

**0617**: The drone observed a funeral service at a cemetery on the outskirts of Athens. A priest, naked from the waist down, addressed a crowd of mourners, delivering the funeral rites while vigorously masturbating.

**0730**: As the citizens of Athens prepared for work, their fashion tastes were observed to be different from the standard fare in baseline reality. Various states of undress seemed to be socially acceptable, as were more provocative modes of dressing in professional setting. A statistically significant increase of people with hermaphroditic features were also observed among the citizens.

**0932**: First contact with an SCP-3651-1 instance was established at 09:32 when the drone encountered an adult female, estimated age 25-30. Upon becoming aware of the drone, the subject initiated masturbatory behavior without breaking eye contact with the drone's camera. Note: //based on subsequent investigation, the research team concludes that the subject's goal was not self-gratification through physical stimulation, but rather through permitting self-stimulation to be observed by what she believed to be the audience of a widely syndicated 'reality television' program.//

**1012**: The drone recorded footage of the Old Royal Palace situated north of Syntagma Square. A female adolescent (designated Subject A), estimated age 14-16, wearing a white tunic, is found walking up the Palace's staircase to an ornate altar[[footnote]]Foundation mythologists state the altar is consistent with iconography and text representing the Ancient Greek goddess, Aphrodite.[[/footnote]]. 

She is accompanied by three additional females (designated Subject B, C, and D) , all of similar age and apparel, carrying among them a small white dove, a bouquet of Anemônê (//Anemone coronaria//) flowers, and a ceremonial blade.

**1015**: Subjects A through D reach the top of the Old Royal Palace's staircase and begin placing objects on the altar.

**1016**: Subject C laid the bouquet of Anemone at the altar's center, accompanied by Subject B setting the dove above it. A poem is recited by all subjects and was recorded by communications personnel. The full transcription of the poem is as follows:

//"Iridescent-throned Aphrodite, deathless
Child of Zeus, wile-weaver, we now implore you,
Come -- we beg you, Lady -- with cheer and comfort,
Lift up our spirits,//

//Skimming down the paths of the sky's bright ether
On they brought you over the earth's black bosom,
Swiftly--then you stood with a sudden brilliance,
Goddess, before us;//

//Come to us once more, and bless us with thy presence;
Take all bitter care from our minds, and give us
All we long for; Lady, in all our battles
Is thy presence forevermore."//

**1018**: Subject A was handed the ceremonial blade by Subject D and inflicted a lethal stab wound through the dove's midsection.

**1019**: A Mediterranean female (designated SCP-3651-2), estimated age 35-40, is seen exiting the Old Royal Palace and approaches all Subjects present. Subjects A through D bow toward SCP-3651-2 as a gesture of supplication.

**1020**: SCP-3651-2 retrieves what appears to be a golden apple and after 10 seconds, hands the object toward Subject B. The object emits a mass of light. It is approximately 40cm in diameter and emits 120 candelas of luminosity. 

**1021**: Disruptions occur within the drone's internal camera and it begins to malfunction. Drone recalled toward SCP-3651-A's point of origin for recharge and examination.

**Note**: SCP-3651-2 bears numerous physical anomalies: While the subject always displays light blue/green heterochromia, its physical appearance varies depending on the observer's romantic or sexual interests. It will always appear as female regardless of the observer's sexual orientation.

For example, when Researcher Albrite observed SCP-3651-2, the subject was directly perceived as his fiancee despite residing in Yuma, Arizona as of 06/23/2016. 

Meanwhile, another Site researcher described the subject resembling American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift.

Afterwards, the Site personnel contacted Site Command; an attempt to communicate with the presiding government of SCP-3651-A was made.

**Addendum 3651.2**: Initial Contact

Communications with SCP-3651-A civilization were initiated on 06/30/2016. Details of political organization and cultural development of SCP-3651-A were disclosed. SCP-3651-A civilization is governed under an authoritarian leadership consisting of SCP-3651-2 instances claiming to be fertility deities originating from ancient mythology, with each presiding over their respective nation(s). Despite these figures exercising absolute political power over the state, scientific advancements, cultural trends, and artistic expression, SCP-3651-A still effectively parallels baseline reality, with the exceptions of greater advancements in biological science (viz. cosmetics, birth control methodologies, and STD/STI treatments) and relaxed sexual mores.

On the approximate start date of extensive communication with SCP-3651-A civilization, three (3) Cadets and one (1) Staff Sergeant of Mobile Task Force Lambda-5 ("White Rabbits") were authorized by both parties for examination and exploration of SCP-3651-A from 06/21/2017 - 07/21/2017.

All logs and interviews are available in //Addendum 3651.3// and //Addendum 3651.4//.

> 
> //Instructor spends the next 30 minutes going over the course curriculum, syllabus, and RRCC rules and regulations. After completing class orientation, the instructor walks to the back of room, powers off the classroom lights, and turns on an overhead projector. The projector displays WWII-era German troops marching through Warsaw, Poland after invading the nation on September 1st, 1939.//
> 
> **Instructor**: "Okay, I know you're all excited to go home but we have a few minutes left and I want to go through a brief introduction of this course before I send everyone off."
> 
> //Instructor clicks on a remote control, displaying a slide of American troops storming the beaches of Normandy, France, on June 6, 1944.//
> 
> **Instructor:** "So to begin, World War II is so enormous in its scope and savagery, it's almost impossible to imagine, let alone encompass in a short lecture. Humankind's powers of reason and capacity for irrationality remained unchanged on the eve of World War II. What changed was the technology of destruction: ships and tanks and planes of prodigious power, a cascade of destructive force culminating in the atomic bomb."
> 
> //The slide switches to a mushroom cloud which fills the screen.//
> 
> **Instructor:** "On August 6th. 1945, the United States dropped a nuclear bomb over the city of Hiroshima. The destruction was massive. Over 100,000 civilian deaths in a single day. But that's not the end. Not yet. I want to show you a video clip taken on August 7th, 1945 a day just after the bombing."
> 
> //The slide switches to a WWII-era news broadcast clip hosted on the popular video-sharing website YouTube. Upon pressing play, the clip initially shows the ruins of Hiroshima. A Japanese war correspondent is on screen, walking through rubble. Approx. 0:39 seconds later, an unidentified figure is seen hovering over Hiroshima. The camera man points at it.//

> 
> //A nationwide broadcast by former White House Press Secretary Charlie Ross is filmed by CBS News. The date at the bottom reads "August 10th, 1945".//
> 
> **Ross**: "A state of emergency has been declared in the United States of America, including all overseas dependencies, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. We face- We, uh- For reasons yet to be determined, hostilities between both Allied and Axis forces have abruptly ceased without Allied Command issuing any formal ceasefire.
> 
> Furthermore, on August 7th, the US War Department received reports of widespread acts of indecency, both heterosexual and homosexual in nature, between Axis and Allied troops deployed in the European and Pacific Theater. Reports from Berlin indicate that occupying Soviet troops have also succumbed to this strange affliction.
> 
> US War Secretary Henry Stimson has authorized an indefinite deferral of the return of all troops and material from the European and Pacific Theaters in an attempt to prevent the epidemic from reaching American shores. We don't know what it is, or how it is transmitted. The War Department has dismissed the possibility, raised by some commentators, that we may be witnessing the effects of an Axis 'Wonder Weapon' deployed in a final act of revenge. 
> 
> Those affected have no symptoms of any disease. However, we do know that its influence has been spreading.
> 
> On August 8th, further reports were documented in Algeria that conflicts between the National Liberation Front and the French colonial government have spontaneously ceased, and that the epidemic of public indecency has spread to the southern coast of the Mediterranean. As in Europe and in the Pacific, these acts are occurring between antagonistic forces and display both heterosexual and homosexual natures. Later that day, civil disruption resulting from public indecency was reported as far as South Africa, and within Russia, China, and Japanese-occupied Indochina.
> 
> On August 9th, we received reports that similar incidents have occurred in Australia, South America, and Mexico. The epidemic is on our borders. President Truman has outlined a plan to deal with situations that may arise within the United States..."
> 
> //The camera cuts to U.S. Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson.//
> 
> **Stimson**: "As of 8 a.m., Eastern Standard Time, the president has declared the continental United States under martial law. A nationwide curfew of 7 p.m., tonight, has been put into effect, and any citizen caught outdoors between 7 p.m. and 7 a.m. is subject to arrest, and detention without counsel. In order to halt the spread of this anomaly, our nation's borders with Canada and Mexico have been sealed. No questions."
> 
> //Video ends. Instructor turns off projector and flips on classroom lights.//
> 
> **Instructor:** "And that, as they say, was that. There was no more talk of an epidemic soon after. A few enclaves in some parts of the world such as the Middle East and the American South resisted the phenomenon for a time on religious grounds, but today virtually everyone accepts the advantages of erotic living over mankind's destructive tendencies.
> 
> And the world was better off for it; and not just because it brought an end to conflict and violence. All of the wealth we had been wasting on bombers and battleships, the brainpower squandered building more powerful bombs, was redirected to more constructive uses, and it paid dividends.
> 
> Advances in the biological and medical sciences were catapulted light-years ahead in the subsequent decades. The resistance-proof antibiotics and antivirals which helped us eradicate syphilis and herpes would later help us eradicate smallpox and treat life-threatening bacterial infections. 
> 
> The gene therapies and metabolic enhancers we use to become more virile and desirable have saved thousands from living with congenital disorders and birth defects. Even our reversible contraceptive drugs have helped us to live productive lives and bring children into the world precisely when we're ready to give them the most nurturing environment in which to grow up.

According to Foundation intelligence, they are a rebel insurgency active in the United Kingdom, the United States, and various parts of Western Europe. They claim to be dedicated to reviving democratic republicanism, the belief that all nations should be returned to independent republics accompanied by the restoration of social mores prior to WWII.

Y'may not know it, but back then, before what we lads call //The Takeover//, there was this thing called marriage."
> 
> **SCP-3651-1**: "Anyway, I met this one girl named Martha. Sweet lass. Came from the countryside. Met her one day at the shop. It was love at first sight. Got butterflies in me belly just lookin' at her. We talked for hours and after, oh, datin' for a year or so. Decided to get married back at her farm back home. It was funny, a city boy marrin' a country girl. Ain't that common, even before the war."
>

Eventually, the shades caught up to us; forced me wife and I to get a divorce, and shipped her off to God knows where. A few buddies o' mine tried trackin' her down. The UK, Germany, France, even the Eastern bloc. Nothin'. It's like she vanished off the face of God's green Earth."
