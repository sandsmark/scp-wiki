**Item#:** SCP-741

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedure:**
Due to object's location on the floor of the ██████ sea (coordinates: [REDACTED]) regular maintenance should be performed with a remotely-operated submersible. The submersible is to repair any cracks found in the structure surrounding the nuclear reactor of SCP-741. Sea traffic is permitted on the waters directly above SCP-741, but if any non-SCP vessel stops near or attempts to investigate SCP-741 (to include any active sonar ops within 3-4km), a disguised SCP combat ship is to escort the intruder away from the location. If warnings are not heeded the intruder shall be destroyed. Destruction of the intruding vessel must be conducted in a way that will not compromise SCP-741's hull. Passive acoustic sensors shall be deployed in the vicinity of SCP-741. To avoid detection by potentially hostile parties, no active sonar or visible lighting shall be used except by patrolling ships.

**Description:**
SCP-741 is a sunken Russian Papa-class submarine. SCP-741's hull is emblazoned with the name "███████████", which means [DATA EXPUNGED]. Western intelligence agencies were not aware of the existence of a second Papa-class boat; evidently the present-day Russian government was likewise unaware of it. Attempts to contact persons who were part of the Soviet military upper echelon during the times when this submarine is presumed to have been built have failed - [DATA EXPUNGED].

The object lies on the ocean floor, mostly intact save for a large hole just forward of the sail and another on the starboard side, just aft of the missile tubes. Debris recovered from this hole indicates that the sub was struck by a P-120 Malakhit anti-ship missile while surfaced. One of the boat's P-120 missiles has been fired. It is unclear if this indicates that SCP-741 sunk itself, or if it was sunk in combat with another ship. Evidence suggests the former: it would be rather illogical for a submarine to fight while surfaced. The sub appears to have sunk due to rapid flooding following the missile strike. No remains of the crew have been found, either within the vessel or in the vicinity, and all emergency escape equipment is untouched. Divers sent to investigate reported anomalous currents, abnormal sea life, temporal distortion (specifically [REDACTED]), hearing moans, unexplained voices and unintelligible whispering, and the presence of blurry, faintly glowing figures. Sea life in the area has been observed to be unusually aggressive - two divers were killed and eaten by a large female //Somniosus microcephalus//, normally considered to be a docile species. Another diver was seriously injured by a male //Hexanchus griseus//, another species not normally known for aggression.

It should be noted that the Euclid-class label is not because of SCP-741's nuclear reactor itself but because of what the nuclear reactor contains. The reactor outwardly appears to be a type-████ submarine pressurized water reactor, but after a thorough scan it was discovered that there is an artifact inside it that produces large amounts of radiation.

The artifact is an Indonesian keris dagger (Designated SCP-741-1). Its blade is serpentine with seven curves, and is composed of an unknown alloy. The dagger points in the direction of the closest organism outside its reactor chamber. The mechanism by which it locates organisms is unknown. According to our intelligence sources the keris was obtained by a Russian spy during the September 30 incident (for details refer to document █████/██). Due to the hectic political situation of the time all records about the previous owners of the keris are lost. It is theorized that the keris is somehow the cause of the magnetic and temporal disruptions in the surrounding area.

The keris emits intense radiation, primarily gamma rays. When exposed to magnetic fields, however, the radiation changes, becoming mostly beta particles and some neutrons. In either case, the radiation is dangerously intense, as much as 16.4 Gy/hour at a distance of 10m, sufficient to render standard radiation protection suits useless. For unknown reasons, the submarine's hull blocks nearly all of the radiation. Analysis of the hull material shows it to be a titanium-zirconium alloy which, while unusual and structurally strong, should not be a particularly good radiation shield.

**Incident Report I741-1-A**: On █████████, SCPS //Tunguska// reported a submerged contact approaching SCP-741 from the south at 46 knots. Acoustic signature of the contact did not match any known submarine or torpedo. Contact did not respond to sonobuoy drops or active sonar pings. When the contact crossed into the 8km total underwater exclusion zone (TUEZ), contact was classified hostile. //Tunguska// engaged the hostile with a volley from the RBU-12000, but missed. Hostile did not change course, but sonar recorded sounds of an undersea missile launch. //Tunguska// broke away and fired five UGST-1 torpedoes toward the attacker. Missiles of unknown configuration were observed breaking the water 15 seconds later, flying at an altitude of 1.8 meters at a velocity of 0.92 Mach. No radar emissions were detected from the missiles and they did not respond to launched chaff or flares. Both missiles were engaged by //Tunguska//'s SA-N-9 Gauntlet SAMs and Kashtan point defense systems, and were destroyed at 700 meters and 210 meters from impact. Afterward, hostile could be heard engaging in evasive maneuvers, followed by four closely-spaced explosions and the sound of a submarine disintegrating. The identity and intentions of the attacker have not yet been determined.

In light of this incident, the acoustic sensor net should be expanded and additional patrol and defense assets acquired.

**Addendum 741b**: Further analysis of the sonar recordings taken by SCPS //Tunguska// during Incident I741-1-A have revealed anomalous acoustic signatures not consistent with any known form of propulsion, including magnetohydrodynamic drive. Anomalous transients reminiscent of [REDACTED] are also audible during the breakup of the unknown attacker.

**Addendum 741c**: Divers have recovered wreckage from the unknown submarine and the missiles. Analysis of the submarine hull components reveals some kind of resilient carbon composite layered over scandium-aluminum alloy tiles - not a design in use by any known nation. The missile parts consist mostly of magnesium and aluminum, however the few surviving avionic components seem to be optronic, not electronic in nature.

Studies of the recovered wreckage are ongoing.
