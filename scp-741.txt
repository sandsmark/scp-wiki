**Item#:** SCP-741

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedure:** As the object is sunken at extreme depth and surrounded by a region of elevated pressure, it largely isolates itself from external influence. Nevertheless, periodic monitoring by sonar and/or submersible should be conducted to ensure it has not been tampered with. Russia has actively encouraged the use of the Foundation-contracted Russian warship SCPS //Tunguska// for these purposes.

**Description:**
SCP-741 is a sunken Soviet submarine. It sunk near ███, ███ in March, 1968, however the Foundation did not take over custody of the vessel until ████████ ██, 1999. The submarine itself is a modified version of the Hotel class, altered to carry 6 P-120 Malakhit anti-shipping cruise missiles in place of her usual ballistic missiles. 

Prior to sinking, the sub had been deployed under unusual circumstances which garnered the attention of Western intelligence agencies. The United States government attempted to recover the vessel in the early 1970s as Project Jennifer. This was moderately successful, though precisely what it recovered was never disclosed. In the late 1990s, agents within the US government, affiliated with [REDACTED], contacted the Foundation with news of a potential Euclid or Keter-class object within the wreck. Following negotiations, the Foundation took custody of the wreck and has had it under surveillance ever since.

The vessel lies on the ocean floor, in three pieces. Evidence suggests the hull was broken apart during the Project Jennifer recovery attempt, and that it sunk largely intact save for a hole just forward of the sail and another further aft, just below the starboard missile tubes. Debris recovered from this hole indicates that the sub was struck by a P-120 Malakhit anti-ship missile while surfaced. One of the boat's P-120 missiles has been fired. It is unclear if this indicates that SCP-741 sunk itself, or if it was sunk in combat with another ship. Since the modified Hotel variant would have had to surface to fire missiles, little can be inferred. The sub appears to have sunk due to rapid flooding following the missile strike. No remains of the crew have been found, either within the vessel or in the vicinity, and all emergency escape equipment is untouched. Divers sent to investigate reported anomalous currents, abnormal sea life, hearing moans, unexplained voices and unintelligible whispering, and the presence of blurry, faintly glowing figures. Sea life in the area has been observed to be unusually aggressive - A diver was seriously injured by a large squid of unknown species, and on two occasions, observation submersibles have been aggressively approached by sharks and large squid.

The wreck is surrounded by an anomalous pressure gradient extending approximately 250m centered on a point 30m aft of the center of the sub. Within the affected region, pressure is much greater than is expected for the depth. This is believed to be the reason why Project Jennifer could not recover the entire submarine. It has also significantly hampered further salvage and investigation efforts.

What records the Foundation has been able to obtain from Russia and the United States about the sub strongly suggest that it was being used to carry some unknown secret cargo. Codewords used in the Russian documents imply that the secret cargo did not have anything to do with the typical nuclear or chemical weapons of the day. A mention is made to Project Koshchei [DATA EXPUNGED]

**Incident Report I741-C**: On █████████, SCPS //Tunguska// reported a submerged contact approaching SCP-741 from the south at 46 knots. Acoustic signature of the contact did not match any known submarine or torpedo. Contact did not respond to sonobuoy drops or active sonar pings. When the contact crossed into the 18km total underwater exclusion zone (TUEZ), contact was classified hostile. Sonar recorded sounds of an undersea missile launch. //Tunguska// broke away and fired five UGST-1 torpedoes toward the attacker. Missiles of unknown configuration were observed breaking the water 15 seconds later, flying at an altitude of 1.8 meters at a velocity of 0.92 Mach. No radar emissions were detected from the missiles and they did not respond to launched chaff or flares. Both missiles were engaged by //Tunguska//'s 9K311 Tor SAMs and Kashtan point defense systems, and were destroyed at 1800 meters and 210 meters from impact. Afterward, hostile could be heard engaging in evasive maneuvers, followed by four closely-spaced explosions and the sound of a submarine disintegrating. The identity and intentions of the attacker have not yet been determined.

In light of this incident, the acoustic sensor net should be expanded and additional patrol and defense assets acquired.

**Addendum 741b**: Further analysis of the sonar recordings taken by SCPS //Tunguska// during Incident I741-C have revealed anomalous acoustic signatures not consistent with any known form of propulsion, including magnetohydrodynamic drive. Anomalous transients reminiscent of [REDACTED] are also audible during the breakup of the unknown attacker.
