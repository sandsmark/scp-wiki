title:Scp 741
**Item#:** SCP-741

**Class:** Euclid/Keter

**Special Containment Procedure:**
Due to object's location, which is on the seafloor of the ██████ sea (exact coordinates are [DATA EXPUNGED]), regular maintenance should be done with a remotely-operated submersible. The submersible is to repair any cracks found in the structure surrounding the nuclear reactor of SCP-741. Sea traffic is to be permitted on the waters directly above SCP-741, but if any non-SCP vessel stops near SCP-741, a disguised SCP combat ship is to escort the intruder away from the location. If warnings are not heeded, the intruder may be destroyed. Keep in mind that the destruction of the intruding vessel must not be done directly above SCP-741. Underwater cameras and sensors are to be installed around SCP-741, but absolutely no kind of lighting device must be present to avoid detection by other parties.

**Description:**
SCP-741 is a Russian submarine of ███████████ manufacture. SCP-741's hull is emblazoned with the name "███████████", which means [DATA EXPUNGED]. It was assumed that this is a failed prototype, and intelligence reports show that the Russian government had erased their own collective minds concerning the object. The object lies broken on the ocean floor, and the constant maintenance is for the nuclear reactor inside. Although dormant, it may leak out radiation if left unrepaired.

SCP-741 was apparently destroyed in a swift incident, but no remains of the crew members are found. Divers who were sent to investigate reported 'disturbance in the waves', some 'temporal distruptions', hearing moans and uinintelligible whispering, and the presence of blurry, faintly glowing figures. It was determined that SCP-741 was a failed copycat experiment of the Philadelphia Experiment (refer to article ██████ / ██ regarding this), which was done by the Russians. This explains the subsequent cover-up and collective forgetfulness of the Russians.

It is to be noted that the Keter-class label is not because of SCP-741's powers, but because of the nuclear reactor it contains.
