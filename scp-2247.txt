**Item #:** SCP-2247

**Object Class:** Euclid 

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2247 is to be held at a modified humanoid containment cell at Site-17, with soundproof walls. While outside its cell, SCP-2247 is to be muzzled. Personnel handling SCP-2247 are to don sound-cancelling headphones, and (preferably) have limited to no comprehension of the Spanish language. 

Interviews with SCP-2247 are to be conducted via Spanish speaking D-class personnel as intermediaries. Audio recordings of interviews involving SCP-2247 may only be accessed by personnel with Level 1-4/2247 security clearance. Pursuant to the Astrakhan Protocol, O5 Council members are denied access to audio recordings of SCP-2247's vocalisations. Instead, they are allowed access to transcripts of those vocalisations. 

**Description:** SCP-2247 is a male adult human with light skin. Height and mass are 1.83 m and 75 kg respectively. SCP-2247 is capable of speech in Spanish, but it is unable to comprehend written Spanish. MRI scans indicate no damage to its Broca's area. A barcode-shaped birthmark is imprinted on SCP-2247's left thigh, corresponding to a serial number for products manufactured by Abbott Laboratories.

SCP-2247's physiology is comparable with a non-anomalous human. When SCP-2247's extracted biological matter is displaced from it for at least three minutes continuously, they will undergo transmutation into the following substances with masses equal to the matter originally extracted. 

||~ Biological Matter ||~ Transmuted Substance ||
|| Hair and skin extracted from the head || Polypropylene ||
|| Hair, nail and skin extracted from the body, neck or limbs || Polyethylene ||
|| Body fluids and sub-dermal tissues (e.g. muscle) || Solution consisting of a mixture of sodium thiopental and sodium carbonate ||

Notably, the volume of the transmuted solution is consistently lesser if the sample of body fluids is extracted from SCP-2247's head than from the rest of its body. Reverse-transmutation does not occur when transmuted substances are reintroduced to SCP-2247.  

SCP-2247's verbal communication is restricted to interrogative sentences. To the Foundation's knowledge, it has not yet been observed to vocalise non-interrogative sentences. Individuals who have perceived and comprehended SCP-2247's vocalisations (hereon referred to as 'subjects') become susceptible to SCP-2247's interrogative statements, responding according to respective subjects' factual knowledge and/or sincere opinion on the given topic. 

SCP-2247 was recovered outside the Biblioteca Nacional in Buenos Aires on ██/██/1985, where it was sighted enquiring civilians for directions to any nearby Foundation facilities. Responding to the supposed security breach, Mobile Task Force Alpha-7 ("Security Blanket") was dispatched to capture SCP-2247. 

SCP-2247 surrendered to MTF A-7 without incident after it used its anomalous properties to discern their affiliation with the Foundation. It was subsequently classified as SCP-2247 when medical examinations detected its anomalous features. SCP-2247 was dismissed as an escaped mental ward patient on local media channels. 

**Addendum 2247-1:** Records recovered from Argentine authorities indicate that a person with identical physical and anomalous features with those of SCP-2247 was incarcerated from 1978 to 1982. It was charged of intrusion into a chemical storage room at the Higher School of Mechanics of the Navy (ESMA) [[footnote]] A detention centre operational during the National Reorganisation Process regime. [[/footnote]] in Buenos Aires. The means in which it entered ESMA were unknown. 

Inventory checks conducted after SCP-2247 arrest identified one 500 mg vial of sodium thiopental-sodium carbonate solution as missing; whereabouts remain unknown.  

During its incarceration, SCP-2247 is known to have assisted in the extraction of confessions from prisoners held at ESMA. SCP-2247 vanished on ██/██/1982 while in its cell, escorted by two unidentified intruders.

> **Interviewee:** SCP-2247
> 
> **Interviewer:** Agent Pedro de Souza 
> 
> **Foreword:** Interview aims to identify SCP-2247 and its intents, and is originally conducted in Spanish. As its anomalous properties were not yet understood, a non-D-class personnel served as interviewer. 
> 
> **<Begin Log>**
> 
> **Agent de Souza:** For our records, start by giving us your name? 
> 
> **SCP-2247:** May you give me your name and position, instead? 
> 
> **Agent de Souza:** Pedro de Souza. Agent of Mobile Task Force Alpha-7. [pauses] Wait, you should be telling me your name.
> 
> **SCP-2247:** What makes you think I could do that? 
> 
> **Agent de Souza:** There's no reason you can't. Just tell me your name. 
> 
> **SCP-2247:** What is the name of your group's database? 
> 
> **Agent de Souza:** RAISA. [pauses] Ah, so this is your anomalous effect... 
> 
> **SCP-2247:** What is your password for RAISA?
> 
> **Agent de Souza:** █████████. [pauses] I'm compromised. Abo-
> 
> **SCP-2247:** Do you like this demonstration? Do I pass the audition? 
> 
> **Agent de Souza:** [pauses] No, I do not. You proved yourself to be more dangerous than we initially believe you to be. And I cannot say if you pass any audition, since there is no such thing to my knowledge. 
> 
> [SCP-2247 looks around the interrogation chamber.]
> 
> **SCP-2247:** Where are the cameras with your bosses looking at us? 
> 
> **Agent de Souza:** Left corner behind you. 
> 
> [SCP-2247 turns to its left, elevating its head to look at the upper edges of the chamber.]
> 
> **SCP-2247:** Do you like this audition? Do I get the job?
> 
> **Agent de Souza:** There is no audition for Natasha to like. And there is no job up for grabs for you.
> 
> **SCP-2247:** Why are you so grumpy about? 
> 
> **Agent de Souza:** I'm supposed to be interrogating you instead, but you decided to make a mockery out of this process.   
> 
> **SCP-2247:** Why can't you see my worth as a potential employee, like the Process had? 
> 
> **Agent de Souza:** I don't know about the Process, but we do not employ SCPs. 
> 
> **SCP-2247:** What else would I be doing, if I can't help you? 
> 
> **Agent de Souza:** You will be helping us by staying here and letting us do research on you without hindering us! 
> 
> **SCP-2247:** [frowns] Do you think that this is better than being spirited away from that job you could finally do by some self-righteous boludos? And speaking of those boludos, can serpents even have hands? 
> 
> **Agent de Souza:** Work policy-wise, I am obligated to say yes. You are better off with us. And biologically speaking, serpents do not have hands. 
> 
> **SCP-2247:** [smiles] But can I still do my job? Why should I be denied from my purpose? 
> 
> **Agent de Souza:** I still do not know what is your job or purpose, so I can't tell if you are deprived of them.
> 
> **SCP-2247:** Can't you see?
> 
> **Agent de Souza:** 20/20. [pauses] Oh, fuck you. 
> 
> [SCP-2247 places its right palm over its forehead, bowing his head at Agent de Souza.]
> 
> **Agent de Souza:** Wait, so you were in a library. Did those boludos bring you there? Just nod your head if they did, and shake if they did not. 
> 
> [SCP-2247 nods its head.]
> 
> **Agent de Souza:** Good. The boludos called that library the Wanderer's Library, right? 
> 
> [SCP-2247 nods its head.]
> 
> **Agent de Souza:** So you were in that library for some time. Was your time there enjoyable? 
> 
> [SCP-2247 shakes its head.]
> 
> **Agent de Souza:** Okay, you can tell why was it not enjoyable, but I need you to be as detailed as possible. The more detailed your question, the more you are helping us. You're here to be helpful to us, yes?
> 
> [SCP-2247 nods its head.]
> 
> **Agent de Souza:** Go on. Why wasn't it?
> 
> **SCP-2247:** What is the point of libraries and books when I can't read a single thing?
> 
> **Agent de Souza:** There's no point being there if you can't read. [pauses] Not bad for a first, but strive for details when speaking from now on. Remember that it is helping us too. 
> 
> [SCP-2247 nods its head.]
> 
> **Agent de Souza:** So you decided that library was not worth it. Why come for us? 
> 
> **SCP-2247:** Why are the Jailors so popular among the topics spoken by the boludos? 
> 
> **Agent de Souza:** I daresay we are quite prominent to the anomalous community, likely for our actions. [pauses] So you wanted to return to do your thing again? Nod if yes. Shake if no.
> 
> [SCP-2247 nods its head.]
> 
> **Agent de Souza:** And you see the Foundation as a suitable continuation of your work with the Process. 
> 
> **SCP-2247:** How are the Process and Jailors any different really?  
> 
> **Agent de Souza:** Many. They are a junta restricted to one country, while we are more global in range.
> 
> **SCP-2247:** But do the Jailors also lock up people secretly? 
> 
> **Agent de Souza:** Yes we do. [pauses] Okay, I think we are done for today. Please do not speak another word. You have done well for today. 
> 
> **<End Log>** 
> 
> **Closing Statement:** Due to SCP-2247's anomalous effect, it is suggested that only D-class personnel are allowed interaction with it to minimise breach of sensitive information. It is also advisable for interviewers to use polar questions when enquiring information from SCP-2247. Due to breach of sensitive information, Agent Pedro de Souza's RAISA password has been reset.

> 
> [SCP-2247 nods its head.]
> 
> **D-2214:** Okay... The doctors did some tests on you the other week, and found that pieces of you transform into things like plastic and thiopental. Do you have anything to say about it? Remember the descriptives!
> 
> **SCP-2247:** [frowns] When did the woman's enchantment fail?
