**Item #:** SCP-2247

**Object Class:** Euclid 

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2247 is to be held at a modified humanoid containment cell at Site-17, with soundproof walls. While outside its cell, SCP-2247 is to be muzzled. Personnel handling SCP-2247 are to don sound-cancelling headphones, and (preferably) have limited to no comprehension of the Spanish language. 

Interviews with SCP-2247 are to be conducted via Spanish speaking D-class personnel as intermediaries. Audio recordings of interviews involving SCP-2247 may only be accessed by personnel with Level 1-4/2247 security clearance. Pursuant to the Astrakhan Protocol, O5 Council members are denied access to audio recordings of SCP-2247's vocalisations. Instead, they are allowed access to transcripts of those vocalisations. 

**Description:** SCP-2247 is a male adult human with light skin. Height and mass are 1.83 m and 75 kg respectively. SCP-2247 is capable of speech in Spanish, but it is unable to comprehend written Spanish. MRI scans indicate no damage to its Broca's area. A barcode-shaped birthmark is imprinted on SCP-2247's left thigh, corresponding to a serial number for products manufactured by Abbott Laboratories.

SCP-2247's physiology is comparable with a non-anomalous human. When SCP-2247's extracted biological matter is displaced from it for at least three minutes continuously, they will undergo transmutation into the following substances with masses equal to the matter originally extracted. 

||~ Biological Matter ||~ Transmuted Substance ||
|| Hair and skin extracted from the head || Polypropylene ||
|| Hair, nail and skin extracted from the body, neck or limbs || Polyethylene ||
|| Body fluids and sub-dermal tissues (e.g. muscle) || Solution consisting of a mixture of sodium thiopental and sodium carbonate ||

Notably, the volume of the transmuted solution is consistently lesser if the sample of body fluids is extracted from SCP-2247's head than from the rest of its body. Reverse-transmutation does not occur when transmuted substances are reintroduced to SCP-2247.  

SCP-2247's verbal communication is restricted to interrogative sentences. To the Foundation's knowledge, it has not yet been observed to vocalise non-interrogative sentences. Individuals who have perceived and comprehended SCP-2247's vocalisations (hereon referred to as 'subjects') become susceptible to SCP-2247's interrogative statements, responding according to respective subjects' factual knowledge and/or sincere opinion on the given topic. 

SCP-2247 was recovered outside the Biblioteca Nacional in Buenos Aires on ██/██/1985, where it was sighted enquiring civilians for directions to any nearby Foundation facilities. Responding to the supposed security breach, Mobile Task Force Alpha-7 ("Security Blanket") was dispatched to capture SCP-2247. 

SCP-2247 surrendered to MTF A-7 without incident after it used its anomalous properties to discern their affiliation with the Foundation. It was subsequently classified as SCP-2247 when medical examinations detected its anomalous features. SCP-2247 was dismissed as an escaped mental ward patient on local media channels. 

**Addendum 2247-1:** Records recovered from Argentine authorities indicate that a person with identical physical and anomalous features with those of SCP-2247 was incarcerated from 1978 to 1982. It was charged with intrusion into a chemical storage room at the Higher School of Mechanics of the Navy (ESMA) [[footnote]] A detention centre operational during the National Reorganisation Process regime. [[/footnote]] in Buenos Aires. The means in which it entered ESMA were unknown. 

Inventory checks conducted after SCP-2247's arrest identified one 500 mg vial of sodium thiopental-sodium carbonate solution as missing; whereabouts remain unknown.  

During its incarceration, SCP-2247 is known to have assisted in the extraction of confessions from prisoners held at ESMA. SCP-2247 vanished on ██/██/1982 while in its cell, escorted by two unidentified intruders. 

**Addendum 2247-2:** Selection of interviews involving SCP-2247

> **Interviewee:** SCP-2247

> **Interviewer:** Agent Pedro de Souza 
> 
> **Foreword:** Interview aims to identify SCP-2247 and its intents, and is originally conducted in Spanish. As its anomalous properties were not yet understood, a non-D-class personnel served as interviewer.

> **Agent de Souza:** For our records, start by giving us your name?

> **SCP-2247:** So Jailors, do you like this demonstration? Do I pass the audition? Where are you guys watching this from? 
> 
> **<End Log>** 
> 
> **Closing Statement:** Interview aborted due to possibility of breach of sensitive information. Due to SCP-2247's anomalous effect, it is suggested that only D-class personnel are allowed interaction with it to minimise breach of sensitive information. SCP-2247's speech appears to be limited to interrogative sentences. It is to be determined if this is of its will or involuntary in nature. SCP-2247 appears to believe itself to be a prospective employee of the Foundation.

> **Interviewee:** SCP-2247
> 
> **Interviewer:** D-2214
> 
> **Foreword:** First interview with SCP-2247 conducted via D-class personnel. D-2214 was chosen due to his prior role as an interrogator for ████████. Interviewer was briefed on SCP-2247's anomalous effects prior to Interview. Interview aims to identify safe means of interaction with SCP-2247, and is originally conducted in Spanish. 
> 
> **<Begin Log>**
> 
> **D-2214:** Hello there. Are you 2247?
> 
> **SCP-2247:** Is that what you're calling me? 
> 
> **D-2214:** Yes. That's what the agents gave me. 
> 
> **SCP-2247:** Did the agents like the audition? Am I hired? 
> 
> **D-2214:** I was not told of any audition, or if you are hired for anything. [pauses] But please, don't speak out of turn. I'm here to know more about you.  
> 
> **SCP-2247:** Why are you people so dismissive of new blood, just like the Process?  
> 
> **D-2214:** I don't know about the Process, but to the people here, you are more of a test subject than worker. 
> 
> **SCP-2247:** What is the job scope of a test subject? 
> 
> **D-2214:** You stay about and let them do their work on you. 
> 
> **SCP-2247:** [frowns] Do you think that is better than being liberated into a [http://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/ boring library] by some self-righteous boludos? And speaking of those boludos, can serpents even have hands? Or what kind of a wanderer owns a library? 
> 
> **D-2214:** Personally, I think freedom is best no matter what; prison sucks. And biologically speaking, [[[serpent-s-hand-hub|serpents do not have hands]]]. And perhaps a wanderer who wants a place to be based at? 
> 
> **SCP-2247:** Would freedom suck if one has nothing to do at all? Would it be best for one to stick to that job one can finally do?   
> 
> **D-2214:** Yeah, that also sucks. And if you like your job, of course. [pauses] Anyway, can you tell me more about this boring library? Was your time there enjoyable? Just nod your head if it was, and shake if it was not. 
> 
> [SCP-2247 shakes its head.]
> 
> **D-2214:** Okay, you can tell why was it not enjoyable, but I need you to be as detailed as possible. The more detailed your question, the more you are helping us. You're here to be helpful to us, yes?
> 
> [SCP-2247 nods its head.]
> 
> **D-2214:** Go on. Why wasn't it?
> 
> **SCP-2247:** What is the point of libraries and books when I can't read a single thing?
> 
> **D-2214:** There's no point being there if you can't read. [pauses] Not bad for a first, but strive for details when speaking from now on. I think the doctors will like it too.  
> 
> [SCP-2247 nods its head.]
> 
> **D-2214:** So you decided that library was not worth it. Why come for the Jailors? 
> 
> **SCP-2247:** Why are the Jailors so popular of a topic among those spoken by the people of the library? 
> 
> **D-2214:** In general, jailors are always a topic to people who have histories with them. [pauses] Okay, so you wanted to return to do your thing again? Nod if yes. Shake if no.
> 
> [SCP-2247 nods its head.]
> 
> **D-2214:** And you see the Foundation as a suitable continuation of your work with the Process. 
> 
> **SCP-2247:** How are the Process and Foundation different from each other?  
> 
> **D-2214:** Not really, in my opinion. [pauses; signal sent to notify D-2214 to conclude interview] Okay, I think we are done for today. Please do not speak another word. You have done well for today. 
> 
> **<End Log>** 
> 
> **Closing Statement:** It is advisable for interviewers to use polar questions when enquiring information from SCP-2247. SCP-2247 should be encouraged to be detailed in its utterances. In addition, it is possible for a listener to express ignorance to SCP-2247's enquiries.
