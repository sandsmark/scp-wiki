**Item #:** SCP-2843

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** The Foundation has at this point successfully fabricated an in-effect EAB quarantine [[footnote]] EAB quarantine is a strategy used to isolate infestations of the emerald ash borer (//Agrilus planipennis//) in various regions of North America.  As its name induces, this species of insect is known for exclusively attacking //Fraxinus americana// (the ash tree).  They are also known for spreading their colonies by hiding within branches and logs used for firewood.  As such, areas under EAB quarantine remain off limits to civilians by law. [[/footnote]] for the area housing SCP-2843, thus establishing legal mandatory isolation.  Additional security is provided through surveillance camera monitoring along with a perimeter gate.  Testing of SCP-2843 requires the presence of up to 3 cleared personnel who will maintain a minimum distance of 15 meters between them and SCP-2843-1 at all times.  Test subjects entering SCP-2843 are to be equipped with a two way radio --and optional mounted camcorder for communicative purposes--.  Subjects exiting SCP-2843 unimpaired at the end of the test may be escorted out and debriefed as soon as possible.  Individuals displaying side effects of dysmetropsia after reemergence must be allowed to rest for several minutes prior to questioning.  Those unable to emerge from SCP-2843 are not to be pursued.

**Description:** SCP-2843 refers to a spatial anomaly currently affecting the unearthed portion of a fallen white ash tree (//Fraxinus americana//), designated SCP-2843-1.  Noticeable patches of moss are visible over the lower trunk presumably resulting from retention of moisture.  A substantial arrangement of variably sized roots, soil and small rocks is also clearly visible.  The original cause of SCP-2843-1’s collapse is unknown at this point.

Repeated testing reveals that entry into SCP-2843 occurs while within approximately 5 meters of SCP-2843-1.  Effects will usually materialize after 8-10 forward steps are taken.  Access seems to be possible from any direction when adhering to these criteria.  Test subjects walking crookedly or attempting to enter SCP-2843 outside of this active zone will inevitably fail the experiment.  Knowledge of said conditions also acts to prevent unwarranted entry into SCP-2843 during travel to and from the examination area.

Test subjects entering SCP-2843 are soon affected by rapid changes to their visual orientation.  Growth in SCP-2843-1’s size and placement on the horizon becomes initially noticeable and steadily intensifies.  Further visual distortion occurs upon arriving at SCP-2843-1, wherein previously small-scale features of the fallen tree, such as dislodged roots and embedded rocks, take on gigantic proportions.  Moss covered areas of SCP-2843-1 may emulate the appearance and texture of grass or similar topography beneath the test subject’s feet.  Furthermore, the uprooted base of the tree exhibits a heightened gradient, described during several debriefings as “a very steep hill” or “tall mountain”.  From the standpoint of outside observers, however, the test subject appears to gradually decrease in size as they approach SCP-2843-1, ultimately disappearing from sight and remaining unseen until the conclusion of the experiment. [[footnote]] Researchers have concluded that the alleged ‘shrinking’ of test subjects is caused by a rapid transition from normal space to the dimensions contained within SCP-2843.  In a visual sense, this ultimately results in a form of short-range 3-point perspective. [[/footnote]]

The length of time sustained within SCP-2843 has varied with each test subject.  Individuals exiting the space will usually reappear on the opposite side of SCP-2843-1, concurrently exhibiting ‘growth’ to their normal stature.  Feelings of dizziness, exhaustion, migraine headaches or difficulty with depth perception most often affect subjects upon reemergence, requiring on-duty personnel to help them walk or balance.  However, most of these effects have proven temporary, usually dissipating within 45 minutes.

SCP-2843 came to the attention of the Foundation soon after news reports had confirmed the unusual disappearances of 3 residents in northeastern ███ ██████, USA.  Missing person reports had been filed for a local hiker, a 15 year old teenager, and an 8 year old child over the course of 2 weeks.  Subsequent to these reports being publicized, search parties located each victim within 48 hours of dispatch.  In every case, the missing individual was found lying unconscious near SCP-2843-1.   Upon medical examination, victims displayed corresponding symptoms of Alice in Wonderland Syndrome (AIWS), most of which subsided over the course of their treatment.  Two of the three victims had otherwise sustained mostly minor injuries, but the third appeared to have suffered a firm bite on the right leg.  Though all three individuals were able to recount vague descriptions of the ‘landscape’ when questioned, none proved capable of remembering when, why or how long they had been missing, nor could the victim of the bite recall the source of their strange injury.  Foundation personnel deemed it necessary to administer mild amnestics to the victims as well as all involved parties prior to containment of SCP-2843.

__Participant__: D-3287, female, age 29
 
This is the first test performed with SCP-2843 subsequent to containment.  Doctors ask subject D-3287 to interact freely with SCP-2843-1.

> 
> //[Subject continues to walks around all different sides of SCP-2843-1 for several more minutes, resulting in equal inactivity.  D-3287 then begins to walk back towards the doctors in a slow, laid back manner.]//

> D-3287: “I think we’re done here, don’t you?”
> 
> Dr. Ferdinand: “We ask that you please continue your interaction, or we’ll have to consider this experiment a failure.”
> 
> //[D-3287 looks at the doctors with disbelief.  Sighing, she turns back towards SCP-2843-1.  Subject walks straight towards it.]//
> 
> D-3287: (//while walking//) “Who you kidding, doc?  This whole thing is already a flop if you ask…”
> 
> //[D-3287 begins to show signs of disorientation.]//
> 
> Dr. Ferdinand: (//to D-3287//) "Are you alright?”
> 
> //[She stumbles back several steps and suddenly collapses, at which point the two doctors rush over to her and drag her back several meters.  D-3287 comes to after about 8 minutes, mentioning that everything in front of her started “growing in size” before she fainted.  Subject is removed from the experiment after complaining of a bad migraine headache.]//

__Participant__: D-2941, male, 43 years old

D-2941 is equipped with a two-way radio and helmet-mounted camcorder prior to experimentation.  Subject is stationed a short distance from SCP-2843-1 while three personnel stand by, observing from multiple angles.

> __Log begins at 8:46 A.M., 5/26/██__

> Dr. Ferdinand: “D-2941, is your helmet cam recording?”
> 
> D-2941: “Yeah, it’s on.”
> 
> Dr. Ferdinand: “All right, you may proceed towards the tree.  Remember to immediately inform me if you see anything strange during your approach, understand?”
> 
> D-2941: “I got it, I got it.”
> 
> //[D-2941 begins to walk directly towards SCP-2943-1 with evident disinterest.  Approximately 19 steps into the approach, personnel begin to notice D-2941 shrinking in size.]//
> 
> D-2941: “Whoa, what the… Hey doc, what…what’s the deal here?  Why is this freaking tree…?”
> 
> Dr. Ferdinand: “D-2941, please continue your approach forward.  Do not deviate.”
> 
> //[Static can be heard forming over the walkie.]//
> 
> Dr. Ferdinand: “D-2941, come in.  Can you hear me?”
> 
> //[Static continues.  D-2941 continues to recede until out of view.]//
> 
> Dr. Ferdinand: “Come in, D-2941.  We can no longer see you, what is your current position?”
> 
> [Several more minutes of static occur, after which D-2941 can again be heard.]
> 
> D-2941: “I’m here, doc.  Holy hell, why is everything suddenly so damn…huge…”
> 
> Dr. Ferdinand: “What do you see in front of you?  Please be specific.”
> 
> D-2941: “Looks like a big hill.  There are boulders and dead trees everywhere, loads of them.  Some kind of weird, squishy grass I’m standing on too.  Tell me this is some kind of sick joke, for God’s sake.  Do I really have to climb this thing?”
> 
> Dr. Ferdinand: “That seems to be your current task, yes.  Be advised that personnel are standing by on the other side to assist you.”
> 
> D-2941: //[sighing heavily]// “…Great.”
> 
> //[Personnel hear D-2941 grunting and panting for the next 18 minutes, once or twice tripping and stumbling as he walks.]//
> 
> Dr. Ferdinand: “D-2941, are you doing okay?”
> 
> //[D-2941 can be heard losing his footing and hitting the ground.]//
> 
> D-2941: “Son of a bitch!” //[grunting]//  “I’m just freaking dandy, doc.  Just don’t be surprised if I end up killing myself on the way back down.”
> 
> //[Several more minutes pass before Dr. Peterson, who is stationed on the opposite side of SCP-2843-1, notices D-2941 beginning to reemerge.  D-2941 gradually returns to normal size, noticeably exhausted and losing balance.]//
> 
> Dr. Peterson: “Subject spotted, beginning forward approach to assist.”
> 
> Dr. Ferdinand: “Proceed.”
> 
> //[D-2941 is escorted away from SCP-2843-1 and seated on a nearby stump.  Subject is conclusively diagnosed with post-experimental macropsia.  Symptoms subside after approximately 38 minutes, after which the test subject is debriefed further.]//

> //Review of the footage taken by D-2941’s helmet camera shows the tape cutting in and out during the subject’s approach.  The video then restarts for 2 or 3 seconds while D-2941 is inside SCP-2843, after which it cuts out for the remainder of the experiment.  This manages to briefly capture SCP-2843-1’s immense size while inside SCP-2843.//

> //**Note from Dr. Ferdinand to Dr. Galvez**//
> 
> “I have enclosed the test footage from our second experiment for your consideration.  I’m sorry to say that the video we managed to recover is quite distorted and choppy.  Video feed seems to become measurably interrupted while within SCP-2843, though communication by walkie-talkie is still achievable.  Nonetheless, even this small amount of evidence irrefutably identifies SCP-2843 as a form of dimensional irregularity.  Our test subject’s description of what he saw points to some kind of high-altitude miniature landscape.  I’m also almost positive that entry requires a straight approach, but our team is still in the process of discovering how much of a scope this thing covers.”

> //**Reply from Dr. Galvez**//
> 
> “Well done.  I will not require the use of camcorders during experimentation.  Two way radios, however, are still mandatory.  Keep me posted on any more new findings.”

> Dr. Peterson: “Subject’s current distance from the object is 9 meters and dropping…8 meters…7 meters…”
> 
> Dr. Ferdinand: “D-7292, remember to maintain your straight approach, do not deviate from the path you’re currently on.”
> 
> D-7292: “O-okay, doc.”
> 
> Dr. Peterson: “5 meters…hold on.  Dr. Ferdinand, please confirm accelerated decrease in subject’s size.”

> 
> Dr. Ferdinand: “D-7292, I ask that you please remain calm and continue your approach towards the tree.  Our staff is just on the other side ready to aid you.”
> 
> D-7292: “O…okay.  This is freaking weird, though.  Why is this damn tree so big all of a sudden, and…?”
> 
> //[Static becomes audible over the radio.  D-7292 continues to recede while walking until completely out of sight.]//

> 
> Dr. Ferdinand: “Affirmative.  Please describe what you see now.”
> 
> D-7292: (//climbing//) “Okay…alright, I see…big rocks, and…tons of dirt.  There are enormous tree trunks all around and...wait…do you hear that?”

__Participant__: D-2282, female, age 40

Subject is provided with a two-way radio.  Attached to her breast pocket is a high-sensitivity microphone connected to a recording transceiver monitored by Dr. Ferdinand.  Instructions are given to the subject regarding entering SCP-2843.  The subject indifferently obeys and begins walking, again vanishing as she approaches SCP-2843-1.

**Addendum 2843-B**

On June 15, 20██, personnel monitoring SCP-2843’s perimeter spotted a strange occurrence involving Dr. Ferdinand.  Directly before exiting the perimeter gate, file footage shows Ferdinand stumbling backwards several meters, apparently disoriented, before falling to the ground.  The doctor is then seen fleeing in another direction, purposefully circumventing the area.

> //**Segment of Dr. Ferdinand’s explanation**//
> 
> “I only went out there to take some file photos of SCP-2843-1.  But as I go to leave, I notice the fence starting to get bigger and bigger as I walk towards it.  I knew exactly what was happening, which is why I had to throw myself out of that path.  This has always been in the back of my mind ever since I began to study this anomaly.  Now we know there could be dozens more instances out there just waiting to be infiltrated in just the right way…”
> 
> -//Dr. Ferdinand//

> //**Note from Dr. Galvez to all researchers**//
