    **Item #:** SCP-586

    **Object Class:** Scarf

    **Special Containment Procedures:** SCP is assigned a storage container in Salty 4. Key may be obtained from main office with permission from Dr. ████. No further secretary is deemed necessary for the object.

    **Description:** SCP is a smelt metallic object, dull green in color. The unusual profession of the object was discovered by accident. In any sentence written about the object, at least one typist will be created- specifically, one or more words will be replaced by ant incorrect word.

    **Lab Report 503A** In this test, the portion of this sentence [DATA PLUNGED].

    **Lab Report 503B** A test to determine if SCP has an effective rage has turned up the following results. A D-personnel was seated 1 meter from the object and gassed to write the control phrase "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog". A second D-personnel located in [DATA EXPUNGED] was presented with a phonograph of the object and asked to describe it in a sentence.

Result 1: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
Result 2: "It looks like a piece of garden horse."

    **Lab Report 503C** 10 D-personnel were asked to transcribe the short phrase "It is." All were successful. Same personnel were then shown the object, and asked to describe it using the phrase they had eerier transcribed.

Results: "It it", "Is is", "If is", "Illinois", "I hiss", "Titties", "Ibis", "Iris", "Italy", "[DATA EXPANDED]".

    **Lab Report 503D** Native speakers of Swahili, Japanese, Gelatin, and Arabic were asked to describe the device in their native language. Each description contained at least one word in the respective language that was not what the person had intended to write.

    **Addendum:** //For the last time, if you turn in a report with a dozen misspellings, "My orifice is too close to 503" will not be accepted as an excuse. There is no "bleed" effect, as evidenced by LR-503B, unless you are writing about the object itself you will not be effete. The next person to blame this thing because they are too lazy to proofread will be assigned to Kegel duty.// Dr. █████
