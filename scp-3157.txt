**Item #:** SCP-3157

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:**  SCP-3157 is to be kept fenced off and guarded by at least seven security officers at any one time, with at least one officer in each sector of the park. Entry to SCP-3157 requires at least Level-2 clearance and direct permission from a staff member of Level-4 clearance or above. Any individuals entering SCP-3157 must be kept under external video observation at all times. 

**Description:** SCP-3157 is the former Holmswood Towers Amusement Park resort following the anomalous events 3157-A and 3157-B (the disappearance and reappearance of the resort, respectively). The site measures approximately 3.7 km² and is located in Stanfordshire, England. 

At 10:32 AM on 16/05/16, SCP-3157 and all individuals on-site disappeared. This disappearance has since been designated Event-3157-A. At the time of disappearance, witnesses say that an auditory shock wave, similar to a thunderclap, oscillated towards the centre of the park across an estimated radius of 1.93km, presumably the result of rushing air particles filling the vaccum temporarily formed by SCP-3157's sudden disappearance. 
Following the event, a crater was left in SCP-3157's place, with all cables, water pipes and phone lines left exposed, seemingly severed. 

No anomalous features were found on the site of SCP-3157 following Event-3157-A. After the Foundation began investigations, the site was fenced off. The remaining cables, pipes, etc, were removed. 

At 3:40 PM on 07/05/17, SCP-3157 returned to its original position, an occurrence designated as Event-3157-B. Again, an auditory shockwave was reported by Foundation personnel on site at the time, however this wave was observed to have radiated from the centre of the park as oppose to towards it. Similarly, this shockwave oscillated across an estimated radius of 1.90km. 
No survivors, bodies, or anomalous properties were discovered in the newly recovered SCP-3157, except a notebook and pen found on a platform next to the park’s "PURGATORY" roller-coaster.

The notebook (labelled as SCP-3157-1) and pen are pieces of park merchandise. Material found in the notebook is believed to be a suicide note written by the last remaining survivor of Event-3157-A. [SEE DOCUMENT-3157]. 

As of ██/██/██, there have been three attempted acts of trespassing into SCP-3157. 
The first, occuring on ██/██/16, and second, occurring on ██/██/17, (both between Events 3157-A and B) were committed by members of the public attracted to the site through its national and global media coverage. Both groups were detained by the Foundation for 24 hours before being released. 
The third, occurring on ██/██/17, (shortly after Event-3157-B) was committed by ██████ ████, mother of █████ ███, a supposed survivor of Event-3157-A believed to have committed suicide [SEE DOCUMENT-3157]. She was detained by the Foundation for 24 hours before having information from SCP-3157-1 shown and explained to her. She was later released and found dead in her home by family members. The death was ruled as a suicide by authorities. 

No further anomalous events have occurred in or around SCP-3157 since.
