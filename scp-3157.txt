**Item #:** SCP-3157

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:**  SCP-3157 is to be kept fenced off and guarded by at least nine security officers at any one time, with at least one officer in each sector of the park. Entry to SCP-3157 requires at least Level-2 clearance and direct permission from a staff member of Level-4 clearance or above. Any individuals entering SCP-3157 must be kept under external video observation at all times. 
Any members of staff attempting to enter SCP-3157 without authorisation are to be dismissed immediately.

Any other individuals found trespassing SCP-3157 are to be detained for a period of 24 hours, after which they must either be released or have further action taken against them based on their actions and/or behaviours on-site. If further action is deemed necessary, it must be authorised by SCP-3157's site director before it can be put into effect.

Standard media blackout operations are to be put into effect should any form of media outlet release information regarding SCP-3157 and/or Events-3157-A and B.

**Description:** SCP-3157 is the former Holmeswood Towers Amusement Park resort following the anomalous events 3157-A and 3157-B (the disappearance and reappearance of the entire resort, respectively). The site measures approximately 3.7 km² and is located in Staffordshire, England.

The park itself is divided into nine separate sectors, each with a specific theme which rides, buildings and pathways are decorated to match. Each sector holds one of the park's nine major roller coasters, excluding the entrance sector, which holds none, and the Devil's Land sector, which holds two. A system of footpaths link all the park's sectors, although a monorail and cable car system also operated across several sectors.

At 10:32 AM on 16/05/16, SCP-3157 and all individuals on-site disappeared, an occurrence since designated Event-3157-A. At the time of disappearance, witnesses say that an auditory shock wave, similar to a thunderclap, oscillated towards the centre of the park across an estimated radius of 1.93km, presumably the result of rushing air particles filling the vacuum temporarily formed by SCP-3157's sudden disappearance. 
Following the event, a crater was left in SCP-3157's place, with all cables, water pipes and phone lines left exposed, seemingly severed. 
No anomalous features were found on the site following Event-3157-A. After the Foundation began investigations, the site was fenced off. The remaining cables, pipes, etc, were removed. 

Following the event, standard media blackout operations were put into effect, though due to Event-3157-A's scale, over 20 different national media outlets had already reported the event. This, paired with the significant effects of Event-3157-A (including the disappearance of an accounted 29,871 people), has resulted in many individuals in the U.K. and some beyond still having knowledge of SCP-3157, despite Foundation efforts. At the time of writing, it is unknown exactly how many individuals have knowledge of SCP-3157 and Event-3157-A, though it is estimated to be around at least 300,000 nationwide. 

At 3:40 PM on 07/05/17, SCP-3157 returned to its original position, an occurrence designated as Event-3157-B. Again, an auditory shock wave was reported by Foundation personnel on site at the time, however this wave was observed to have radiated from the centre of the park as oppose to towards it. Similarly, this shock wave oscillated across an estimated radius of 1.90km. 
No survivors, bodies, or anomalous properties were discovered in the newly recovered SCP-3157, except a notebook and pen found on a platform next to the park’s "PURGATORY" roller-coaster, located in the 'Devil's Land' sector of the park.

The notebook, labelled as SCP-3157-1, and pen are pieces of park merchandise. Material found in the notebook is believed to be a suicide note written by the last remaining survivor of Event-3157-A, who remains unidentified. The note seems to suggest that survivors were trapped on the site following Event-3157-A, and lived there for several months, presumably the time between Events-3157-A and B. Despite this, no evidence of survivors living on the site has ever been found.

Again, standard media blackouts were put into effect. However, due to the Foundation's now established control over SCP-3157, fewer outlets were able to report the event, thus less people are assumed to have knowledge of Event-3157-B, although the site is located only 0.8km from a main road, so can be easily observed by members of the public.

No further anomalous events have occurred in or around SCP-3157 since.
