**Item #:** SCP-3157

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** The site of SCP-3157 is to be fenced off from the public and guarded by at least seven security officers at any one time. Entry to the site requires at least Level-2 clearance and direct permission from a staff member of Level-4 clearance or above. Any individuals entering the site must be kept under external video observation at all times. 

**Description:** SCP-3157 is the former location of the Holmswood Towers Amusement Park resort following the anomalous events 3157-A and 3157-B, the sudden disappearance and reappearance of the entire resort. The site measures approximately 3.7 km² and is located in Stanfordshire, England. 

On the 16th of May 2016, at approximately 10:32 AM, the entire site disappeared, including all individuals present on the site at the time of disappearance, which has since been labelled Event-3157-A. At the time of disappearance, witnesses say that a small shock wave was sent out from the centre of the park across an estimated radius of 1.93km. Following the event, a crater was left on the site in the resort's place, with all cables, water pipes and phone lines left ripped out, torn from their appliances as if the entire site itself had been ripped from the ground. 

No anomalous features were found on the site following the disappearance. After the Foundation began investigations, the site was fenced off and kept under guard. The remaining cables, pipes, etc., were removed, but the crater was left.

On the 7th of May 2017, the entire park returned to the same position it was previously located in, known as Event-3157-B. Again, a small shockwave was reported by Foundation personnel on site at the time. The site was promptly investigated, where no anomalous properties or features were discovered except a notebook and pen found on the ground of a platform next to the park’s "PURGATORY" roller-coaster.

The notebook (labelled as SCP-3157-1) and pen are pieces of park merchandise from one of the several gift shops found across the resort. Material found in the notebook is believed to be a suicide note written by the last remaining survivor of Event-3157-A. [SEE DOCUMENT-3157]. No bodies were found, nor any evidence of survivors living on the site (as DOCUMENT-3157 seems to suggest); after Event-3157-B, the park was left in almost pristine condition, as if nothing had happened to it since the disappearance. 

After final inspections of the site were completed, the park was demolished and the site remains under guard by the Foundation. No further events or anomalies have occurred or appeared on the site since, although safety precautions have been put into place should any similar events occur.

We coudln’t starve  to death, the whole park reset after each day so we had a permanent supply.  We made it  work,somehow. Then [REDACTED] killed himself. Jumped off the mansion. Can’t say I blame him. Loads more followed. 
> Mothers jumped with their children. To end their suffering, they all said. all lined up on the hills and the roofs of the park, all jumping. No one could  handle it. Afterwards, there were just 76 of us  left. We managed to get past it. God knows what we would have done if the bodies hadn't disappeared with the reset. Eventually, we went on the rides. Like the kids. Like all the dead kids. They always stayed functional, so we could ride what we wanted when we wanted. It was fun for the last few months. Then the next disaster happened. The rides killed everyone.

[[footnote]]This prose appears to come from a message that plays during the start of the PURGATORY ride; "No way out, no happy ending. Only eternal darkness. This is Purgatory."[[/footnote]]
