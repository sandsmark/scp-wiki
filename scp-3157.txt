**Item #:** SCP-3157

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:**  SCP-3157 is to be kept fenced off and guarded by at least nine security officers at any one time, with at least one officer in each sector of the park. Entry to SCP-3157 requires at least Level-2 clearance and direct permission from a staff member of Level-4 clearance or above. Any individuals entering SCP-3157 must be kept under external video observation at all times. 
Any members of staff attempting to enter SCP-3157 without authorisation are to be dismissed immediately.

Any other individuals found tresspassing SCP-3157 are to be detained for a period of 24 hours, after which they must either be released or have further action taken against them based on their actions and/or behaviours on-site. If further action is deemed necessary, it must be authorised by SCP-3157's site director before it can be put into effect.

**Description:** SCP-3157 is the former Holmswood Towers Amusement Park resort following the anomalous events 3157-A and 3157-B (the disappearance and reappearance of the resort, respectively). The site measures approximately 3.7 km² and is located in Stanfordshire, England. 

At 10:32 AM on 16/05/16, SCP-3157 and all individuals on-site disappeared. This disappearance has since been designated Event-3157-A. At the time of disappearance, witnesses say that an auditory shock wave, similar to a thunderclap, oscillated towards the centre of the park across an estimated radius of 1.93km, presumably the result of rushing air particles filling the vaccum temporarily formed by SCP-3157's sudden disappearance. 
Following the event, a crater was left in SCP-3157's place, with all cables, water pipes and phone lines left exposed, seemingly severed. 

No anomalous features were found on the site following Event-3157-A. After the Foundation began investigations, the site was fenced off. The remaining cables, pipes, etc, were removed. 

At 3:40 PM on 07/05/17, SCP-3157 returned to its original position, an occurrence designated as Event-3157-B. Again, an auditory shockwave was reported by Foundation personnel on site at the time, however this wave was observed to have radiated from the centre of the park as oppose to towards it. Similarly, this shockwave oscillated across an estimated radius of 1.90km. 
No survivors, bodies, or anomalous properties were discovered in the newly recovered SCP-3157, except a notebook and pen found on a platform next to the park’s "PURGATORY" roller-coaster.

The notebook, labelled as SCP-3157-1, and pen are pieces of park merchandise. Material found in the notebook is believed to be a suicide note written by the last remaining survivor of Event-3157-A [SEE DOCUMENT-3157]. The note also seems to suggest that survivors were trapped on the site following Event-3157-A, despite no evidence of survivors living on the site ever being found. 

No further anomalous events have occurred in or around SCP-3157 since.

**Addendum 1:**
As of ██/██/██, there have been three attempted acts of trespassing on the site of SCP-3157. 
The first, occuring on ██/██/16, and second, occurring on ██/██/17, (both between Events 3157-A and B) were committed by members of the public attracted to SCP-3157 through its national and global media coverage. Both groups were detained by the Foundation for 24 hours before being released. 
The third, occurring on ██/██/17, (shortly after Event-3157-B) was committed by ██████ ████, mother of █████ ███, a supposed survivor of Event-3157-A believed to have committed suicide [SEE DOCUMENT-3157]. She was detained by the Foundation for 24 hours, during which she had information from SCP-3157-1 shown and explained to her. After her period of detainment, she was released. The morning following her detainment, on ██/██/17, at 10:32 AM, she was found dead in her home by family members. Authorities have since ruled her death as a suicide.
