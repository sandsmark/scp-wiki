**Item #:** SCP-3157

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** The site of SCP-3157 is to be fenced off from the public and guarded by at least four security officers at any one time. Entry to the site requires at least Level-2 clearance and direct permission from a staff member of Level-4 clearance or above. Any individuals entering the site must be kept under external video observation at all times. 

**Description:** SCP-3157 is the former location of the Holmswood Towers Amusement Park resort following the anomalous events 3157-A and 3157-B (the disappearance and reappearance of the resort, respectively). The site measures approximately 3.7 km² and is located in Stanfordshire, England. 

At 10:32 AM on the 16th of May 2016, the resort and all individuals on-site disappeared. This disappearance has since been designated Event-3157-A. At the time of disappearance, witnesses say that a small shock wave, similar to a thunderclap, was sent out from the centre of the park across an estimated radius of 1.93km. Following the event, a crater was left on the site in the resort's place, with all cables, water pipes and phone lines left exposed, seemingly severed. 

No anomalous features were found on the site following the disappearance. After the Foundation began investigations, the site was fenced off. The remaining cables, pipes, etc., were removed. 

On the 7th of May 2017, the park returned to its original position, designated as Event-3157-B. Again, a small shockwave was reported by Foundation personnel on site at the time. No anomalous properties or features were discovered on-site except a notebook and pen found on the ground of a platform next to the park’s "PURGATORY" roller-coaster.

The notebook (labelled as SCP-3157-1) and pen are pieces of park merchandise from one of the several gift shops found across the resort. Material found in the notebook is believed to be a suicide note written by the last remaining survivor of Event-3157-A. [SEE DOCUMENT-3157]. No bodies were found, nor any evidence of survivors living on the site (as DOCUMENT-3157 seems to suggest); after Event-3157-B, the park was left in almost pristine condition, as if nothing had happened to it since the disappearance. 

After final inspections of the site were completed, the park was demolished and the site remains under guard by the Foundation. No further events or anomalies have occurred or appeared on the site since, although safety precautions have been put into place should any similar events occur.
