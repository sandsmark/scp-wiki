**Item #:** SCP-3157

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** The former site of SCP-3157 is to be closed off from the public and guarded by at least seven (7) security officers at any one time, with at least one officer in each sector of the park. Entry to the site requires at least Level-2 clearance and direct permission from a staff member of Level-4 clearance or above. Any individuals entering the site must be kept under external video observation at all times. 

**Description:** SCP-3157 is the former Holmswood Towers Amusement Park resort following the anomalous events 3157-A and 3157-B (the disappearance and reappearance of the resort, respectively). The site measures approximately 3.7 km² and is located in Stanfordshire, England. 

At 10:32 AM on the 16th of May 2016, SCP-3157 and all individuals on-site disappeared. This disappearance has since been designated Event-3157-A. At the time of disappearance, witnesses say that a small shock wave, similar to a thunderclap, was sent out from the centre of the park across an estimated radius of 1.93km. Following the event, a crater was left on the site in the resort's place, with all cables, water pipes and phone lines left exposed, seemingly severed. 

No anomalous features were found on the site following the disappearance. After the Foundation began investigations, the site was fenced off. The remaining cables, pipes, etc, were removed. 

At 3:40 PM on the 7th of May 2017, SCP-3157 returned to its original position, designated as Event-3157-B. Again, a small auditory shockwave was reported by Foundation personnel on site at the time. No survivors, bodies, or anomalous properties were discovered on-site except a notebook and pen found on a platform next to the park’s "PURGATORY" roller-coaster.

The notebook (labelled as SCP-3157-1) and pen are pieces of park merchandise. Material found in the notebook is believed to be a suicide note written by the last remaining survivor of Event-3157-A. [SEE DOCUMENT-3157]. 

No further anomalous events have occurred in or around SCP-3157 since.

[[footnote]]This prose appears to come from a message that plays during the start of the PURGATORY ride; "No way out, no happy ending. Only eternal darkness. This is Purgatory."[[/footnote]]
