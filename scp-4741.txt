**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4741 is contained onsite in an enlarged humanoid containment chamber built around it on Storage Site-124. Any paper generated by SCP-4741 is to be reviewed once every 2 weeks. One researcher is to interview with SCP-4741-1 regarding any excerpts of interest.

**Description:** SCP-4741 is a human skeleton seated on a wooden picnic bench. On the bench rests an Underwood 3 Standard Portable Typewriter (matching with typewriters manufactured by the Underwood Typewriter Company from 1919 to 1929), whose anomalous property is the means of generating a seemingly infinite supply of uncoated paper when SCP-4741-1 interacts with the object. 

The skeleton (designated as SCP-4741-1) is a semiautonomous sapient being capable of seeing and hearing individuals in spite of its lack of organs or organic material apart from hollowed bone. The only movement made by SCP-4741-1 is from its arms and fingers, and only the act of typing has ever been observed. The bench, the typewriter and SCP-4741-1 are all immobile; no attempts have succeeded in moving any parts of SCP-4741 or otherwise damaging it. SCP-4741 is fixed to its point on earth permanently though these anomalous means. 

SCP-4741-1 claims they were formerly Timothy Watkins, an English man who immigrated to Canada in 1924 and went missing in 1937 at the age of 30. Further investigation is required to confirm this.

SCP-4741-1 has repeatedly shown knowledge of events which happened millions of years before its original corporeal existence. The entity has also shown knowledge of events that are theorized to be in the near or distant future. Currently, it is not known how this information manifests in SCP-4741-1, as the predictions are delivered through the passages of a novel (designated as SCP-4741-4) that SCP-4741-1 writes daily. The 4000-page series of chapters allude to the aforementioned predictions with varying degrees of accuracy.

**Addendum SCP-4741-B9:**           
On 06/08/2018, the following excerpt was taken from SCP-4741-1's writings.
 
> When her eyes met his, she felt her heart soar above the clouds. As she soared through the air she felt as if nobody could see the sky the way she could. The great expanse of purple was laid out before her, and a light protruding from the ground emanated the sweetest sounds. When she was around Tim, her worries would clear away as the clouds did on that fateful day. Truly, it was a time of love.

The excerpt is believed to relate to an incident that happened one day after the initial writing. On the Niagara Escarpment at 06/09/2018 6:00 pm, members of the GOI-████ were found to be engaging in a process that led to a temporary CK-Class Reality Restructuring event. However, the completion of the said process was halted after an MTF squadron posted at Site-124 at the time intervened. 

An interview with SCP-4741 was subsequently conducted:

I am writing a request to alter the current containment procedures for SCP-4741. Based on recent events and the general behaviour of SCP-4741, I feel it is unnecessary for us to conduct further interviews regarding the validity of any statements within the writings of SCP-4741. A simple storing of the excess paper the entity generates in a low-security locker with suffice for the upkeep of SCP-4741's chamber. 
@@ @@
SCP-4741-1 has demonstrated no interest in assisting the Foundation in any way. At the present moment, almost no information the entity has provided to us has been "entirely" true either. We cannot even believe if it's as old as it says it is. I feel that it is safe to say that we do not need to continue these unnecessary communications with SCP-4741-1 any longer.

Mr. Stefan,

I have received your request, and decided to decline. SCP-4741's procedures will be changed however, but not to reduce communication. We have seen that SCP-4741-1 is unwilling to cooperate with the Foundation,  but it is my firm belief that it is still possible to change the current situation we are in.
@@ @@
After reading your request, I decided to review the information we have about SCP-4741. It appears the entity had been in our containment for a mere 8 years, despite it claiming to exist for 70. This kind of discrepancy should not have gone so easily unnoticed, even in the older days of this site. It appears that the anomaly has been feeding a lot of lies to us on purpose, to trick us into believing he is useless in an effort to make us not bother communicating with them.
@@ @@
I believe we need to negotiate with SCP-4741-1. We have to convince him to provide more information for us through a not-so-equivalent exchange, of sorts. Any promises made do not have to be followed through, they only need to make SCP-4741-1 believe we are fulfilling them.
@@ @@
Despite its behaviour, an asset like 4741 is still extremely useful to this site. You already know what happened close to here with the sky. We do not want a repeat of that, so please do all you can to convince SCP-4741 to share a bit more.

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4741 is contained onsite in an enlarged humanoid containment chamber in Storage Site-124. Any paper generated by SCP-4741 is to be reviewed once ##blue|every week.## A researcher is to interview with SCP-4741-1 ##blue| if they believe the excerpt shows signs of predicting supposed anomalous events. All communication with SCP-4741-1 is to be surveilled and reviewed properly. Foundation personnel are prohibited from communicating to SCP-4741-1 about the current containment procedures for SCP-4741, or the state of its “novel”(designated as SCP-4741-4). ##

##blue|Should communications between SCP-4741-1 become tedious or ineffective, a “new deal” shall be proposed to the entity. These deals include the release of SCP-4741-4 in certain foreign markets, the publishing of further sequels to SCP-4741-4, or the live-action movie adaptation of one of the instances of SCP-4741-4. Following through on these promises should not be considered of high priority, but making SCP-4741-1 believe the Foundation has done so is crucial. ##

##blue|If predictions of certain dangerous anomalous events made by SCP-4741 have been deemed to be highly probable by no less than three Level-4 personnel (two personnel are to have not had any regular contact with any part of SCP-4741) and the current Site-124 Director, reasonable measures shall be taken to either surveil or prevent the event's occurrence.##

**Description:** SCP-4741 is a human skeleton seated on a wooden picnic bench. On the bench rests an Underwood 3 Standard Portable Typewriter (matching with typewriters manufactured by the Underwood Typewriter Company from 1919 to 1929), whose anomalous property is the means of generating a seemingly infinite supply of uncoated paper when SCP-4741-1 interacts with the object. 

The skeleton (designated as SCP-4741-1) is a semi-autonomous sapient being capable of seeing and hearing individuals in spite of its lack of organs or organic material apart from hollowed bone. The only movement ever observed from SCP-4741-1 is in its arms and fingers, and only the act of typing has ever been observed. The bench, the typewriter and SCP-4741-1 are all immobile; no attempts have succeeded in moving any parts of SCP-4741 or otherwise damaging it. SCP-4741 is fixed to its point on earth permanently though these anomalous means. 

SCP-4741-1 claims they were formerly Timothy Watkins, an English man who immigrated to Canada in 1924 and went missing in 1937 at the age of 30. Further investigation ##blue| has confirmed this to be false. SCP-4741 currently believes that their novels have been successfully published in multiple countries (currently the USA, Canada, and England), received multiple writing awards as well as critical acclaim and appraisal. The Foundation has provided false trophies and signatures that currently sit on the bench to enforce this belief further. Before the discussion of a new deal, it is believed that SCP-4741-1 had been withholding information about the extent of its abilities for fear of SCP-4741-4 being leaked to the public before the "release" of it. ##

SCP-4741-1 ##blue|possesses ##knowledge of events which have happened millions of years before its original corporeal existence. It has also shown knowledge of events that ##blue| have occurred or will occur in the surrounding area of Tobermory, ON. As of 12/17/2018, 100% of predictions confirmed by SCP-4741-1 have come to fruition. These events can either be prevented or changed if an individual knew of the event’s occurrence before it has happened. ##

**Addendum-4741-F7:** 
##blue| On 11/24/2018, SCP-4741 produced an excerpt which was believed to allude to a possible breach of containment by outside individuals. If the event had occurred, it would have resulted in the loss of several items and staff members. The excerpt reads as follows: ##

> Katherina saw Tim lay flat on the ground, his blood slowly pooling as the gunshots of the camo soldiers against the guards echo in the site. 
> 
> “Run Katherina, this is not the place for you. I n-need you to live... b-because... I love you.”
> 
> But now was not the time for love. It was time for REVENGE. She grabbed her pistols and ran full speed toward the assailants, guns-blazing and fury pumping through her veins. The pencil-pushers who had trapped them here had fallen like the snow that their coats were coloured. The only arrows that she cared about now were the exit signs.

##blue| An interview was summarily conducted regarding the excerpt: ##

##blue|After the interview, the necessary preparations had been made to prevent Site-124 from experiencing a possible breach. On 11/28/2018, members of GOI-███ staged an attack on the site, losing all known participants in the process. Circumstantial evidence has led the Foundation to conclude that if preparations had not been established in advance, several SCP objects' containment protocols would be compromised. Subsequently, this breach would result in several deaths and a temporary breach in the veil. The decision to preemptively equip the site for the assault based on SCP-4741-1’s prediction resulted in saving considerable amounts of resources for the Foundation. ##

##blue|Due to this, SCP-4741’s object classification and containment procedures have been updated to reflect the new interview process.##
