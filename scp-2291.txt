**Item #:** SCP-2291

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2291 is stored in Anomalous Item Locker ECD-2291 in Site 19. As direct physical contact with SCP-2291 is prohibited, only D-Class personnel are authorized to move the item. Research involving SCP-2291 is prohibited without the express permission of Dr. Mbeke or Site-19’s senior administrative staff.  Individuals that touch SCP-2291 directly are to be designated SCP-2291-A, administered a Class B amnestic, and placed into confinement for 3 months or until cleared by a supermajority of Site-19's psychiatric panel. Individuals that still show symptoms after this period are to be terminated.

**Description:** SCP-2291 is a corrugated cardboard box with a edge length of 15cm. The word “FUN” is printed in large, black capital letters on each side. There are no gaps or joints on SCP-2291's surface, suggesting that it was formed whole rather than being folded from a flat sheet. D-Class personnel report a rattling noise issuing from SCP-2291 when moved, suggesting that it contains one or more smaller objects. All attempts to access SCP-2291's interior via destructive means have failed, as have imaging studies intended to probe the interior. Level-3 personnel and above may request Test Logs 2291 -1 though -4 for more details.

SCP-2291 was recovered from the offices of █████████ Corporate Solutions in ███████, Ohio. Foundation assets were alerted after the entire staff of █████████ Corporate Solutions was reported missing within a period of 2 days. Mobile Task Force Rho-9 ("The Dundies") was assigned to investigate, and recovered SCP-2291 along with 18 instances of SCP-2291-A, identified as the former employees of █████████ Corporate Solutions. These individuals were found at their workstations, suffering from sleep deprivation and mild dehydration. 

Direct physical contact with SCP-2291 is to be considered a Delta-class cognitohazard. Those who do so are to be designated SCP-2291-A and experience the following symptoms:

* All communication by SCP-2291-A instances is altered. SCP-2291-A instances involuntarily replace some adjectives, especially those involving emotion, with the word “fun”. 
* SCP-2291-A instances smile constantly, even while sleeping.
* SCP-2291 significantly alters how SCP-2291-A instances express and experience emotion. Immediately after initial exposure, subjects report increased feelings of happiness and significantly reduced resistance to authority. As the time of exposure to SCP-2291 increases, however, symptoms change; subjects repeatedly exposed to SCP-2291 for a period greater than 2 weeks become reliant on SCP-2291's effects to experience pleasure. When isolated from SCP-2291, these subjects temporarily lose their ability to normally process endorphins. In addition to a suppressed ability to experience pleasure, these individuals experience symptoms analogous to extreme doses of Naloxone in opiate abusers; restlessness, sweating, and headache are common.

When isolated from SCP-2291, SCP-2291-A instances typically recover within 3 months. Recovery is negatively correlated with exposure time; the less time a subject spends near SCP-2291, the greater their chance of recovery.

**Interview Log 2291-17-3:** The first 18 known SCP-2291-A subjects were the employees of █████████ Corporate Solutions, all of whom were detained during the recovery of SCP-2291. The following interview has been deemed notable due to its content.

[[collapsible show="+ Interview Log D-14783-7" hide="- Interview Log D-14783-7"]]
> **Interviewed:** D-14783
> 
> **Interviewer:** Dr. Mbeke
> 
> **Foreword:** D-14683, a former paralegal, was chosen for testing with SCP-2291. To test the long-term effects of SCP-2291 on subjects similar to the employees of  █████████ Corporate Solutions. D-14683 was asked to complete a small amount of legal paperwork after each hour of exposure. The following interview was performed 3 months into SCP-2291 exposure.
> 
> **<Begin Log>**
> 
> **Dr. Mbeke:** Hello, D-14783. How are you today?
> 
> //D-14783's tone suggests unhappiness. He remains smiling.//
> 
> **D-14783:** Fun.
> 
> **Dr. Mbeke:** What do you mean by that? You sound sad.
> 
> **D-14783:** I don't have enough to do. I have to keep working. Can you guys give me more to do?
> 
> **Dr. Mbeke:** I'll see what we can find for you. Tell me, why do you feel like you need to work so much? 
> 
> **D-14783:** I have to be fun. When I'm not writing, when I'm not getting things done, I just get this sense of emptyness. Don't get me wrong, whenever I'm near that little box thing, I feel great. But even then, I feel almost guilty about not working. When I'm not around it, the feeling just gets worse. The only way I can feel like myself is to work.
> 
>**Dr. Mbeke:** Thank you, D-14783. That will be all.
> 
> **<End Log>**
> 
> **Closing Statement:** D-14783 did not show any progress in recovering from the effects of SCP-2291. He reported consistent worsening of psychological symptoms as time of exposure increased. He found dead in his cell 4 months and 12 days after the above interview. Cause of death was ruled to be blood loss resulting from suicide, as D-14783 had repeatedly carved the word "fun" into his chest and left forearm with a screw taken from his cot. Due to this incident, further long-term studies with SCP-2291 are prohibited.
