**Item #:** SCP-3473

**Object Class:** --Euclid-- Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3473 is currently contained within a 10 kilometer perimeter of Site-190, which is located in the area known as "█████ ██████" in the █████████████ Desert. This Site’s main buildings are subterranean, located 2 kilometers beneath the surface and designed to withstand high intensity radiation and temperatures, as well as substantial seismic activity. On-site personnel are not permitted to leave the site if SCP-3473 is within 3 kilometers of the entrance.  

A secondary bunker is located 13 kilometers from the main facility, outside of the Site’s perimeter. Permission for the construction of additional “satellite facilities” around the perimeter border is pending.

--SCP-3473 is to be contained, when possible, in a cell with dimensions of 10 X 10 X 10 meters. Each of the cell walls of the containment chamber are to be made of at least 5 meters of lead located between an internal 1 meter layer of titanium/tungsten alloy, coated with silica aerogel that is to be replaced bi-weekly, and 3 meters of steel-plate reinforced concrete externally.-- As of the events of 3473-NE-7-WGU, containment of the entity within facilities is no longer considered a valid option. The entity is now restricted to the 10 kilometer radius around Site-190, which is considered its containment area for all intents and purposes.

Should SCP-3473 come within 2 kilometers of Site-190, or go beyond the 10 kilometer perimeter, a detachment from Mobile Task Force Omega-47 (“Sunscreeners”) are to be dispatched from either the main site, or the offsite secondary bunker, whichever is closest to the entity, and meet with it at a safe distance to guide it back within those boundaries. 

If the entity is within the 2 kilometer radius of the entrance, it may have adopted this position intentionally to attempt to prompt communication with on-site staff. If this is confirmed to be the case, it should usually be allowed to do so as long as it does not enter the Site proper, and must be monitored by the MTF until it returns to its safe boundaries. Beyond this, because SCP-3473 does not sleep, 24 hour surveillance is required and operated via the use of multiple long-range observation drones, as well as satellite tracking. 

All on-site personnel, including members of MTF Omega-47, must don a Grade-1 Hazard Suit in preparation for possible interaction with SCP-3473. All permanent on-site staff within the perimeter must be fluent in sign language and semaphore to communicate with SCP-3473 at both close and long distances. Interaction with SCP-3473 should always be performed at a distance of no less than --10-- 15 meters.

**Description:** SCP-3473 is an entity reaching almost three meters in height, which is vaguely humanoid insofar that it has a head, two arms and two legs connected to a central body. However, similarities to humans are few beyond this. Its body is androgynous and lanky in form, although it usually takes a hunched stance, and its limbs are long and thin. Each limb is tipped with three digits resembling talons. It has a thick neck and large toothless maw that continuously remains open for unknown reasons. It has no nose or ears, but does have yellow eyes that lack any apparent pupils.

Four long, thin, antenna-like projections grow from the creature's head, and two more grow from its shoulders, in addition to fin-like structures on its back, arms and legs. These are assumed to be sensory organs, although their exact means of function are not currently known. Its skin is usually luminescent orange in color, but shifts to either a dull reddish hue during the night or a bright yellow during midday, in respect to time-zones in its current location. These color shifts can also be brought about when the ambient temperature changes, as well as when the entity is feeding or agitated. The exception to this is a series of symmetrical, black, exoskeletal plates that cover large portions of its body.

The surface temperature of the entity's body is approximately 1100°C on average, with the black patches at its extremities being the coolest at slightly under 600°C. Its mouth is the hottest area on its surface, reaching 3000°C on average. This is by no means the hottest the entity can become, however, as it reaches many times these temperatures when feeding or when agitated. As of writing this, its internal temperature can only be guessed at, as no currently available technology is durable enough to withstand the measurement processes. 

SCP-3473 is capable of a form of levitation, and is able to suspend itself roughly a meter in the air. How it does this is currently unknown, but research indicate it may utilize vented heat or directional manipulation of gravity.

The entity emits intense radiation in addition to heat, which can only be partially screened by use of Grade 1 "Heat and Radiation" Hazard Suits. The exact composition of the radiation the entity emits appears to change based on multiple factors. Time of day, ambient temperature and the composition of what it has recently consumed all seem to have an impact, but ir is generally composed of ultraviolet, gamma and x-ray radiation, although alpha and beta particles, other electromagnetic waves and free protons are also emitted in smaller amounts. As of yet, genetic or medical information (if such things are even applicable) about SCP-3473 beyond physical description are unobtainable due to its volatile form. 

SCP-3473 is sapient, and while it is incapable of audio-based perception and cannot communicate verbally, it has excellent eyesight and is fluent in the use of sign language and semaphore (which it was taught as its methods of communication with Foundation personnel). SCP-3473 is also seemingly able to sense the presence of objects and places which emit abundant electromagnetic or ionizing radiation. How it is able to do this remains unclear. It does not possess any apparent sexual organs. Despite this, it seems to identify as male and uses masculine vocabulary when referring to itself. Foundation personnel are permitted to use such terms during informal communication with the entity.

General intelligence tests have determined that SCP-3473 has the same mental capability as an average adult human, although its behavior and personality are more akin to that of an inquisitive child. It has yet to offer much insight as to its origin or species. When questioned about these topics, it will usually point towards the Sun's location in respect to its current position, doing so with absolute precision even if the Sun is not visible. The entity usually does not elaborate further, either expressing confusion or irritation if pressured.

SCP-3473 eats regularly and can consume anything it comes into physical contact with. The mechanism by which this occurs is observed to be as follows: it raises parts of its surface temperature to extremely high levels, vaporizing and energizing nearby matter into a plasma state in the process, and then uses anomalous gravitational acceleration to draw the energized matter inside of its body, usually into its maw. 

It will not actively seek to consume humans or other life forms, but it has proven capable of destroying and absorbing any mundane matter from its environment. Anything it consumes appears to be collected and utilized internally via controlled atomic reactions, which are assumed to be a form of nuclear fusion, with any waste being excreted from its body as an increase in emitted radiation for a period of time after consumption. Current scientific principles cannot explain these processes which, on the scale they occur, appear to break understood laws of physics and conservation of energy.

Due to SCP-3473’s abilities, complete containment is currently impossible. It is only possible to contain SCP-3473 because it willingly chooses to remain in Foundation care. All attempts to trap or restrain the entity, to date, have proven futile and further attempts are not currently permitted. SCP-3473 understands that it is currently held in containment for its own safety and the safety of others. It is also generally agreeable and is aware that mere exposure to its body is harmful to life. 

Despite this, it has expressed repeated desires for more space to wander, and to interact with staff so that it may learn more about the world, or simply enjoy socialization. While direct interaction is permitted, on site personnel must be firm in enforcing that it stays within its perimeter. Thus far, this has stopped it from fully breaching containment. However, should the entity, at some point in the future, leave its containment perimeter and refuse to return, **[DATA EXPUNGED]**

Staff communicating with SCP-3473 must be polite and non-threatening to it, as perceived threats can trigger an agitated state in the entity. If SCP-3473 experiences significant emotional stress, the levels of heat and radiation it emits will begin to rise exponentially. Should SCP-3473 become sufficiently agitated for a sufficient length of time, it may trigger a "Nova Event". It was originally believed to be a form of defense mechanism, but the entity claims this is not the case, stating that it does not understand them itself and finds them distressing. Current hypothesis is based on the idea that it is more akin to a panic attack or seizure.

When a Nova Event occurs, SCP-3473's body temperature reaches extreme levels many times above the norm, unleashing massive amounts of heat, ionizing radiation and gravitational distortions into the surrounding area. The level of destruction varies, with the most intense Nova Event to date having an output roughly equivalent to that of a 20 kiloton nuclear bomb, although it is theorized that **[REDACTED]** even greater levels. Part of the basis for this theory is the fact that Nova Events occasionally have the same effect as solar flares on the reformation of  [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1246 SCP-1246]. 

Should SCP-3473 show signs of distress, agitation, anger or uncharacteristic hostility, Foundation staff are advised to attempt to calm the entity for a period of no more than 2 minutes if already in contact. If not already in contact, or should this agitated state persist in spite of attempts to calm it, Site-190 is to be put into a lock-down state as per “Ignition Protocol” in response to a potential Nova Event. The bulkheads within Site-190 are to be sealed for the duration of such an event, and all other staff within the surface perimeter must evacuate to the offsite bunker, if possible. 

Nova Events also vary in duration. While the shortest on record lasted only 7 seconds, and most only last a couple of minutes, the longest recorded unbroken Nova Event lasted for 2 days and 11 hours. This resulted in the complete destruction of Site-91, the facility where SCP-3473 was kept at the time. Over 90% of on-site staff, multiple anomalous objects contained on the site and much of the surrounding landscape were destroyed in the process. This particular Nova Event is now referred to as 3473-NE-7-WGU, and lead to a redefining of the entity's containment procedures, as well as its reclassification to Keter.

It should be noted that the on-site warheads were triggered as a result of the WGU event (due to damage caused by the event itself rather than manual activation), but had no discernible effect on SCP-3473 aside from presumably causing an increase in duration and intensity of the event.

When it becomes apparent that a Nova Event is imminent, on-site staff are to employ “Ignition Protocol." After a confirmed event has ended, clean-up crews will then be sent in from off-site to both locate the SCP as well as assess and (if possible) repair damage it has caused. Until an "All Clear" is given, no on-site personnel are to leave Site-190 after a Nova Event. 

Nova Events will leave the entity in an exhausted and traumatized state afterwards, and it is top priority that the SCP be calmed by staff as soon as it is safe to do so, to minimize chances of a relapse. To date, there have been █ recorded Nova Events, including WGU. 

**Acquisition:** SCP-3473 was recovered thanks to a sweep of the ██████ Desert area. Reports of a relatively large meteor landing in the area had sparked the attention of locals as well as government agents. The Foundation was the first to reach and contain the area.

SCP-3473 was discovered in a scorched crater in the ███████ part of the desert. Foundation members initiated standard intelligent life protocols and made contact with SCP-3473. It followed Foundation forces to the nearest secure Site, but had to travel on foot because the response team were not equipped to transport high-heat/radiation loads.

Of note, when it was first encountered, its entire body was reported to have a charred, rocky appearance, and gave off a smell similar to burning coals. Over time it “shed” this outer crust of its body, and developed into its current form, which it has remained in ever since.

> 
> **3473:** Pretty good. Saw a group of flying creatures in the sky this morning.
> 
> **Researcher Mako:** A flock of birds? That's a rare sight to see out here.
> 
> **3473:** Yes. Only see you most of the time. You speak of "animals", but these are the first I have seen. (3473 pauses and seems to shrug, a gout of steam hissing from its maw.) So fast and free. Reminds me of...times before.
> 
> **Researcher Mako:** (Pauses.) Before? Could you elaborate? You've never talked about this kind of thing previously.
> 
> **3473:** (Thins its eyes and more steam hisses from its mouth, this time aggressively. 3473 seems to be irritated, as it pulses with a bright glow and ambient temperature in the area starts rising.) I have explained many times. You seem not to understand even when I clearly show. Aren't you human "doctors" meant to be smart?

> **3473:** No. You just keep asking until I explain. One moment. (The glowing pulses and rising heat subside and 3473 looks up to the sky for a moment, before looking back.) Father says I am allowed to speak more truth.
> 
> **Researcher Mako:** Father?
> 
> **3473:** Yes. Birth was long ago, far from here. Mother died at birth, so I drifted for so very long. Was cold and alone, but was also free like the birds in the sky. The solar winds carried me far, until eventually I was brought before Sauel, my father. Mother's dying act was to send me to him, and he spoke of her so fondly. A love so bright, from so far away. And I drifted now at his side, but for a time too short. (3473 pauses and seems distressed.)

> **Researcher Mako:** May I ask what happened?
> 
> **3473:** I cannot remember what it was...but my path came undone, and I ended up drifting away from father. I was scared. Called out to him, to [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-179 her][[footnote]]The full nature of the relationship between SCP-3473 and COEWS-179 has not been determined, aside from them both referencing the name Sauel. COEWS-179 has not yet delivered any messages regarding SCP-3473, either signaled or via satellite, and SCP-3473 refuses to speak on the subject. Further research into both anomalies is required.[[/footnote]], to anyone...but none could help me. I drifted to this rock you call "Earth", and now I'm trapped here. Father's voice is so quiet and distant...I feel alone again...and now no longer free.

>  //“Alright, now you've all read the above file at face value, let me be honest. Most of you with half a brain in the physics department have probably figured this out already, but I'll spell it out for the rest of you.//
> 
>  //Those bio-hazard suits? They’re pretty much there for morale of on-site staff and not much practical use beyond that. The amount of ionizing energy 3473 emits, even in its more "agreeable" states or at the so-called “safe distance”, is very much unsafe. With enough exposure over time (usually a couple of years at most,) it becomes lethal. Problem is that the damn thing is a social creature and all but requires and demands interaction with others. If we don't have a nice chat every so often, it could melt through the walls, walk down here and ask why we are ignoring it. I've thought about using D-Class as middle men, but honestly the risks involved aren't worth it. What if they aggravate it intentionally or act smart and try and turn it on us? Most of them assume they're going to die anyway, and might see this as a means to take some of us down with them.//
> 
>  //Controlled and friendly social interaction has been shown to have a positive effect on reducing the likelihood of Nova Events, as well as reducing the chances of it wandering beyond containment out of boredom or curiosity. And of course, no one wants a repeat of WGU. As such, I’d take increased rates of cancer, burns and radiation poisoning in the staff stationed here over the possibility of this thing wandering off into the desert and heading towards a populated area. On that subject, there's another truth I also want to share with you. Currently we have no backup plan in place in the event that 3473 decides to just walk off and refuse to come back. This is not an oversight, it's because none of us have any clue how to restrain this thing beyond a firm telling off. Its child like mentality plays into our hands here, but it's getting smarter all the time, and eventually it might figure out that we can't actually control it, which would be catastrophic.//
> 
>  //And before any of you give me smart suggestions about trying to "freeze" or "extinguish" this thing, let me remind you that it's not a camp-fire; it's a small living star for all intents and purposes. If we submerged it in liquid nitrogen, it would only give it more fuel to burn and grow hotter, not colder, and changing the ambient temperature or placing it in a vacuum won't stop the nuclear fusion happening within it. With all this in mind, for the time being, I hope you all understand that this is the best possible way. It's not pretty, easy or comfortable, we didn't sign up for that, did we?”//
