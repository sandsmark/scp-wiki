OC, or the [[[http://scp-foundation-origins.wikidot.com/run-schedule| Oneiroi Collective]]], is a hive-mind entity located in metaphysical space. It is a collective unconscious utilizing the brainpower created by sleeping things. It has been known to manifest in physical space as inanimate and organic objects which interact with dreamspace in a way that favors Oneiroi. This has been disputed by some, as identifying 'favorable' outcomes implies an obvious motive or method of behavior, neither of which has been conclusively found across scholarly studies of Oneiroi.

Any schemes, motivations, or specific entities identifying as part of Oneiroi are unknown and probably don't exist. 

Formats to interact with the collective have been documented to resemble contemporary media outlets. This has been confirmed as a lie. The [[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_occupation_of_Yugoslav_territories| cornfields of the mind]]] are too vast for any trawler to manage on their own. The interfaces are not of the world, they are a reflection of you. You are too shallow to get it in return.

Locations where Oneiroi exists includes all of them. To be less general, here is a list of where some are:

* In the cold spots of the world that only the hardy can survive in. They are known to have many occurrences of dreams containing sunshine kisses in their margaritas.
* [[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Theresa_of_Spain| King Louis XIV]]] of France, both before and after he lost his virginity.
* Every barstool.
* Rick DiPietro's broken dreams, and the shattered hopes of the entire [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-1467249/forum:thread| New York Islanders Hockey Club]]] fan-base.
* Scott Wilkins, and all the people of Scottland. From the highlands to all of your diaspora in the lower hairs, we have you, Scottland. You are ours.

The first known mentions of the Oneiroi Collective can be found in [[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheWanderersLibrary?from=Main.TheWanderersLibrary| Classical Greek mythology]]] where it was a dream-related entity. Since then, it has been found throughout everything. It got into everything before we even knew about it. There are many contemporary organizations with members participating in Oneiroi, and a few of them are even aware of it. There are many negative consequences to these and your interactions with the Collective. If you suffer from its grasp, that sounds bad.

In 2014, the Oneiroi Collective was nominated for the 121st annual 'GCCX' Award given for [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/salman-corbette-personnel-file| absolute fucking pointlessness]]].

[[collapsible show="Would You Like To Know More?"]]

The Oneiroi Collective is a collective consciousness of dreamers and dream entities which exist in a metaphysical reality formed of these connected minds. Apart from that, it can be all over the place. There's no single GoI format, but if you look at stuff like #Xiupania you can see that generall goi format articles are going to look like stuff from twitter, tumblr, the news, etc. Even this hub is supposed to invoke Wikipedia.

So if you want to write for Oneiroi, the sky really is the limit. Dmatix wrote about them as a predatory entity, that hungers for dreams. I wrote them as sort of a lifeline connecting the physical world to the dreamlands through telephone connections, and Kate wrote them as a wish-granter with a dark side. The only real consistent thing here is for it to be dream based, whether that be through location, effect, or something else is up to you.
