> 
> **Dr. Penelope:** Good morning SCP-15000-J, today I would like to ask you a few questions, I hope that's okay with you. 
> 
>  **SCP-15000-J:** //[Chuckling]// Of course, but before we begin, how was your Butterfingers with your McNuggets last night?
> 
>  **Dr. Penelope:** How... How do you know about that? 
> 
>  **SCP-15000-J:** It was simple, you have five stains on your coat, but I didn't smell anything in your breath indicating you ate breakfast.
> 
> **Dr. Penelope:** Now that is some bullshi—
> 
> **SCP-15000-J:** Tch tch tch, so quick to anger, but now, I know everything about your personality! You're the type to hate your position in society!
> 
> **Dr. Penelope:** That's a mere generalization. 
> 
> **SCP-15000-J:** But is it? This morning you... You were forced to get your inconsiderate boss some coffee after you bumped your head on a door. You were probably thinking "Why do I have to get this moron some coffee, I should be in charge."
> 
> **Dr. Penelope:** That's... That is not true.
> 
> **SCP-15000-J:** But it is, this morning while you fixed him coffee you spit in it! 
> 
> **Head Research Campe:** She did what? 
> 
> **SCP-15000-J:**  But that wasn't your first time, you did this several times, you even did [DATA EXPUNGED].

> 
> **Dr. Samuel:** Hello SCP-15000-J, I would like to ask why did you um... expose D— Junior Researcher Penelope. 
> 
>  **SCP-15000-J:** Expose, is that what you call it? I didn't expose anyone, that was just simple mental exercise. 
> 
> **Dr. Samuel:** A exercise for what? 
> 
>  **SCP-15000-J:** //[Looking up]//... Until the time I reach the pinnacle of the one above all. 
> 
> **Dr. Samuel:** Could you please elaborate?  
> 
> **SCP-15000-J:** Elaborate, why should I? What are you tr... Hehe, I see now. 
> 
> **Dr. Samuel:** You see what?

> 
>  **SCP-15000-J:** Why are you leaving so early, Chaos Insurgency?
> 
>  **Spy:** How do you know about that? 
> 
> **SCP-15000-J:** It was simple, this organization must have enemies, I watch too much tv not to know that and while you were in here you didn't write down notes immediately, you waited five seconds do it! 
> 
> **Spy:** But how did you come up with a name?
> 
> **SCP-15000-J:**  SCP Foundation has 13 letters and this is my second interview, so 2 plus 13 equals 15 and what has 15 letters, Chaos Insurgency.
> 
> You see, I trained my mind for five years on a specific mountain in a specific region to increase my mental power. On that mountain, I had learned the art of seeing with your eyes. With this power, I could deduce anything about you by just the way you walk. But of course, not anyone can use this power, only the wisest and greatest of minds could dre—

> **Interviewer:** Doctor Abbot Daniel. 
> 
> **Interviewee:** SCP-15000-J
> 
>  **Foreword:** Interview #6.  Doctor Abbot Daniel submitted forty-five complaints against SCP-15000-J stating that is exposing  'secrets' of personnel that it interacts with, subsequently decreasing site morale, and it was not anomalous. They were granted an interview with SCP-15000-J to prove this statement.

> 
> **Dr. Daniel:** //[Slams several photos of SCP-15000-J working in walmart]// Explain this.
> 
>  **SCP-15000-J:** Clearly, that is me working in WalMart. 
> 
>  **Dr. Daniel:** Yeah, but you said 10 years ago you went to the 'mountain' to train. But, the time doesn't match up; here you are, 10 years ago, working in WalMart. 
> 
>  **SCP-15000-J:** Your point?
> 
> **Dr. Daniel:** You're not anomalous, you're just a toothpick con man! You didn't train with wizards, monks, or hillbillies, you're just good at... doing things; and so, you don't belong here and you need to be amnestized immediately!

> **SCP-15000-J:** //[Laughing under its breath]//
> 
> **Dr. Daniel:** //[Sweating]// What's so funny?
> 
> **SCP-15000-J:** You see, //Doctor Abbot Daniel//, I was the one who made those //fake// pictures!
> 
> **Dr. Daniel:** That's impossible, these were discovered under high tec—
> 
> **SCP-15000-J:** Hush child, I deduced that this will happen 10 years ago when I was training on that mountain. I knew my abilities would be so great that there would be haters coming after me. So I made fake pictures that prove to my haters that I was wrong and they were right, but in reality, they would be proving that I was right and they were wrong. 
> 
> To answer your question that was the reason for my laughter. 
> 
> 
> **Dr. Daniel:** //[Laughing under his breath]// 
> 
>  **SCP-15000-J:** Hm, what's so funny?
> 
> **Dr. Daniel:** You see SCP-15000-J, I made those photos today!
> 
> //SCP-15000-J  gasps and stumbles back.//
> 
> **SCP-15000-J:** That just can't be, I... I deduced it. 
> 
>  **Dr. Daniel:** You deduced nothing but your own downfall!
> 
> **SCP-15000-J:** Hehe,  but you see I went into the //mountain dew section//, so a mountain nonetheless.
> 
> **Dr. Daniel:** ... No! We are all tired of your //deduction//, you just want to fuck with people, and we are through with you.

>  //Two Junior Researchers embarrassed by SCP-15000-J walks in the room and hold down SCP-15000-J.//

> **SCP-15000-J:** Get your hands off me! //[Dr. Daniel takes out a needle and injects it within SCP-15000-J.]//
