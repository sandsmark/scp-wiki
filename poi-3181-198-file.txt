This is it. My Magnum Opus. And you know what? It did actually feel that way! After 5 months of work on this concept (I joined the site because of this idea), 1 failed post (I got impatient and just wanted to see how it'd do in a half-done state) and many, many times of thinking "I should finish that sometime" I had finally gotten my first SCP up on the site. And it got +50 in under a week. That was amazing, and I still feel truly grateful for all the help I got for it. More info regarding its conception is in the author post.

This one was written by [[*user DevonMartin]] together with me for CollabCon 2k19. It started out as a standalone idea Devon already had, then turned into something extremely convoluted including MC&D until we took a step back and revamped it, removing MC&D and making it much simpler.

This is the Prequel to SCP-4714 and was done in a similar fashion. As explained in the author page Devon had to do most of the work here (and also did a great job at it) and I am really thankful he stuck with me through such a turmoiled writing process. I feel a bit of shame to put this here as I would have really liked to leave more of my own mark on it, but I am still proud of the end product.
