title:Bazyliszek
**Warsaw**
**1944**

Another airdrop had been intercepted by the enemy. The English had good intentions, but when those ended up being consistently dropped into German territory, one could not help but wonder if  if they were //trying// to miss the zones occupied by the Home Army. And they had just dropped it in the worst possible location.

Basilisk Street was simply a name that her platoon had given this area. It may have had another name, once, before the Germans had razed it. The road looked familiar to her; she had visited it several times when she was younger, but she could not recall the name. She knew it had a bank on it, and a baker's shop, which had once been a knifesmith's house, centuries ago.

The relevance of this last point was not lost on anyone in the platoon. Stefania, with her brown hair and broad Polish face, was flanked by two others. Tolek, who had been designated their sniper, hefted a rifle that looked too big on the young man's frame, like he was a little doll that someone had stuffed into a uniform. Kazia didn't look much better; years of starvation had taken toll on their grenadier, but she had bounced back from it, and what she lacked in fat she made up for in athletic muscle, enough that she could lug at least ten of the improvised grenades they had made, along with her rifle. They had all ducked behind a shell of a building,  some bomb-out walls barely supported by the foundations, as they waited for the return of their final member.

Their saboteur, Odekta, was returning from scouting ahead, crawling on the ground laboriously. She swallowed, and looked at Stefania with wide eyes. On her coat, she wore what she considered a badge of honor: a yellow six-pointed star. She looked up at them, remaining prone. "They're not looking at the supply drop."

"What?" Kazia spoke up, in a hissed whisper. "That has to have five days worth of food in it. Why would they not even inspect it?"

"They're more focused on one of the buildings. I've seen three Szkopy go into it, but none have come out."

"What building?" Stefania took out her binoculars and surveyed the area. "Everything is rubble."

"Not so much a building, but the cellar of one." Odetka paused. "...you've told us about the second war before, Stefania. The one being fought next to this one."

Stefania's hand squeezed around the binoculars. "A war of magic. I didn't believe it, either, until I saw what happened in the telephone building." She swallowed, remembering the taste of burning flesh when a man covered in intricate Nordic tattoos had incinerated two members of her squad, before she put a bullet in his stomach, and then five in his skull.

"Everyone knows the myth. You don't suppose it could still be here?" Tolek's voice was a timid squeak, almost drowned out by the sound of a distant explosion; a small one, a grenade that had been tossed, perhaps.

"...if it is, we feed them all to it and seal up the chamber." She moved out from behind cover, staying low to the ground. "Odekta, how many smoke grenades do you have?"

"Three of them."

"Three?" Stefania frowned. "You were given five. You used one to escape the patrol on Świętojańska, what happened to the other?"

"Defect in the casing," she explained, taking out the container of metal-cleaner that served as a shell for a grenade. There was a hole that had formed in the bottom seam of the can. "Pressure and contents leaked."

"Wonderful." Stefania signaled to her companions to stay low, crawl if they had to. This was easy for Tolek, but poor Kazia had a significantly bigger target on her with the grenades strapped to her back. Their plain clothing mixed in well with the rubble, so that provided some coverage. From this distance, any Nazi without binoculars or a scope would have thought they might have been scraps of paper being blown about in the breeze.

Slowly, they approached the end of the street, as the September sun crept overhead. Gunshots rang out an indeterminate distance away, and somewhere, another church in the city wavered on its foundations.

------
With the pace they were going, it was over two hours by the time they had arrived at the other end of the street. They had to duck into alleyways, hide in buildings, and piss on the rubble of what had once been a dress shop. They were too poorly-equipped to charge in alone, with or without grenades. Tolek looked like he was going to vomit at any point during the journey; Stefania guessed that his fear of dying outweighed the nausea. 

Eventually, they reached the end of the street, seemingly undetected. Five soldiers and one commander stood before a hole in the ground that had once been the entrance to a cellar, rectangular, with metal doors on either side dented and off the hinges; it may have been hit directly by a small bomb. They were accompanied by a pair of dogs, who had their attention trained on the hole. Behind them, an airdrop crate stood, covered by a parachute, forgotten. 

Stefania's eyes widened as she realized that they had brought dogs with them, and between Tolek's whimpering and their own stench from crawling in the sun for so long, they would soon be found out. She suppressed a swear, signaled to her platoon to be at the ready, and steadied her rifle on a pile of rubble that had once been a windowsill, ready to take aim at whatever noticed them first.

Instead, the dogs were given a command in German: "Go!". The two dogs ran into the hole, and some time later (Stefania's heart was beating so fast that it could have been anywhere from two minutes to an hour), one of them emerged, running and whimpering. Through her scope, Stefania saw that its eyes were shut. Then, eventually, it came to a stop by the Germans' transport, came to a halt, and fell over, dead.

That confirmed it, then. Basilisk Street lived up to its name. The cellar of a building, torn down to rubble, once more contained a creature that could kill with either its eyes, or its teeth. A perverse combination of rooster and reptile.

The Basilisk of Warsaw had never died. Or rather, maybe this was a descendant? Some youngling, hatched from an egg that had lain dormant until the bombs woke it up? Was the city itself deciding to punish its invaders by recreating something that had been the terror of the city so many hundred years ago?

She could not be sure. She gave another signal to Kazia to ready a //Filipinka//; an impact grenade. They were clustered together enough that a bomb would take out at least one of them. To Tolek, she signaled to come with her, and helped him ready his rifle next to her own. Odetka readied her own smoke grenade to choke out whoever survived the initial blast.

With a pointing of her finger. Kazia threw the bomb. Chaos ensued as the casing shattered on the backs of one of the Germans, killing him before anyone could react. Another had his arm torn to shreds, and writhed on the ground, screaming. The rest had turned their attention to the rebels.

Odetka's smoke grenade sailed almost in tandem with Kazia's //Filipinka//, and landed at their feet, causing them to choke and stumble. Nazis were dangerous in groups, but like all soldiers, they could be an uncoordinated mess if they were ambushed.

Stefania's shot entered the heart of a third trooper as he stumbled from the fog, and he gasped as his spine exploded outward behind him. Tolek managed to hit the knee of a fourth, and as the final two gained their composure enough to draw their pistol, Kazia let another //Filipinka// sail towards them.

Stefania ran out from behind cover to a barrier the Germans had erected, then to another, and finally, to the jeep they had been next to. The others followed in a staggered formation, with Tolek at the back.

"What are you doing?" Kazia hissed. "They're going to be checking up on the explosion. We could have snipers above us at any minute! Let's just grab what we can from the drop and go!"

"The Basilisk is real, Kazia," Stefania growled in return "We can't let them get it, and if they're not getting it... well, the Home Army could use a... how do the Americans say? Trump card?"

"You're not serious," Odetka gasped, having opened up the crate; she was starting to stuff chocolate rations in her bag. "Stefania, that thing will kill you, //if it is real//. How do you even intend on bringing it out?"

"Szkopy are evil, but they're not completely without sense." She looked into the transport, and found, in the back, a cage made for large poultry, and within, a large set of flaps around a thick loop, all leather.

"What is that?" Tolek frowned as she removed it from the container.

"Blinders," Stefania hissed. "I saw them used in a falconry demonstration before the war broke. They cover a bird's eyes. Perfect for the thing down there."

"It will kill you in an instant!" Protested the youngest member. Poor Tolek was shaking again. "Please, I can't. We can't lose you, Stefania."

"It can't kill me if it doesn't look me in the eyes."  She rummaged in the back more, and found several implements; large, unwieldy black spectacles, an apron covered in mirrors, an electric torch, and a long stick with a loop on the end, no doubt for going around the thing's neck. "The glasses will buy me some time, at least."

She wasted no time in dressing herself, leaving behind her rifle and taking only her sub-machine gun. If necessary, she would kill the beast. She held the torch in one hand, rake in the other, and descended into the cellar.

------

The room was far too large to exist under Warsaw. Stefania had been underneath some other buildings in this area -- she did some of her education in the basement of a now blown-out apartment building not a block from here-- and using her torch, she could not see the walls. The air was cold, and reeked of petrichor; it was almost as if she was in a cavern. She aimed her light upwards, and could not see the ceiling.

And so, she shuffled through the darkness. She had a pain, a mounting dread, that she had only felt twice before: first, when she heard that Hitler had pushed his forces through Poland, and was aiming at the rest of Europe. Second, when she faced down a man using... she still hesitated to call it magic, in the PAST telephone building. He had incinerated two of her compatriots by waving his hand, and in the process, melted what few still-intact relays remained into slag.

She had suspected the basilisk had existed; a good few squadrons had gone missing in the area of Basilisk Street. It was supposedly where the myth of the basilisk took place. It was one she knew by heart: the knife-smith's children being found dead in the cellar of a collapsed building, the nursemaid dying to the basilisk's gaze when she went to retrieve them, the wise doctor instructing on how to destroy it, the convicted man's expedition...

Nobody ever knew what happened to the beast itself. A ghost story by her neighborhood said that, every time you saw a new statue around the city, it was a victim of the basilisk. It was just a myth...

But that didn't change the fact that, one-hundred meters away from where the September Sun was shining down, Stefania Borowski was standing over a dog whose eyes had swollen to the size of hen's eggs, and whose skin seemed ready to burst open; poking it with her noose caused an effluence of pus onto the floor of the cave.

She heard something skitter behind her.
------

Tolek bit down on a cracker ration he had taken from the supply drop. He would give the rest to the people at base camp, but for now, this was his. The Americans made the best crackers; they were made with honey, or something else sugary. 

Kazia couldn't help but give him an admonishing look between setting up traps of //Filipinka// attached to poles at either end of the street. When someone walked by, they would knock into them, and the grenade would explode on contact with the ground.

They all looked at the way into the cellar. Stefania had just left, but it filled them with unease. Warsaw was an old city, over 700 years old. Poland was even older. It had much buried beneath its stones, old conflicts, attempted takeovers, tyrants that marched through and stepped on the scythes of the people. The bombing, the siege five years ago, and now the Uprising might be bringing it all back to the surface.

"Where are you, //Tula//?" Odetka chewed at her finger, keeping her sub-machine gun aimed at the entrances. Poor range, but the fire could at least cause some to scatter, or set up the impact grenades Kazia was setting up.

"//Heh low the hair!//" cried a voice in an American accent. All three of them jumped at it, aiming their rifles. From out of a building (which Kazia, with a curse, realized had a back entrance in an alley behind the street.) came three men in black uniforms, the leader a blond man wearing black leather gloves.  "//Sprichst du Deutsche? Noh, uf korz knot.//"

"State your purpose!" Kazia growled, firing a warning burst with her gun. 

"//Yew hidyot//," growled another voice, this one from a more diminutive man with black hair and a Polish widow's peak. He had a more natural accent. "He's asking if you speak German, he's an American," this one said in Polish.

"We don't speak //Szkopy!//" Kazia growled. "We've got you outnumbered, and we have a secret weapon."

The Pole translated for the American. "The Basilisk, yes?"

"...yes," Tolek swallowed. "How did you know?"

"We sent Stefania here to retrieve it."

------

Stefania kept her eyes shut, relying on her hearing to listen for where the basilisk was skittering to and fro. She had gotten a look at its body; just like the legend said, a rooster with a lizard's tail and claws. She couldn't help but wonder if it was hatched from a cock's egg, like her grandmother said.

She swung around wildly with the noose on the pole, trying to grab any part of it. She remembered what the American -- she thought he was a reporter -- told her. This creature was dangerous, and if it couldn't be destroyed, it could at least be locked in a cage, contained, until the war was over and it could be properly studied.

The temptation was there, in the dark, as the cavern echoed around her with the sound of silence. The basilisk didn't caw, didn't chirp, didn't crow like a cock. It just ran about on its little feet, and occasionally tried to peck at her. 

She just had to turn the mirror-lined apron at it for long enough for it to be stunned by its own reflection. Not killed, just stunned, the American had told her that. He worked for some Foundation. International, he claimed, trying to stop two wars -- the war she fought, and the war that was fought with espionage and esoteric knowledge, not sabotage and sniper rifles. An Occult War, he called it.

She heard the basilisk coming from her left. She turned, slowly, even as it came at her faster. If she spun too fast, the mirrors would warp with the apron, and the basilisk would not be stunned. Turn to fast, and the basilisk would be scared and flee for another attack. Too slow, she would be pecked to death by a venomous chicken.

The basilisk came up on her. She turned, noose wand extended

------

"Why would Stefania agree to this?" Odetka sounded skeptical. "She should keep it for the cause."

"And risk losing her own force?" asked the translator. "She could kill everyone in the resistance, from the lowliest peon to... you call her Jaga?"

"Lt. Mileska," Tolek nodded. "She's nice. She's cared for us."

The American nodded and spoke more things nobody understood, until the translator spoke, pointing to the trapdoor. "Things are faster down there."

"Faster?" Tolek asked. 

"Time moves faster. She could have been down there for quite a while now." The translator looked at them. "Warsaw is a messy city. Both of the wars are making it messier. Once she's out, we must--"

"You must //what?//" Stefania asked, emerging from the underground with a basilisk, blinders over its eyes, trapped in a noose wand.

"Stefania!" the American smiled, switching to German. Something they could both speak. "It's good to see you again! You have your prize?"

"...yes," Stefania replied in the same language. To her compatriots, it must have sounded like she was speaking in some kind of tongue used by snakes. "You'll keep it safe?"

He nodded back towards the jeep. "We have a cage in there."

Everyone's heart sank. Stefania's blood became volcanic, and her vision bore holes into the side of the transport. "You're a //German organization?//"

Tolek yelped, and covered his ears, curling into a ball. The conversation had taken a turn for the worse; though he spoke no German, he could tell that from the tone alone.

"It's a matter of convenience!" the American pleaded, realizing where Stefania's hand was going. "They have better equipment, we can move through freely through the occupied zones!"

"Szkopy were here earlier, trying to get it out of the hole themselves."

"They were looking for it as well! We wanted to get it first!"

"They were going to use this as a weapon!" She stared at him hard enough that even the basilisk in her hand could have turned to stone. "How do I know that you aren't?"

"Y-you don't," the American swallowed. "Please, don't do anything rash--"

The others realized where her hand was going. Kazia pleaded. Odetka begged, and shut her eyes a fraction too late. Tolek had simply curled up on the street, as if a bomb was coming for him.

Stefania pulled the blinders off of the basilisk.

------

Tolek Lisiewicz was left alone on the street. He crawled towards Stefania, eyes still clamped shut, and felt her calcified legs. She, too, had looked into the eyes. Perhaps intentionally, perhaps inadvertently. But it mattered not: she was dead. So was everyone else in the street, except him. 

He felt his way up her body, mumbling apologies the whole time, until he came to the basilisk, trapped between her tight, stone-encrusted hands. He felt for the neck.

He found it. 

His hands twisted in opposite directions. The Basilisk of Warsaw was no more. 

Eyes still clamped shut, sobs suppressed and swallowed, he limped his way back down Basilisk Street, fearing that if he looked back, if he even opened his eyes to blink, he would put a picture to the horrific sound that he heard from the instant he snapped the basilisk's neck.

Tolek heard screams, barely muffled by stone. Of them, Odetka's was the loudest. 

------

Underneath Basilisk street, in a disused cellar, an egg laid by a rooster began to hatch.
