**Item #:** SCP-714

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:**
SCP-714 is to be stored in a reinforced, high-security locker that is to be accessible only to Level 4 personnel, due to several incidents of misuse. It requires no exorbitant or unusual security measures otherwise, however.

**Description:**
For all intents and purposes a normal, unremarkable and simple green jade ring, SCP-714 has been shown to be able to expand and contract to fit any subject perfectly, though this is the least important of it's properties. The size of SCP-714 when not worn varies, dependent upon the last subject to come into contact with SCP-714. The band thickness of SCP-714 remains constant regardless of it's size.

When SCP-714 is worn on any finger of a subject, the subject feels worn out, wearied, and tired. Subjects exhibit considerably hindered reflex times, lowered mental capacity and sluggish movement, incapable of moving faster than a slow walking pace. Subjects are also capable of completely ignoring shocking, disturbing, grotesque or otherwise mentally damaging images or scenes with no or significantly reduced ill effect, and report feeling the impulse to "sit down and rest for a bit", moving toward the nearest, most easily accessible and most comfortable piece of furniture within 25 meters. Subjects then proceed to sit down and relax, occasionally politely requesting nearby personnel to retrieve simple items such as food, drinks and books or magazines for them. Requested personnel report feeling compelled to do so, but are unable to specify the exact reason for this compulsion when questioned. If no suitable furniture is present, subjects will attempt to fashion a suitable resting place out of blankets, pillows, cushions and other soft, stray furnishings.

Additionally, subjects possess heightened resistance to psychic suggestion, control or domination and even physical restraint, brushing off these forms of interference in a polite but terse manner. Additionally, subjects show enhanced pain and chemical resistance, as demonstrated by one Class D subject who displayed a marked increase in resistance to tranquilizers whilst wearing SCP-714.

It should be noted that certain "mind-bending" inanimate SCPs and animate SCPs with subliminal suggestion are still capable of causing mental damage to subjects wearing SCP-714 if they are sufficiently powerful, though effects are markedly reduced and in some cases completely nullified. Subjects show no heightened resistance to physical trauma however, and this is where SCP-714's impact upon reflexes becomes near-fatal, as subjects are unable to protect themselves from speeding objects either by blocking or evading.

The manner in which SCP-714 causes this effect is unknown - no unusual emissions, radiation or emanations of any kind can be detected, and no unusual properties have been discovered in it's construction. SCP-714 may be broken like any other jade ring (though it requires somewhat more force) and it's effect ceases. If the pieces of SCP-714 are placed within close proximity, they will gradually reform back into a whole copy of SCP-714, flowing as if made of liquid, though it is without a doubt still solid. Once SCP-714 is fully reformed, it's functions return as if it was never damaged. Grinding SCP-714 down to a fine powder did nothing to impede it's reformative behaviour either, though the process did take considerably longer. The nature of this self-repair behaviour has not been determined as of this time, though SCP-714 could theoretically recover from complete vaporization, however due to SCP-714's mundane nature this has been deemed an unnecessary use of resources. Footage sequences of SCP-714 reforming from various states of disrepair are available upon request from Dr. █████.

Subjects who do sit down and rest for a bit gradually recover from the effects, but require removal of SCP-714 to recover fully. Recovery from SCP-714' effects take no longer than normal exhaustion, though issuing stimulants is not recommended. Subjects that fall asleep under the influence of SCP-714 will not awaken until SCP-714 is removed from them, though they report feeling 'pleasantly rested' once wakened and suffer no noticeable exhaustion beyond having just been woken up. Stimulants are incapable of countering the draining effects of SCP-714 unless extremely strong - their effects will be considerably dampened if strong enough - though their effects are suddenly unimpeded once SCP-714 is removed from the subject, including potential overdose scenarios.

Attempts to track the history and ownership of SCP-714 have proven futile due to the nature of it's recovery; Agent ████████ reported feeling abnormally drowsy even after several mugs of strong coffee, and was found to be wearing SCP-714 with no memory of having come into possession of it. Agent ████████ has been reprimanded as appropriate, and measures have been taken to ensure SCP-714 stays in it's locker at all times.

The draining effects and compulsion to rest make use of SCP-714 as a protective measure against certain SCPs highly impractical. At this time SCP-714 is not believed to have any other serious effects, beyond the danger of dehydration and starvation of personnel who fall asleep wearing SCP-714, being unable to rouse themselves for sustenance.

**Addendum:**
//"SCP-714 is not to be used on unwitting Class D's just so you can see them miserably fail to protect themselves from physical harm. Have some standards, people."// - Dr. █████

//"Trying to use SCP-714 to weasel your way out of work either by intentionally falling asleep with it on, using it to take an extended break in the lunchroom or attempting to return home early due to 'exhaustion' will result in harsh penalties being dealt out."// - Dr. █████

//"I meant it. The next guy who tries this will be on Keter-class duty. Seriously."// - Dr. █████
