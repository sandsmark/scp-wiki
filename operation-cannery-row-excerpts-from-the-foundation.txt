> The following documents were recovered from Unusual Incident 24,122 (UI-24122), in which a filing cabinet originally located in Foundation Regional Headquarters in Gainesville, Fla. spontaneously appeared in a UIU facility in Omaha, Neb. on Aug 14, 20██. The filing cabinet contained a portion of the Foundation's Regional Print Media Archive, containing newspaper clippings, advertisements, flyers and other print media the Foundation confiscated, censored or otherwise removed from public view in North Florida. The filing cabinet and most of its contents were heavily damaged in the Unusual Incident, leaving only 558 documents at least partially readable.
