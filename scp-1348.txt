**Item #:** SCP-1348

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:**  Due to the impossibility of transport, SCP-1348-02 is contained on-site at the Site 87 Archaeological Containment Unit, 81 kilometers from El Taebah, Syria, in the Jabal al-Druze mountains. Compartmentalized containment duties are assigned to C-1348-A and C-1348-B.  Communications between Team C-1348-A and C-1348-B are restricted to Conference Room 2a, with the exception of biweekly containment review meetings between C-1348-A Director Binyamin Kahn and C-1348-B Director █████ ██████. 

C-1348-A shall be comprised of Foundation employees recommended by Class 4 site supervisory personnel, subject to disqualification for any of the following reasons: 

* Membership in a religious faith.
* Prior exposure to a registered memetic agent.
* Fluency in Amharic, Ge'ez, Aramaic, or any Southern Semitic language.
* Prior exposure to transmissions from SCP-████.

Duties of C-1348-A include providing ritual supplies necessary for performing SCP-1348-02, monitoring performances of SCP-1348-02 for compliance, selecting members for participation in C-1348-B, providing updated ritual protocols for daily performances of SCP-1348-02, monitoring members of C-1348-B during furloughs from the containment area, and executing Protocol 228-MELECHAH.  At no time shall security personnel assigned to C-1348-A be exposed to recordings or transcripts of SCP-1348-02, nor be permitted to view SCP-1348-01-D. To minimize the risk of cross-contamination between C-1348-A and C-1348-B, all regularly scheduled communications between C-1348-A and C-1348-B are to be conducted via a staff member belonging to Y-chromosomal haplotype CMH-6. 

Candidates for C-1348-B shall be selected from individuals matrilineally descended from Druze, Mandean, and Mizrahi Jewish populations.  Qualifying candidates for C-1348-B are to be tested for Y-chromosomal haplotype CMH-6. Membership in haplotype CMH-6 is strictly disqualifying. Due to the difficulty in locating suitable Foundation candidates, Class Omega civilian celebrants with appropriate genealogy may be substituted for Foundation personnel upon C-1348-A approval.  At dawn, noon, and dusk, C-1348-B are to perform SCP-1348-02 according to protocols provided by C-1348-A. 

At all times, members of C-1348-B are to behave according to the prescribed ethical and purity codes specified in documents 742-KITAB and 983-RASAHL, as well as additional protocols developed by C-1348-A. To the extent that such codes conflict by mandating the forbidden or forbidding the mandatory, members of C-1348-B may register individual ethical preferences with C-1348-A. To avoid inadvertent ingestion of ritually impure substances, members of C-1348-B are to receive parenteral nutrition only, delivered under ritual supervision by Director █████ ██████.  Due to memetic hazard, performance of SCP-1348-02 is authorized only when necessary for the containment of SCP-1348-03.

Members of C-1348-B are permitted to exit the inner containment area during scheduled furloughs. Unscheduled exit of the inner containment area by C-1348-B constitutes grounds for immediate implementation of Protocol 228-MELECHAH.

**Description:** SCP-1348 is a modified natural cave complex located 81 kilometers from El Taebah, Syria, in the Jabal al-Druze mountains. Upon initial discovery by IAEA investigators on 03/06/2006, the complex was believed to house a Syrian breeder reactor.  Subsequent Israeli attacks on the site resulted in the discovery of three unknown chambers. Per intergovernmental compact with the Israeli and Syrian governments, Foundation agents responded, containing SCP-1348-01, 02, and 03 and constructing the Site 87 Archaeological Containment Unit. Due to unanticipated (and still-unelucidated) dietary requirements, SCP-1348-01-E expired shortly after initial containment.

[[/div]]

SCP-1348-01-E is a taxonomically anomalous humanoid originally discovered performing SCP-1348-02 on-site at SCP-1348-03. On ██/██/████, three weeks after initial containment, subject entered status epilepticus and died shortly thereafter. During containment, subject produced three presently-untranslated utterances in an unknown Southern Semitic language, but made no other attempts to communicate with Foundation staff. Food, water, and bedding were declined. Subject exhibited no otherwise anomalous behavior. For autopsy results, consult Document SCP-1348-SMR-9.

SCP-1348-02 is an unknown ritual practice, originally recorded as performed by SCP-1348-01-E, which is presumed to be intended for multiple participants. Spoken portions of SCP-1348-02 are performed in an unknown Southern Semitic language. When adequately performed by individuals meeting unclear ritual criteria, SCP-1348-02 prevents full retraction of the veil surrounding SCP-1348-03, an obligatory precursor event in scenarios XK-734, XK-918, and XK-337. At present, details of the intended ritual practice underlying SCP-1348-02, ritual criteria necessary for participation in SCP-1348-02, and the causal mechanism connecting SCP-1348-02 with the retraction of the SCP-1348-03 veil are unknown. 

At present, performances of SCP-1348-02 are believed to be memetically virulent, inducing suggestibility and religious mania in 38% of genealogically-appropriate exposures. Ongoing exposure to performances of SCP-1348-02 results in ritually-themed obsessive compulsion. Note that performances of SCP-1348-02 in its present revision are incomplete, and that the memetic effects of SCP-1348-02 appear to increase as successive revisions approach the ideal state. Members of haplotype CMH-6 appear to be strictly immune to the ritual's memetic effects. While present transcripts and recordings of SCP-1348-02 are not believed to be virulent, existing containment protocols require certified Foundation linguists and anthropologists to minimize their exposure to completed revisions of SCP-1348-02. For access to further details concerning SCP-1348-02, consult Document SCP-1348-SMR-10.

SCP-1348-03 is the central chamber of the SCP-1348 cave complex. Due to high neutron flux inside the chamber, site was originally believed to be a storage site for high-grade radioactive waste or a breached reactor core. Initial investigation of the chamber by remote-controlled drone revealed an elaborate rectangular chamber, decorated in an early proto-Semitic style. Repeated motifs include rams, serpents, slaughtered bulls, wounded lions, hawks, and depictions of what appears to be a performance of SCP-1348-02. At the center of the room is a raised platform with a 9 meter radius, surrounded by cylindrical sheath constructed of a copper/beryllium alloy, referred to by celebrants as "the veil." At dawn, noon, and dusk each day, the sheath will begin to retract and neutron flux inside SCP-1348-03 will increase considerably. Adequate performance of SCP-1348-02 appears to provide limited protection against negative health effects of high neutron flux, and results in complete closure of the veil. 

Attempts to view the area lying inside the veil, except by celebrants during performances of SCP-1348-02, have been markedly unsuccessful. Celebrants, including Foundation staff, are either unable or unwilling to disclose what lies inside. For certified information concerning the veiled regions and its contents, Class 4 staff may consult Document SCP-1348-SMR-11.

> **DOCUMENT SCP-1348-SMR-9: POSTMORTEM SUMMARY, SCP-1348-01-D**
> 
> **SUBJECT:** SCP-1348-01-E
> 
> **EXTERNAL EXAMINATION:** Body is of a taxonomically anomalous humanoid with premortem history of severe injury. Of the ten external limbs originally present, three -- both legs, one wing -- show signs of amputation by avulsion below the second joint.  Head is presumed to have been generally humanoid prior to injury, with the exception of a bilaterally symmetric third orbit located 1.2cm above the the frontal prominence. Eyes missing, presumed due to injury: optic canal is present in two grossly normal orbits. Analogous structure present in anomalous frontal orbit. Crushing injuries to frontal sinuses preclude reconstruction of original contours of facial bones. No external genitalia are visible. Injuries show signs of abnormal keloid formation, indicating  complete healing process. External injuries nonfatal. 
> 
> **INTERNAL EXAMINATION:** Structures equivalent to liver, lungs, heart, and brain are present. Kidneys are absent. Gross anatomical revealed a simple blind gut terminating in a rudimentary caecum. Urinary tract and anus absent. As no stomach or caecum contents were apparent at the time of autopsy, gut is presumed vestigial. Majority of lower abdominal cavity occupied by a segmented organ or tumor of unclear function and histology. On histologic examination, muscle and organ tissue displayed signs of catabolism and macrophage infiltration consistent with severe malnutrition. 
> 
> **CAUSE OF DEATH:** Malnutrition.
> 
> **ADDENDUM ATP-9:** For complete histologic and gross anatomical data, consult Document SCP-1348-ATP-9, FULL AUTOPSY, SCP-1348-01-D.

> <Begin recording, 9:13 AM, ██/██/████>
>  
> **Dr. Kahn**: This is the biweekly containment meeting, cycle 3, ritual revision 8. It is now 9:13 AM. Present at this meeting are Dr. Binyamin Kahn, head of Team A, and Dr.  █████ ██████, head of Team B. Ready to begin?
> **Dr.** ██████: [Inaudible].
> **Dr. Kahn**:  You'll have to speak up,  █████. I don't think the microphone caught that. First on the agenda: revisions to the containment protocol. Just to catch everyone up, we received O5 approval last week to pass the veil and conduct the hypothetical interior portions of the ritual. We're obviously not quite there on the containment procedures -- some of Team B is suffering from radiation poisoning, including Dr. ██████. We don't expect fatalities.
> **Dr.** ██████: We've got two Omegas who botched the ritual. We're going to need to rotate them off. Do we have agents to replace them? As you know, Ben, I'm uncomfortable with the idea of doing this with Omegas, and not just because they're hard to train.
> **Dr. Kahn**:  Not yet. We've got some feelers out with Herev -- I think we should be able to move in some new agents as soon as ███. 
> **Dr.** ██████: I'm going to ask you to prioritize that. 
> **Dr. Kahn**:  Next order of business: we're going to need a report on what's inside the veil. As you know, we can't get instrumentation in there, so -- 
> **Dr.** ██████: That's not happening. Put it in KITAB: we can't tell you what's beyond the veil.
> **Dr. Kahn**:  I told you, █████: that's unacceptable. Direct from O5. We've got to have some sort of read on exactly what it is we're containing in there. Is this a ritual protocol?
> **Dr.** ██████: It's... no. No, it's not. Ben, just trust me. Put it in KITAB. 
> **Dr. Kahn**:  Moshe, we're going off the record for a minute. Be a mensch and turn the tape off.
> 
> **Request denied. Per O5-07, monitoring of SCP-1348 containment review meetings is mandatory.**
> 
> **Dr. Kahn**: We need to know. Direct from O5-07: they're threatening to shut you down. How are we supposed to protect civilians from what's in there if we don't know what it is?
> **Dr.** ██████: It's not dangerous.
> **Dr. Kahn**: Look at yourself,  █████. You're covered in sores. Your teeth are falling out. How do you tell me that it's not dangerous?
> **Dr.** ██████: It's not dangerous //intentionally//. And we're not protecting the world from [h]im. We're protecting [h]im from the world. 
> **Dr. Kahn**: You're being affected,  █████. Think about it. You were out here -- with me. We worked together. You saw what I saw. How can you still believe, with all that we both know?
> **Dr.** ██████: I used to think that there was some mistake. Then I passed the veil. Now I know it's all for the best.
> **Dr. Kahn**: Listen to what you're saying. Just listen. It's all for the best?
> **Dr.** ██████: Do you know what it means for me to say that to you, Binyamin? That it is all for the best? That this is the best of all possible worlds? That //this// is? //All// this?
> **Dr. Kahn**: Please. Please don't be hysterical. You  just need to tell us what you saw. You know what it would mean if O5 shut down Team B.  What it would mean for you.  
> **Dr. Kahn**: Just tell us. 
> **Dr.** ██████: You don't understand. When you first came in here, you asked me: why do you think these people gave up on their faith? I know now. It's because [h]e thought it best that we not know the truth.    And it's true. It's true. It's best that no one know. It's best that you not know. But we owe [h]im so much. 
> **Dr. Kahn**: Please. At least think about it. I can tell O5 you've got radiation poisoning, and that you're working on the report. 
> **Dr. Kahn**: I can't hold them off forever.

> **Background:** On December 5, 2011, ████ ██████, the director of C-1348-B was found unresponsive in his quarters, suffering from severe radiation poisoning. After O5 authorization, C-1348-A instructed an Omega-class celebrant to deviate from ritual protocols and enter the central region of SCP-1348-03. After emerging from the central region, subject was unresponsive. The interview appended below occurred during a brief period of lucidity three days after initial exposure.
> 
> **Dr. Kahn**: Good morning, O-9142. The doctors tell me that you've been up and around. Do you know who I am?
> **O-9142**: You are Doctor Kahn. Ben Kahn. You live in the cave outside the door.
> **Dr. Kahn**: That's right. I have a few questions. Can you answer a few questions for me?
> **O-9142**: Yes. They told me I should trust you. 
> **Dr. Kahn**: Let's start with the ritual. Do you remember what you did?
> **O-9142**: Yes. They told me I should stand with my back to the center. That I should say the words. And when the words were over and I had said all of them, I shouldn't look, no matter what I heard.
> **Dr. Kahn**: And what did you do?
> **O-9142**: I looked. Like you told me. 
> **Dr. Kahn**: And what did you see?
> **O-9142**:  He is very old. He is hurting very badly. He is underwater, in space, and everywhere. He cannot get off his chair. He is stuck there forever because he is so badly hurt.
> **Dr. Kahn**: I'm sorry, O-9142. I don't understand. What did you see in there?
> **O-9142**: I can't remember very well anymore, because of the accident. But I remember one time I saw this old lion on television. On a nature special. He was badly hurt. The other lions ate him. I think the lion from the television is in there.  I think that lion is your uncle.
> **Dr. Kahn**: You've got to think hard, O-9142. Can you tell me how it got hurt?
> **O-9142**: I don't know. I think we did something bad. The song is about how bad we are. No, that's wrong. We didn't do anything bad. We weren't supposed to happen. We happened. It wasn't our fault that we happened. 
> **Dr. Kahn**: I'm having a hard time understanding.
> **O-9142**: Okay. Okay. The song goes like this: "iné esal peseh, ma Yehom alhallom." It means he did something wrong. What he did saved us. Now [h]e has to be punished. Now [h]e has to stay behind the veil.
> **Dr. Kahn**: What was he doing when you saw him?
> **O-9142**:  He was looking out. I saw that he saw us. We saw him. Others saw him. They weren't in the circle with us. They were standing outside the circle. Then we had to sing about how much he hurts because of us. To make the veil close. So the others don't see him back. They are very angry. They don't remember things for very long.  Less well than me, I guess. 
> **Dr. Kahn**: Is [h]e dangerous?
> **O-9142**: Dr. Ben, I'm very tired. Can I go back to sleep? 
> **Dr. Kahn**: You've almost done your job. I just need some more information.
> **O-9142**: He says he wants you to come home. He misses you. But I think he's talking about your father, not you. So you don't have to, if you don't want to.
> **Dr. Kahn**: I think we're done. You can sleep now.
> **Dr. Kahn**: Anna? You can turn up his morphine drip. Let him have as much as he wants.

> **Background**: On ██/██/████, three days after his interview with O-9142 and five days after the death of Director ██████, Site Director Kahn compiled a new instance of SCP-1348-02 and entered the inner containment area. After performing external portions of SCP-1348-02, Dr. Kahn entered the central region of SCP-1348-03. He has not been seen since, and the veil has failed to retract. Per O5-07, C-1348-B containment procedures are suspended; upon retraction of the veil, C-1348-A is to immediately execute Protocol 228-MELECHAH.
