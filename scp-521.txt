**Item #:** SCP-521

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-521 is currently contained at Site-██. The battery level of the GPS beacon attached to SCP-521 should be checked daily, with a new module being fitted in case of battery levels failing. The steel plate covering the letter slot of SCP-521 is to remain in place outside of authorized testing, and any personnel attempting to remove it are to be removed from the containment chamber and submitted for a full psychological evaluation.

MTF Pi-1 is to be held on standby for deployment during all testing of SCP-521, in order to relocate and contain the SCP before civilian deaths occur. In case of GPS failure before containment, suicide rates are to be monitored to indicate possible new locations of SCP-521.

SCP-521-1 through -14 are to be held in Archive 4 of Site-██, with access granted to any Researcher of Level 2 or higher.

Any personnel who interact with SCP-521-A are to attempt to ascertain further details as to how SCP-521 operates.

**Description:** SCP-521 is a red postbox, of a design commonly used in the United Kingdom by █████ ████. Original retrieval occurred in ████████████, England, after local suicide rates rose substantially with no causative reason. SCP-521 is for all intents and purposes a standard postbox, with chemical tests confirming no physical differences.

When SCP-521 is used for contact between a subject and a company or similar (ie: letter is not addressed to a direct person or is addressed to a representative of a company), there is no causative effect from SCP-521, and the correspondence will arrive normally. However, any direct mail from one individual to another will never arrive. Items such as these are hereafter referred to as "letter(s)". All letters received in this fashion are to be recorded as SCP-521-X, where X denotes the order of retrieval by the Foundation.

Between the time of posting and delivery, the subject who posted the letter will commit apparent suicide. Suicide methods are varied (recorded deaths vary from overdose of medication to exsanguination or self-immolation); however, the presence [REDACTED] at crime scenes suggests a third party may be involved in the deaths. 

Up to 48 hours later from the time of posting, the original envelope that contained the letter will arrive at its destination. The postmark on the envelope is not that of the █████ ████ company, but one similar to [REDACTED]. However, the original letter posted will not be found inside, having being replaced by a copy of the death certificate of the poster. This death certificate is a standard copy, the only noticeable difference being exact time of death will be recorded to within the minute, even if the death has not yet been discovered and an original death certificate created. Letters are not delivered with the regular mail of a recipient, instead being hand-delivered by a man in a grey suit, designated as SCP-521-A.

SCP-521-A is described as between 1.6 and 1.8 meters in height, approximately 50 to 60 years in age, and consistently seen wearing a grey suit with matching bowler hat. Possible links to SCP-███ are currently being investigated. All interviewed subjects say they are unable to remember any facial or distinguishing features of the figure, other than that when they have answered the door, he is very cordial when delivering the letter, and has held several lengthy conversations about topics such as the weather or recent events with recipients. However, SCP-521-A will only give the letter to the person it is directly addressed to, requesting to speak with only them if another person answers the door. SCP-521-A has been noted to arrive at wherever the recipient is at midday of the delivery date, whether this is in a workplace or home, without having any prior contact with the recipient. The address on the letter will be altered to reflect the change in location, although no evidence of alteration is present.

No after effects on the recipients have yet been observed, and all deceased have not shown any abnormalities.

Once a letter has been posted and delivered, SCP-521 will disappear from its current position, and reappear elsewhere inside its current urban location. If SCP-521 is not located inside a city at the time, it will move to the nearest city. Its current method of movement is unknown; however, the metal plate covering the letter slot will be removed. As the GPS beacons attached to the side of SCP-521 are unaffected, it is currently theorised that the main active component of SCP-521 is the letter slot itself. Any items posted after the letter that activates the effect of SCP-521 and before it moves location will be delivered normally. However, after SCP-521 has completed a transition to another area, its effect will activate on the next suitable piece of mail.

**Addendum:** Agents noted on retrieval of SCP-521 after experimentation on ██/██/████ that they were questioned by members of the general public as to why they were removing a postbox "that had always been there". However, as SCP-521 had moved at approximately ██:██ the previous day, Agents recovered a single civilian for further questioning. Investigation into slight memetic effect is ongoing. Interview log SCP-521-Eta attached below.


> **Interview SCP-521-Eta**
> **Interviewer: Dr. A████ (hereafter referred to as "Dr. A"), Interviewee: P███ H█████ (hereafter referred to as "PH")**
> **██:██, ██/██/████**
> 
> Dr. A: Can you tell me more about the postbox on the end of your street?
> PH: Why do you want to know that?
> Dr. A: Please, just answer the question.
> PH: It's just a normal postbox, it's always been there. What's so special about it I've been dragged to this lab?
> Dr. A: When can you last remember seeing the postbox in that location?
> PH: Well, the first time I noticed it was when you guys were removing it or something, but I figured as it's always been there, it was just being replaced.
> Dr. A: Tell me, had that postbox always been there since week beginning [REDACTED]?
> PH: Well yeah, it's always been there.
> Dr. A: Allow me to rephrase the question, had you seen it before [REDACTED]?
> PH: Well, I can't remember seeing it, but it's always been there, I could have just missed it.
> Dr. A: I'll be blunt P███, if you hadn't seen it before [REDACTED], how do you know it's always been in that position?
> PH: Well, of course, it's...surely...
> //Interviewee becomes visibly distressed, and refuses to answer any further questions. Class B amnesiac delivered and P███ H█████ returned to general populace.//
> //It would appear SCP-521 is able to convince anyone viewing it that it has always occupied that position. This warrants investigation into low-level memetic threats - Dr. A████//
