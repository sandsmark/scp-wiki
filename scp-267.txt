**Item #:** SCP-267

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-267 is contained in a cave formation within Site-37. Members of the colony require live animals to replace any thralls that succumb during the course of feeding. A population of appropriate livestock is maintained on site for this purpose. Level 4 containment equipment must be worn in the containment area, and any personnel interacting directly with SCP-267 organisms should be furnished with a tranquilizer weapon and cattle prod for protection.

SCP-267 organisms may not leave the area alive under any circumstances. Unauthorized individuals attempting to breach containment should likewise be neutralized.

**Description:** SCP-267 is a colony organism made up of approximately 13,000 individuals thriving in the ███████████ cave formations in █████████, █████████. Members of the colony are hairless carnivorous mammals, 60-70 cm long, which leave the colony only to forage for food. Their bite is venomous, and injects an aggressively carcinogenic compound along with a paralytic as a hunting and defense mechanism. SCP-267 prefers to consume tumorous flesh, which it cultivates in subterranean "gardens" populated by creatures captured and imprisoned from the surface.

Unlike arthropod colony organisms, there is no queen in an SCP-267 colony. There are caste divisions in its population, however, including workers, soldiers, breeders, and nursery attendants. Only the workers are routinely encountered on the surface. Dozens of workers cooperate in hunts, communicating by chemical means to locate and attack prey. The hunters attack simultaneously, inflicting hundreds of bites in a few seconds and incapacitating the target. They then drag it, conscious but immobile, back to their colony.

At the colony, swarms of SCP-267 emerge to transport the victim to a garden. Workers remove foreign aromas, carefully check new larder animal for parasites, and physically dismantle the organism's means of locomotion to prevent escape. By this time, tissues directly exposed to venom have begun to exhibit abnormal cell division. Within 24 hours, undifferentiated masses of tissue are visible at every bite location. Tumors arise spontaneously but seem to prefer skin and fatty tissues, as growths there are unlikely to threaten vital organ systems. This has the added benefit to SCP-267 of producing tumors with a high concentration of lipids for consumption. The tumors grow continuously until a few days after the larder animal's death.

Because of the rapid tumorigenesis, larders have massive caloric needs. Workers masticate and regurgitate root pulp to provide the larders with nutrition. They seem to be able to distinguish cancerous from healthy tissue by its aroma, and remove tumors once they have "ripened" to a desirable size. Workers have been observed licking larder animals to keep them clean and healthy.

SCP-267 is violently territorial and responds with overwhelming force to any intrusion into their caves. With sufficient food they are also capable of rapid reproduction, a fact that has become particularly disturbing since the extinction of their primary predator, //Thylacinus cynocephalus//.

**Addendum 267-1:** Bones from human beings have been uncovered in multiple waste areas within the caves, dating back several thousand years. Because of the difficulties in operating inside the nest, a full forensic survey of these leavings is unfeasible. ████ months after containment was first established, larder A-26 was discovered to be human, possibly █████████████, who disappeared along with his parents on a camping trip in 19██ at the age of █. The lack of appendages combined with rampant tumor growth is responsible for complicating the initial identification. Genetic tests are consistent with human DNA with massive deleterious mutations. Attempted interviews with the subject (SCP-267-██) have discovered only that his language faculties appear to have atrophied over the course of his imprisonment.

**Addendum 267-2:** It has been established that SCP-267 shows a positive preference for acquiring human larders as compared to other mammals. This is likely a result of humans' long life span and fast metabolism compared to other options. Human subjects provide ██% more cancerous matter per month to the colony than a similarly sized pig, and can last in excess of ██ years before expiring. This explains archaeological evidence of human predation even at a time before habitat intrusion made such behavior inevitable.
