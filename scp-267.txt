**Item #:** SCP-267

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-267 is contained in a cave formation within Site-37. Members of the colony require live animals to replace any that succumb during the course of feeding. A population of appropriate livestock is maintained on site for this purpose. Level 4 containment equipment must be worn in the containment area, and any personnel interacting directly with SCP-267 organisms should be furnished with a tranquilizer weapon and cattle prod for protection. 

SCP-267 organisms may not leave the area alive under any circumstances. Unauthorized individuals attempting to breach containment should likewise be neutralized. SCP-267 venom, and any tissue samples or live subjects affected by it, is classified a level 4 biohazard. █████████████████ exposed to the venom are terminated at the conclusion of experimentation.

**Description:** SCP-267 is a eusocial organism made up of thousands of individuals living in an underground nest. A single colony is currently contained by the foundation for study in the ███████████ cave formations in █████████, █████████. Individuals are hairless, sightless, carnivorous rodents highly adapted for subterranean group living and cooperative hunting. They appear to have diverged evolutionarily from //Heterocephalus glaber// within the last 2 million years. Because of their unique feeding behavior, a nest of SCP-267 can go unnoticed for some time, often claiming numerous human victims before its discovery (see incident 267-F).

In addition to the lack of eyes, auditory and tactile senses are extremely atrophied. Individuals do not seem to experience pain or have any sense of self-preservation. They are, however, extremely sensitive to smell and airborne chemical stimuli, which they use for navigation, hunting, and communication. Unlike in eusocial arthropods, there is no queen in an SCP-267 colony. There are caste divisions in its population, however, including workers, soldiers, breeders, and nursery attendants.

When hunting or defending their colony, SCP-267 employ a toxic bite. This venom is effective in µL amounts and has aggressive carcinogenic and paralytic effects. The paralytic allows affected victims to be captured, while the carcinogen is integral to SCP-267's method of feeding. SCP-267 consumes tumorous flesh, which it cultivates in subterranean "gardens" populated by hundreds of captured organisms maintained for that purpose. Because food production occurs in the colony, SCP-267 only leaves the nest to hunt. Captured larder animals typically last between 3 months and ██ years, depending on the organism, so many months typically elapse between forays to the surface.

Dozens of workers cooperate in hunts, communicating by chemical means to locate and attack prey. The hunters attack simultaneously, inflicting hundreds of bites in a few seconds and incapacitating the target. They then drag it, conscious but immobile, back to their colony.

At the colony, swarms of SCP-267 emerge to transport the victim to a garden. Workers remove foreign aromas, carefully check for parasites, and physically dismantle the organism's means of locomotion to prevent escape. By this time, tissues directly exposed to venom have begun to exhibit abnormal cell division. Within 24 hours, undifferentiated masses of tissue are visible at every bite location. Tumors arise spontaneously but seem to target skin and fatty tissues, as growths there are unlikely to threaten vital organ systems. This has the added benefit to SCP-267 of producing tumors with a high concentration of lipids for consumption. The tumors grow continuously until a few days after the larder animal's death.

Because of the rapid tumorigenesis, larders have massive caloric needs. Workers masticate and regurgitate root pulp to provide the larders with nutrition. They seem to be able to distinguish cancerous from healthy tissue by its scent, and remove tumors once they have "ripened" to a desirable size. Workers have been observed licking larder animals to keep them clean and healthy.

SCP-267 is violently territorial and responds with overwhelming force to any intrusion into their caves. With sufficient food they are also capable of extremely rapid reproduction, a fact that has become particularly disturbing since the extinction of their primary predator, ███████████████████.

**Addendum 267-1:** Bones from human beings have been uncovered in multiple waste areas within the caves, dating back several thousand years. Because of the difficulties in operating inside the nest, a full forensic survey of these leavings is unfeasible. ████ months after containment was first established, larder A-26 was discovered to be human, possibly █████████████, who disappeared along with his parents on a camping trip in 19██ at the age of █. The lack of appendages combined with rampant tumor growth is responsible for complicating the initial identification. Genetic tests are consistent with human DNA with massive deleterious mutations. Attempted interviews with the subject (SCP-267-██) have discovered only that his language faculties have atrophied over the course of his imprisonment.

**Addendum 267-2:** It has been established that SCP-267 shows a positive preference for acquiring humans as compared to other mammals. This is likely a result of humans' long life span and fast metabolism compared to other options. Human subjects provide ██% more cancerous matter per month than a similarly sized pig, and can last in excess of ██ years before expiring. This explains archaeological evidence of human predation even at a time before habitat intrusion made such behavior inevitable.

**Incident 267-F:** A colony of SCP-267 was found and exterminated in █████████████, ███ after claiming an estimated 9 human victims. The nest had apparently been established in the local bedrock, and had recently tunneled into the town sewers and begun preying on vagrants. Its presence was discovered after 3 members of the █████████████ sanitation department went missing. This is the first incidence of SCP-267 so far north, which implies an expansion of SCP-267's geographical range. Detection and containment procedures have been modified accordingly.
