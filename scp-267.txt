**Item #:** SCP-267

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-267 is contained in a geological cave formation within Site-37. Members of the colony require live animals to replace any thralls that succumb during the course of feeding. A population of appropriate livestock is maintained on site for this purpose. Level 4 containment equipment must be worn in the containment area, and any personnel interacting directly with SCP-267 organisms should be furnished with a tranquilizer weapon and cattle prod for protection.

SCP-267 organisms may not leave the area alive under any circumstances. Unauthorized individuals attempting to breach containment should likewise be neutralized.

**Description:** SCP-267 is a colony organism made up of approximately 13,000 individuals which live in subterranean caverns. Members of the colony are hairless carnivorous mammals, 60-70 cm long, which leave the colony only to forage for food. Their primary weapon is their venomous bite, which exposes victims to an aggressive carcinogen with additional paralytic effects. They feed by poisoning and capturing larger animals and feeding on the cancerous growths their venom provokes.

Unlike arthropod colony organisms, there is no queen in an SCP-267 colony. There are caste divisions in its population, however, including workers, soldiers, breeders, and nursery attendants. Only the workers are routinely encountered on the surface. Dozens of workers cooperate in hunts, communicating by chemical means to locate and attack prey. The hunters attack simultaneously, inflicting hundreds of bites in a few seconds and incapacitating the target. They then drag it, conscious but immobile, back to their colony.

After 6 hours, tissues directly exposed to the venom begin to show signs of abnormal cell division. Within 24 hours undifferentiated masses of tissue are visible at every bite location, and will continue to grow constantly. SCP-267 workers dismantle the prisoners' means of locomotion at this point, converting them into "thralls". Workers prolong the thralls' lives for as long as possible while "trimming" tumors regularly to provide food for the colony. They constantly masticate and regurgitate root matter from the walls to feed the thralls, and clean them of parasites regularly.

SCP-267 is violently territorial and responds with overwhelming force to any intrusion into their caves. With sufficient food they are also capable of rapid reproduction, a fact that has become particularly disturbing since the extinction of their primary predator, //Thylacinus cynocephalus//.

**Addendum 267-1:** Bones from human individuals have been uncovered in multiple waste areas within the caves, dating back several thousand years. Because of the difficulties in operating under such conditions, a full forensic survey of these leavings is unfeasible. Shortly after containment was first established, thrall A-26 was discovered to be human, possibly █████████████, who disappeared along with his parents on a camping trip in 19██ at the age of █. Genetic tests of the thrall are consistent with human DNA with massive deleterious mutations.
