> 
> **SCP-1250-2 tape (3):** Dr. T████ is heard attempting to say the greeting. He sounds very weak, and takes several labored breaths after every few words. He does not finish the greeting before the recording ends.
> 
> **SCP-1250-2 tape (4):** Two separate voices say the greeting. They are very stoic, and they speak in perfect unison. Neither voice can be identified as that of Dr. T████.
>

> 
> **SCP-1250-2 tape (6):** A crowd of people can be heard murmuring in the room. All of the voices appear to be uttering the greeting, though it is impossible to tell if Dr. T████ is among them.

> **Duration:** 00:08:04   
> 
> Dr. ███████ interviews Mr. █████. Several times during the interview, Dr. ███████ will randomly hold up a card with a simple drawing on it, and ask Mr. █████ to describe what he sees. A total of 7 cards were held up during the course of the interview. It's important to note that aside from the card results, both interviews were the same.
> 
> **Control tape:** Mr. █████'s responses to the image cards: cat, airplane, flower, barn, teddy bear, horse, apple.
> 
> **SCP-1250-2 tape:** Mr. █████'s responses to the image cards: pencil, window, swan, tree, airplane, bus, moon. All responses given were for cards that did exist in the deck.

> 
> Dr. ████ was asked to play Moonlight Sonata on an old grand piano. He has very little experience playing the instrument.
> 
> **Control tape:** Dr. ████ hits several bum notes, and re-attempts several sections of the song to correct mistakes. He politely asks to stop playing after attempting for over 10 minutes, and the recording is ceased by Dr. Edwards.
> 
> **SCP-1250-2 tape (1):** Dr. ████ handles the instrument flawlessly, playing with considerable grace, and receives a roaring applause from the other researchers present. In the place of Moonlight Sonata, the song played by Dr. ████ is unknown.
> 
> **SCP-1250-2 tape (2):** A single note is played in 2 second intervals until 00:09:09. No other sounds can be heard for the remainder of the recording.

> 
> **Control tape:** Dr. Carter asks the aforementioned questions.
> 
> **SCP-1250-2 tape (1):** Dr. Carter can be heard talking, though he is very muffled, almost as if he were speaking from the other side of a wall. The nature of his speech is entirely indecipherable.
> 
> **SCP-1250-2 tape (2):** A loud, atonal screeching eminates from the tape for the entire duration of the recording.

> **Name:** Dr. T████
> **Date:** ██/██/2009
> **Duration:** 00:45:03
> 
> Three tapes were left to record an empty room for 45 minutes.
> 
> **Control tape:** Dr. T████ is heard exiting the room as the recording begins. Apart from a nearby door being closed at 00:27:01, the recording is entirely silent until Dr. T████'s return at 00:44:51 to end the recording.
> 
> **SCP-1250-2 tape (1):** Dr. T████ is heard exiting the room as the recording begins. Infrequently, a light shuffling can be heard to the direct left. At 00:05:02 heavy, deliberate footsteps are slowly heard approaching from the left and continuing on past the empty room to the right. They can no longer be heard at 00:24:44, and the shuffling ceases at this point. Dr. T████ reenters the room at 00:45:16 to end the recording.
> 
> **SCP-1250-2 tape (2):** Dr. T████ is heard exiting the room as the recording begins. At 00:13:08 a loud crash is heard coming from the right. Another loud crash occurs at 00:16:02, and an even louder one at 00:19:17. Something begins pounding on the wall in the hall outside the empty room at 00:26:20 and continues to do so with a consistent intensity. The door to the empty room is heard being torn from the frame at 00:44:10 as an unseen force proceeds to thrash it around the room. The tape cuts off at 00:45:03.

**Note:** Please be sure to include your name, the date, and duration of the recording on all records. Due to the omission of audio by SCP-1250-2 video samples, all descriptions provided should cover only what is seen during the control tapes, not what is heard.

> **Name:** Agent H████, with Dr. Carter & Dr. T████ monitoring.
> **Date:** ██/██/200█
> **Duration:** 00:00:23
> 
> Agent H████ was asked to fire 3 shots at  Personnel D-32907 using his Colt 45, from a distance of 22.5 meters. The Agent was also asked to intentionally try and avoid hitting D-329071 during the experiment, though this information was not shared with D-329071.
> 
> **Control tape:** The first two shots miss the subject. The 3rd strikes him directly in the right shoulder, the subject clutching at the wound and reeling in pain before the recording ends.
> 
> **SCP-1250-2 tape (1):** All 3 shots miss the subject without incident.
> 
> **SCP-1250-2 tape (2):** All 3 shots contact with the subject's chest and abdomen, knocking them to the floor.
> 
> **SCP-1250-2 tape (3):** Agent H████ is seen standing directly behind D-32907, with his firearm pressed against the backside of the subject's head. He fires a single shot, killing the subject instantly, and stares at the camera for the remainder of the recording.

> **Name:** Dr. T████
> **Date:** ██/██/200█
> **Duration:** 09:14:36  
> 
> Two cameras were left overnight in front of a television blaring static.
> 
> **Control tape:** The static is consistently seen for the duration of the tape.
> 
> **SCP-1250-2 tape (1):** In place of the static, stock footage of spiders is seen. The majority of the footage focuses on the spiders capturing and eating prey.
> 
> **SCP-1250-2 tape (2):** In place of the static, black and white footage of a deceased elderly man is seen. He sits slumped in a chair next to an ornate lamp, in a room devoid of any other furniture. At 00:05:06 his body begins falling to pieces, starting from the top down. This process is subtle at first, as it takes up until 09:12:00 to fully complete and is more easily observed when the footage is sped up.
> 
> **SCP-1250-2 tape (3):** The television is off, and a lamp behind the camera can be seen in the television's reflection. A silhouetted figure is seen passing through the reflection on occasion.

> **Name:** Dr. T████ with [REDACTED]
> **Date:** ██/██/20██
> **Duration:** 01:12:01  
> 
> 24 hours prior to this experiment, Dr. T████ was the victim of an unfortunate car crash, and was rushed to ████ ██████ Hospital, under Foundation custody. Dr. T████ had previously asked to have his final moments captured on tape by SCP-1250-1, in the event of a fatal injury or terminal illness.
> 
> **Control tape:** Dr. T████ remains motionless in his hospital bed for the duration of the recording. Nurses are seen rushing in at 00:43:05 in response to his heart monitor flat-lining. Despite their best efforts, Dr. T████'s heartbeat is not restored, and he is pronounced deceased at 1:09:15.
> 
> **SCP-1250-2 tape:** Dr. T████ is conscious during the initial portions of the recording, and is seen discussing something with one of the nurses before she exits the room at 00:25:54. Dr. Carter is seen walking into frame at 00:43:05, and quickly proceeds to smother his colleague with a nearby pillow. Dr. T████ struggles against the attempted suffocation, but he is easily overpowered by Carter, and falls still at 01:09:15. Dr. Carter exits the room following the confrontation, and is not seen for the remainder of the recording.
