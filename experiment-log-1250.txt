> 
> **SCP-1250-1 tape (1):** Dr. ████ handles the instrument flawlessly, playing with considerable grace, and receives a roaring applause from the other researchers present. In the place of Moonlight Sonata, the song played by Dr. ████ is unknown.
> 
> **SCP-1250-1 tape (2):** A single note is played in 2 second intervals until 00:09:09. No other sounds can be heard for the remainder of the recording.

> 
> **SCP-1250-1 tape (1):** Dr. Carter can be heard talking, though he is very muffled, almost as if he were speaking from the other side of a wall. The nature of his speech is entirely indecipherable.
> 
> **SCP-1250-1 tape (2):** A loud, atonal screeching emanates from the tape for the entire duration of the recording.

> 
> **SCP-1250-1 tape (1):** Dr. T████ is heard exiting the room as the recording begins. Infrequently, a light shuffling can be heard to the direct left. At 00:05:02 heavy, deliberate footsteps are slowly heard approaching from the left and continuing on past the empty room to the right. They can no longer be heard at 00:24:44, and the shuffling ceases at this point. Dr. T████ reenters the room at 00:45:16 to end the recording.
> 
> **SCP-1250-1 tape (2):** Dr. T████ is heard exiting the room as the recording begins. At 00:13:08 a loud crash is heard coming from the right. Another loud crash occurs at 00:16:02, and an even louder one at 00:19:17. Something begins pounding on the wall in the hall outside the empty room at 00:26:20 and continues to do so with a consistent intensity. The door to the empty room is heard being torn from the frame at 00:44:10 as something proceeds to thrash it around the room. The tape cuts off at 00:45:03.

> 
> **SCP-1250-2 tape (2):** In place of the static, black and white footage of a deceased elderly man is seen. He sits slumped in a chair next to an ornate lamp, in a room devoid of any other furniture. At 00:05:06 his body begins falling to pieces, starting from the top down. This process is subtle at first, as it takes up until 09:12:00 to fully complete and is more easily observed when the footage is sped up.
> 
> **SCP-1250-2 tape (3):** The television is off, and a lamp behind the camera can be seen in the television's reflection. A silhouetted figure is seen passing through the reflection on occasion.

> 
> **SCP-1250-2 tape (3):** Identical to control, except that the position and orientation of the shadows of objects shown in the recording suggests the presence of more than one sun-like source of illumination.
> 
> **SCP-1250-2 tape (4):** Rules of game appear to have changed - pitcher and fielding team seem to be throwing the ball at the batter's head with intent to injure, following which the batter chases the pitcher around the field, attempting to beat him with the bat.  Umpire, coaches and spectators appear to regard this behavior as normal.
> 
> **SCP-1250-2 tape (5):** Identical to control, except that game participants and spectators appear to be reciting a prayer to Dažbog (Slavic pagan sun god) in the Old Church Slavonic language while playing.

> **Name:** Dr. T████ with [REDACTED]
> **Date:** ██/██/2010
> **Duration:** 01:12:01
> 
> 24 hours prior to this experiment, Dr. T████ was the victim of an unfortunate car crash, and was rushed to ████ ██████ Hospital, under Foundation custody. Dr. T████ had previously asked to have his final moments captured on tape by SCP-1250-2, in the event of a fatal injury or terminal illness.
> 
> **Control tape:** Dr. T████ remains motionless in his hospital bed for the duration of the recording. Nurses are seen rushing in at 00:43:05 in response to his heart monitor flat-lining. Despite their best efforts, Dr. T████'s heartbeat is not restored, and he is pronounced deceased at 1:09:15.
> 
> **SCP-1250-2 tape:** Dr. T████ is conscious during the initial portions of the recording, and is seen discussing something with one of the nurses before she exits the room at 00:25:54. Dr. Carter is seen walking into frame at 00:43:05, and quickly proceeds to smother his colleague with a nearby pillow. Dr. T████ struggles against the attempted suffocation, but he is easily overpowered by Carter, and falls still at 01:09:15. Dr. Carter exits the room following the confrontation, and is not seen for the remainder of the recording.
> 
> //Following the events of the above experiment, the project has been handed over to Dr. Carter. He has requested that no further SCP-1250-2 experimentation be performed for the time being.//
