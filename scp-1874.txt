**Item #:** SCP-XXXX

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-XXXX is to be contained in a paddock at the Agricultural Research Station at Site 58, as part of a flock of no less than seven (7) sheep kept within the Experimental Farm. SCP-XXXX is to wear a sheep jacket at all times in order to facilitate distinguishing it from the rest of the flock; the sheep jacket is to be replaced immediately whenever necessary. Due to the highly social nature of the species, SCP-XXXX will suffer the physiological effects of extreme stress if isolated from other sheep for more than 1 day; in the event that any of the other sheep are killed, they are to be replaced within that time frame. All interactions with SCP-XXXX and its flock, including veterinary care, must be done with full protective gear (gloves, long sleeves, goggles, boots).[[footnote]]//The required protective gear is to be worn **at all times** in the vicinity of SCP-XXXX. I don't know why I should even have to reiterate this fact, but we're still cleaning up what's left of D-1357 after he disobeyed this protocol.// - Dr. Waverton [[/footnote]] SCP-XXXX and its flock are all to have standard access to water and foraging-suitable vegetation.

**Description:** SCP-XXXX is a female sheep (//Ovis aries//), of an as-yet-unidentified breed. When SCP-XXXX makes contact with the skin of a live mammal that is not another sheep, SCP-XXXX will explode. The force of this explosion has yet to be properly measured; however, when in an open space, it is sufficient to kill everything within approximately six (6) meters of SCP-XXXX. SCP-XXXX is not immune to its own explosive nature, and will be reduced to biological debris; however, after approximately 5 minutes, the flesh and organs will move towards each other, and reassemble into SCP-XXXX as it was immediately prior to the explosion. The process of reassembly and reanimation takes 1 minute. SCP-XXXX does not appear to be traumatized or otherwise psychologically affected by its detonations.

Breeding experiments with SCP-XXXX have been unsuccessful; in particular work, male sheep have proven to be extremely reluctant to mate with SCP-XXXX after witnessing its detonation. However, if it is possible for SCP-XXXX to bear lambs that share its anomaly, it would open opportunities to do internal experimentation on SCP-XXXX.

**Acquisition Log:** SCP-XXXX was discovered on ██/██/20██, in the aftermath of an apparent terrorist attack at the ███████, ████████ Petting Zoo, in which ██ visitors and █ employees were killed; all other sheep in the paddock likewise died in the blast, with the exception of SCP-XXXX, which was standing at the blast's epicenter and grazing on vegetation. Amnestics were administered to survivors and witnesses, and SCP-XXXX was taken into custody.
