**Schedule:** Weekly (Friday), with occasional extra content.

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to SCP Café treating SCP documents as works of fiction, no containment procedures are necessary at the moment. Instead, Foundation webcrawlers are to focus on monitoring publications for unusual behavior.

**Description:** SCP Café installments typically cover newly cataloged SCP objects. The means by which the show's host has obtained access to the SCP database remains unknown. The host, [[*user pxdnbluesoul]], typically recaps articles and provides literary analysis as well as his thoughts on individual articles. 

A merchandise shop claiming to support an unknown project titled 'Project Foundation' additionally exists, and may be viewed [*https://store.scp.cafe here].
