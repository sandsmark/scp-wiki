**Item #:** SCP-808-J

**Object Class:** Ketarrrr

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-808-J is ta be kept in a locked wooden chest buried deep beneath the sands on an isle far way. Ta get ta the fortune that awaits, ya must take 20 paces east past the forked tree, then 30 paces north from the swift stream. It's buried 'neath an X in the sand. But, only the most courageous of all men dare ta disturb old Captain Blue's last treasure. Some say ta this day, his ghost still haunts the island, waitin' fer unlikely men ta try and take his precious booty. Then he snatches them up they're nary seen again.

Sailin' ta the isles that hold the lost booty is an adventure itself. Its location can only be found on a map, contained within Davy Jones' Containment Locker 808-J on Ship-19. The island is surrounded by reefs and rocks that only the most experienced seaman can navigate, else he crash and end in the deep blue. Captains are not ta bring woman aboard their ship, even ne'er seen before beauties can bring only the worst of luck. Men that learn the location of the island without permission from O5-R are ta walk the plank. Dead men tell no tales.

In order ta survive the long haul, captains are ta bring many fruits aboard ta be savin' even their scurviest of dogs.

**Description:** SCP-808-J is a treasure long lost from the knowledge of yer everyday landlubber. Only legends tell of its existence, a vast fortune hidden away by the great Site Captain Blue many years ago. It's said that he who finds the treasure may be the richest man ta sail the seven seas.
