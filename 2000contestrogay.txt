**Item #:** SCP-2000

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Containment Attempt Summary:** Initially after SCP-2000 was classified as Euclid, other, apparently failed, test materials were euthanized by the engineers of Mobile Task Force 43, "Quarter Junkies". The waste material was encased in concrete and buried near Alamagordo, New Mexico. Prior to the manifestation of the neutralizing effect, all instances of SCP-2000 were stored within Site-92. The status of SCP-2000 is currently unknown. The anomaly it propagates renders all methods of close examination with it to be non-viable. The facility which houses the anomaly was lost in 1984, along with all personnel assigned to monitor it. 

Personnel are not to listen to any possible attempts by former SCP-2000 researchers to contact them. Personnel are advised to contact their immediate supervisor should such a situation occur.


**Description:** SCP-2000 is a set of 8 Cathode Ray Tube television sets, displaying the face of a human subject. Reports of their disappearance have been suppressed by Foundation misinformation agents. Video displayed on SCP-2000 each depict a different humanoid subject. Subjects depicted do not display awareness of their surroundings, but will occasionally react to stimuli caused by testing. Faces displayed on SCP-2000 currently are:

* Three adolescent subjects, two female and one male identical to youths who were reported as missing during the year 1981. All were reported missing at or around Portland, Oregon.
* One unidentified adult subject. Video of the subject has been altered to obscure the face, leaving a white silhouette. Hair is still present.
* A male identified as █████ ████████, a former agent of the KGB who worked within the United States, reported deceased in 1991.
* Two adult human subjects, female, who constantly mouth the words "Setting sail ships us free" and "The Kit Case jumped over the lazy Bolshy".

All instances of SCP-2000 are connected to one Atari Video Computer System[[footnote]]Colloquially known as the "Atari 2600"[[/footnote]], via a 12 meter cable extending from the cartridge slot. The power supply and controller ports have been removed, and the copyright information on the bottom of the unit has been replaced with a label reading "MK-PRO-1-POL". 

Human subjects exposed to SCP-2000 will experience a mind-affecting anomaly. Subjects become very susceptible to suggestion, as long as they are within 20 meters of it. Once a subject has been exposed, stepping outside of this range will cause them to experience a state of mind similar to those found in subjects exposed to Lysergic acid diethylamide[[footnote]]Commonly referred to as "LSD".[[/footnote]]. Adjusting the switches will cause the user to be susceptible to different forms of persuasion, and display distinct emotional alterations. Tested changes have included sudden anger, aggression, confusion, sadness, apathy, and submission. This effect has been noted to last between 20 minutes to 4 hours, --after which subjects will return to their normal behaviors--.

The research, which led to the discovery of SCP-2000, initially began after an inquiry into the Unusual Incidents Unit revealed a Class-3 "Cart" had been discovered in  Salt Lake City, Utah. The effects of the object were not known at this time, as all records of its discovery were destroyed before Foundation agents could recover them. However, it is known that separately from this, in 1980, the Atari Inc. video game corporation was contracted by the US Army to create war simulation software.

The anomaly currently designated as SCP-2000 was first brought to Foundation attention through internal documentation leaks in May of 1981, from the Atari, Inc. corporation. These leaks indicated that the project had exceeded its original scope, and was almost completely being developed by the Central Intelligence Agency. One subject, ██ ████████, was noted as having dramatic behavioral changes after being recruited to the CIA. Efforts to recover SCP-2000 were redoubled at this point.

By the end of 1982, efforts to block the initial creation of the targeted anomalous objects had failed, resulting in the initial creation of SCP-2000. However, the project was apparently abandoned shortly thereafter. Foundation agents were able to recover SCP-2000 on ██/14/1982.

Financial difficulties overtook Atari at this time, leading to its dissolution, and Foundation personnel were able to confiscate all of their materials relating to SCP-2000. Personnel involved in the development of SCP-2000 remain under observation, particularly those involved with the Central Intelligence Agency and the Unusual Incidents Unit. 

As of 9/18/1984, SCP-2000 has been classified as Euclid.

**Addendum 2000-A-I:** Analysis of Site-92 has shown that, over the past 11 months since SCP-2000 was contained and classified, several unusual trends have emerged. These include:

* Above average number of volunteers for research and analysis of SCP-2000 related records and anomalous effects.
* Electric usage for the Site-92 west facilities, where SCP-2000 is stored, being abnormally high. This has been attributed to research staff leaving the lights on at all hours of the day.
* Level 3 personnel approving above-average research budgets for projects relating to SCP-2000. 
* D-Class personnel not needing instruction in regards to testing SCP-2000's anomalous effect.

As such, Site-92 personnel have been determined to have been affected by a previously unknown effect of SCP-2000. A Level-4 emergency mental purge and containment situation has been declared by O5-██, and all personnel are to be evacuated from the site within 90 hours. All SCP objects are to be transferred to the nearby Site-18, and SCP-2000 itself neutralized by Foundation staff.

**Addendum 2000-A-II:** All personnel connected to Site-92 have been presumed lost, and the Site itself reclassified as an anomalous containment area. Any subject with knowledge of the facility, or being sent in with any expectation, will immediately be compelled to turn and leave the area. Use of double blind study participants has shown that the exterior of Site-92 has been substantially reduced, to a 1/500th scale. Use of anomalous countermeasures to destroy SCP-2000 are being considered.

> The Arcadia effect, which surrounds a ███ █████████████ ██████████████ ████. The effect appears to be entirely contained to the mind, with the vast spaces apparently covered by the eyes not existing. Notably, Agents are to note that thoughts of apathy, tinnitus, and minor rashes appearing around the temples are normal. In addition, there have been reports of vivid hallucinations of "broken, sweaty skin bumping up and down on a bus, with the shredded rubbery not-rubber wheels and some boy's mother on the top". These have been found to be mildly troubling to Agents with a Psionic Resistance Index below 45.0. These Agents are not permitted to  in█████ with the object and its surrounding ██████ ██████.
