**Item #:** SCP-2587

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2587 is contained in a submerged 30 x 30 x 15 meter containment chamber at Marine Site-05. Due to SCP-2587's diet, ocean water is allowed to flow through SCP-2587's containment chamber for feeding purposes. All water that flows through SCP-2587's containment chamber is to be stored in a tank. This water is to be sampled and tested for any foreign material before it is allowed to return to the ocean. SCP-2587 is to undergo weekly ultrasound examinations, and any changes in behavior are to be reported to the current project head.

SCP-2587-A8 and SCP-2587-B are kept in standard humanoid containment chambers and are to undergo weekly psychological examinations.

**Description:** SCP-2587 is an amorphous organism with a length of 20 meters and a height of 10 meters. The object is composed of human tissue with no known pattern of distribution encased in a continuous epidermis and dermis. All attempts to penetrate the dermis have been unsuccessful, but the epidermis may be damaged through conventional means.

Undifferentiated tissue makes up approximately 80% of the object's mass and is currently believed to act as insulation or protection. The remaining 20% of SCP-2587 is taken up by the object's digestive system. This system consists of multiple esophagi connected to patches of the object's skin. These patches of skin can be moved around the object to face the current and are used to gather nutrients through filter-feeding and absorption of small animals. Notably, the amount of matter SCP-2587 ingests is not enough to sustain an organism of similar size. It is possible that this is due to the organism's simplicity, though the possibility of additional anomalous effects has not been ruled out. The esophagi lead into a central chamber that acts as the object's stomach. 15 chambers are connected to the stomach by additional esophagi. Each of these chambers holds an instance of SCP-2587-A.

SCP-2587-A refers to 16 humans. 15 SCP-2587-A instances are contained within the secondary chambers of SCP-2587, with SCP-2587-A8 having been released (See Addendum 2587-02). SCP-2587-A is comprised of ten males (SCP-2587-A1 through A10) and six females (SCP-2587-A11 through A16) of varying age. All instances are either pubescent or post-pubescent. SCP-2587-A instances are kept in stasis and fed through an umbilical cord that draws nutrients from the stomach of SCP-2587. Instances will occasionally make simple movements such as bending their limbs or clenching and unclenching their hands. As of 8/13/12, SCP-2587-A8 is the only recovered instance.

SCP-2587-B is an adult female human which is a genetic match to SCP-2587.[[footnote]]DNA samples were recovered from the Unusual Incidents Unit, who had SCP-2587-B in custody due to her involvement with UIU Casefile 2008-007.[[/footnote]] SCP-2587-B identifies as Martha Fern, who was reported missing in 2007 and was recovered shortly after by the UIU. Subject possesses multiple injuries that it claims were caused by extraterrestrial abduction. SCP-2587-B possesses a large wound on her abdomen which had been cauterized prior to capture. Subject also possesses multiple wounds on her thighs indicative of skin removal.

> **Interviewee:** SCP-2587-B
> //Foreword: Interview was conducted to acquire more detail on SCP-2587-B's claims of alien abduction. Interview has been translated from Polish.//
> ------
> **Dr. Finch:** Please state your name for the record.
> 
> **SCP-2587-B:** Martha Fern.
> 
> **Dr. Finch:** Could you describe what you experienced during your supposed abduction?
> 
> **SCP-2587-B:** Sure. Where should I start?
> 
> **Dr. Finch:** On the night that you were abducted.
> 
> **SCP-2587-B:** Okay. So I just got home, it was about eleven o'clock at night. I get ready for bed and I go to sleep just like any other evening. When I wake up, I'm lying on something hard and flat, and everything around me is dark.
> 
> **Dr. Finch:** Could you make out any details?
> 
> **SCP-2587-B:** No, it was too dark.
> 
> **Dr. Finch:** Do you remember anything?
> 
> **SCP-2587-B:** Yeah, I remember being in there for hours. It was like my c-section, but worse. I felt everything happening to me, but none of it hurt. I did feel something wet touch me several times. After a while, someone lit a blowtorch and I saw them.
> 
> **Dr. Finch:** Them?
> 
> **SCP-2587-B:** Giant blue blobs with people inside. They were the ones operating on me. They cauterized their incision, put me under, and then I woke up in the woods.
> 
> **Dr. Finch:** Are there any other details you remember?
> 
> **SCP-2587-B:** No, that's all.
> 
> **Dr. Finch:** Thank you SCP-2587. That will be all.

**Addendum 2587-02:** Incident 2587-01

During an ultrasound examination on 9/17/12, one of SCP-2587's secondary chambers began moving away from the center of SCP-2587. After three minutes of movement, a section of SCP-2587's epidermis opened up where the chamber containing SCP-2587-A8 had made contact with it. SCP-2587-A8's umbilical cord was severed, and the unconscious instance was deposited outside of SCP-2587. A diving team was sent in and the instance was recovered without incident. Post-incident examination revealed the presence of a currently-unidentified blue fluid within the water that is believed to originate from SCP-2587.

SCP-2587-A8 identifies as Adam Smith, a resident of Washington D.C. that went missing in 2008. Aside from an MARS[[footnote]]Mind-Affecting Resistance Scale[[/footnote]] score of eight out of ten, SCP-2587-A8 does not display any unusual characteristics. An interview with the subject can be found in Addendum 2587-03.

**Addendum 2587-03:** Interview with SCP-2587-A8.

> **Interview 2587-A8-02**
> **Interviewer:** Dr. Avery Finch, on-site psychologist
> **Interviewee:** SCP-2587-A8
> ------
> **Dr. Finch:** Please state your name for the record.
> 
> **SCP-2587-A8:** Adam Smith.
> 
> **Dr. Finch:** Describe your experiences leading up to your entry into SCP-2587.
> 
> **SCP-2587-A8:** So I went to bed one night. Nothing unusual, just a normal evening. I go to sleep, and I wake up in some cell wearing a hospital gown.
> 
> **Dr. Finch:** Could you describe the interior of the cell?
> 
> **SCP-2587-A8:** Dark. Really dark and really cold. Floors felt like concrete, and there was a cot in the corner that I woke up on. I waited for about ten minutes before I hear the door open. I hear this squishing sound get closer to me before I feel something wet grab my arm and pull me into the hallway. There was a bit more light out there and I managed to get a better look at the thing.
> 
> **Dr. Finch:** Could you describe the entity?
> 
> **SCP-2587-A8:** Yeah. It was giant mass of flesh about twice my size. Clear, but it with a blue tint. I could see a man in the center with his head hung. He had his arm pointed towards me, and his fist was clenched.
> 
> **Dr. Finch:** Was there anything else in the hallway?
> 
> **SCP-2587-A8:** Yeah, a bunch of people chained together. These ones were in gowns like me. The blob puts me at the back of the line and leads us down the hall. He gets a couple more people and chains them to me. I think there were about ten to twenty of us in total.
> 
> **Dr. Finch:** Go on.
> 
> **SCP-2587-A8:** So the thing leads us to a room and I get my first glimpse of that...thing.
> 
> **Dr. Finch:** SCP-2587.
> 
> **SCP-2587-A8:** Yes. It looked different back then, though. It didn't have any skin, and it was a lot smaller. The blob unchains the first person in line and shoves her into the mound. The thing grows a bit and spits out her gown after a couple of seconds. He does the same thing with everyone else. I remember getting pushed into the mound, and my memory after that is fuzzy.
> 
> **Dr. Finch:** What is the next thing you clearly remember?
> 
> **SCP-2587-A8:** Surprisingly, I had a couple moments I can remember quite well. I remember being in absolute darkness, unable to breathe. I kept hearing these whispers telling me to do things.
> 
> **Dr. Finch:** What were you told to do?
> 
> **SCP-2587-A8:** Simple things. Kick, curl up, nod your head, and others like that. I was too scared to do anything, so I just stayed perfectly still.  This went on for a while, and then I woke up here.
> 
> **Dr. Finch:** You seem quite calm given your recent experiences.
> 
> **SCP-2587-A8:** I guess I'm just glad to be out in one piece. Everybody else is still in there, yet I was lucky enough to escape. I must be doing something right.
> 
> **Dr. Finch:** That's all for today. Thank you for your time.
> 
> **SCP-2587-A8:** No problem.
