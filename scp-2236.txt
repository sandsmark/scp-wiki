**Item #:** SCP-2236

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2236 is to be stored in its pouch (pictured) when not in use.  The pouch containing SCP-2236 is to be stored in an airtight humidity-controlled and temperature-controlled case.  To prevent security breaches, use of SCP-2236 must be approved by the administrator of Site 32.

**Addendum:** Under no circumstances is SCP-2236 to be brought into the presence of any internal Foundation memoranda or documents, including its own containment records.

**Description:**  SCP-2236 is a cylindrical optical instrument which superficially resembles an early-model pocket microscope.  The instrument is 11.6 cm in length, 1.9 cm in diameter, and has a planoconvex lens at each end with very slight convexity.  One end is equipped with an eyepiece; the other end is flanged at an angle.  The lenses and the body of the instrument enclose an airtight chamber between the lenses.  This chamber is filled with a faintly phosphorescent gas which has not been analyzed.

When a written document is observed through SCP-2236, the content of the text that is examined appears different to the observer.  See testing log.
