**Item #:** SCP-2636

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Revised as of ██/██/2014, in response to Incident 2636-Aleph-Exarch.

SCP-2636 is to be contained within a Type-45 Isolation Chamber within Site-115. All anomalous objects previously stored at Site-115 have been relocated to other sites: those objects that cannot be moved have been placed under increased security as outlined in Document S115-RE-5-D. SCP-2636 is to be provided with half a liter of caprine, ovine, porcine, or bovine blood per day for sustenance. SCP-2636’s respiratory sphincters have been surgically modified to prevent vocalization. Administration of class Omega-3 amnestics to SCP-2636 is authorized.

All procedures involving SCP-2636 are to be carried out through remote automation. All items coming into contact with SCP-2636 are to be sterilized upon removal from the containment chamber.

The security perimeter around SCP-2636-1 is to be monitored by armed patrol and night-vision security cameras. Entry to SCP-2636-1 is reserved for the research team.

Any wild specimens of //Potrix caprarum sapiens// are to be captured for further study.

██/██/2014: UAP-5982-1 through UAP-5982-8 were successfully terminated during Incident 2636-Aleph-Exarch. The remains are currently stored within separate Type-101 Stasis Chambers within Site-115.

██/██/2015: SCP-2636a has been terminated. The remains are currently stored within a Type-101 Stasis Chambers within Site-115

**Description:** SCP-2636 is a female bipedal mammal-like reptile of an unknown species (henceforth referred to as //Potrix caprarum sapiens//), measuring 3.4 meters in height and 135 kilograms in weight. Subject’s skin is smooth and hairless, and is dark red in coloration with a pale grey underbelly. SCP-2636’s primary senses are sight and hearing: the specimen possesses large eyes and ears, with the ears serving the secondary function of removing moving waste heat from the body. All scent organs are effectively vestigial. SCP-2636’s legs are semi-digitigrade, with three toes and a fleshy foot pad to distribute weight, and the hands are four-fingered with one thumb. The head and back bear flexible spines measuring 5-20 cm in length.

SCP-2636’s digestive system is specialized for a liquid diet, primarily blood, though it is capable of digesting vegetable and fungal matter. As such, the mouth structure of SCP-2636 lacks teeth and a functioning mandible, instead consisting of a muscular, bone-tipped proboscis. Venom sacks are located in the upper chest, directly below the collarbone. This venom is a powerful hemorrhagic toxin, capable of liquefying the internal organs of the prey creature. SCP-2636’s respiratory system consists of a series of eight sphincters located in the upper chest and back. 

SCP-2636 is believed to be sapient, due to demonstration of self-recognition, mathematical ability, and artistic expression. However, no successful communication with SCP-2636 beyond simple pantomime and pictograms has been accomplished: SCP-2636 is incapable of speaking human languages, and has made no progress in learning written languages. SCP-2636's native form of communication, a series of song-like vocalizations, is not yet understood. SCP-2636 is highly sensitive to sound, with continuous loud noises (in excess of 100db) triggering hemolacria, otorrhagia, and hematidrosis in the subject. Tissue analysis has shown that SCP-2636 is highly susceptible to chemical carcinogens and pollutants, and possessing of an immune system incapable of protecting SCP-2636 against many human-carried diseases.

SCP-2636’s blood and other body fluids contain a variant of the //Mycobacterium leprae// bacterium, termed //Mycobacterium leprae potrix//. The symptoms of //Mycobacterium leprae potrix// are both accelerated in progression and more severe than those of //Mycobacterium leprae//, and the bacteria have proven resistant to leprostatic agents.

SCP-2636-1 is a pre-Colombian temple complex[[footnote]]This structure appears to be unique amongst //Potrix caprarum sapiens//, as no other permanent structures or settlements have been discovered, and the species is believed to consist primarily of hunter-gatherers. SCP-2636-1 has been considered analogous to the human-derived structures at Göbekli Tepe in this regard.[[/footnote]] located in [REDACTED], Mexico. The architecture of SCP-2636-1 does not match that of any indigenous peoples in the region: the scale of the complex and artistic depictions within indicate that it was constructed by SCP-2636’s species. The oldest segments of SCP-2636-1 [[footnote]]The crypt and main chamber.[[/footnote]] have been dated to approximately 12,000 BCE: the most recent constructions [[footnote]]Antechamber 2 and the Small Temple.[[/footnote]] have been dated to approximately 7500 BCE. 

The central chamber SCP-2636-1 was built with a significant knowledge of acoustics. An individual standing on the central dais is capable of being heard throughout the central chamber without difficulty. Speaking in a raised voice will allow the individual to be heard outside SCP-2636-1 by means of structures funneling sound through the roof of SCP-2636-1.

This central chamber of SCP-2636-1 is built above a natural cave formation, later expanded by the builders of SCP-2636-1. Chambers within the cave were apparently used for storage, residence, and internment of the dead. A total of 3409 skulls belonging to //Potrix caprarum sapiens// specimens have been found within the cave system, dated between c. 12,000 BCE and c. 2000 CE. Entry to the central chamber is made only by passing through two antechambers. A one-room stone structure, referred to as the Small Temple, is located outside the primary structure. The purpose of this structure is unknown.

SCP-2636-2 is a mass of mummified animal parts bound together with hide strips, measuring 4.7 meters in height and weighing approximately 500 kilograms. SCP-2636-2 consists primarily of bones, organs, and limbs, with six goat heads forming the top of the pyramid. The age of SCP-2636-2 is unknown, but the animals used in its construction indicate that it was built after European settlement. It is unknown how SCP-2636-2 has maintained a state of preservation in a tropical environment. 

UAP-5982-1 through UAP-5982-8 are entities outwardly appearing to be a living specimens of SCP-2636-2, bearing no signs of decay and measuring approximately 50 meters in height. It is believed that SCP-2636-2 was envisioned as a representative image of these entities. UAP-5982 specimens have only been observed during Incident 2636-Aleph-Exarch.

██/██/2015: SCP-2636a is a deceased fetal female of the same species as SCP-2636. SCP-2636a is genetically identical to SCP-2636, indicating that the pregnancy was the result of parthenogenesis. Events surrounding the initial generation of SCP-2636a are designated as Incident 2636-Aleph-Exarch.

**Addendum-01:** Certain carvings and paintings within SCP-2636-1 have been deemed to provide further context regarding the nature of SCP-2636, and have been arranged in presumed chronological order, as follows.

* //Potrix caprarum sapiens// in pastoral scenes. Imagery indicates a nocturnal hunter-gatherer lifestyle, with some rudimentary form of fungal agriculture. [[footnote]] All depictions of //Potrix caprarum sapiens// are characterized by a halo or beams emanating from the chest, believed to indicate song. Further symbolism will be added to these images to further specify the motif.[[/footnote]]
* 
* //Potrix caprarum sapiens// killed in large numbers by humans. [[footnote]]Humans on horseback were added to this segment several thousand years after its original creation [[/footnote]] Human figures are portrayed as squat, grotesque figures, with exaggerated mouths and disproportionately small eyes. 
* 
* Retreat of //Potrix caprarum sapiens// below ground and into the remote jungle. Humans displayed as desecrating //Potrix caprarum sapiens// bodies on the surface. Surviving specimens depicted as injured and sickly.
* 
* Construction of SCP-2636-1 and SCP-2636-2 by //Potrix caprarum sapiens//.
* 
* The passing of the lunar cycle, with attendant symbolism to indicate repetition. A procession of female //Potrix caprarum sapiens// stands in from of a dormant SCP-2636-2: all female specimens are pregnant, and making gestures of supplication towards SCP-2636-2.  
* 
* SCP-2636 positioned in front of SCP-2636-2, hands folded in front of its abdomen. Cutaway view of the abdomen shows developing fetus. SCP-2636-2 has extended an arm to touch SCP-2636’s abdomen. SCP-2636-2 is depicted with a song-halo motif for the first time. This motif is significantly deviated from the typical content and style.
* 
* SCP-2636 giving birth to SCP-2636a. Musical motif is a combination of symbols from the depictions of both the pre-human state, the human conflict, and SCP-2636. This is termed the divine motif.
* 
* SCP-2636a presented before SCP-2636-2. SCP-2636-2 is once again portrayed with song-halo motif. In addition, SCP-2636-2 is portrayed in an unmummified state, and as animate.
* 
* SCP-2636a riding SCP-2636-2, driving forth humans, surrounded by a crowd of //Potrix caprarum sapiens//. Divine motif shared by all individuals. SCP-2636-1 is airborne.

**Addendum-02:** Initial recovery of SCP-2636 occurred between ██/██/2013 and ██/██/2014, after an extensive hunt, ending near [REDACTED] Arizona. The complexity of traps used against recovery agents indicated that SCP-2636 worked with the aid of at least one other individual. This individual or individuals have eluded follow up searches of the region, and no further activity has been noted.

**Incident Report 2636-Aleph-Exarch** 

> **Date:** ██/██/2014
> 
> **Location:** Site-151 (Coordinates ██-██.█-██.█)
> 
> **Event Type:** LK (Localized Crisis)
> 
> **Description:** 
> 
> At 0222, local time, SCP-2636 enters labor, beginning songlike vocalizations that will last the entirety of the event. These vocalizations match no patterns observed before, and indicate intense pain.  
> 
> Vocalizations steadily increase in volume as SCP-2636 begins exerting force upon the structure of Site-151, culminating in an outward explosion of force centered around SCP-2636.
> 
> Eight instances of UAP-5982 appear at this time, emerging from the ground around Site-151. 
> 
> SCP-2636 rises into the air, hovering approximately 25 meters off the ground. SCP-2636 develops six wing appendages [[footnote]]These wings have no physical structure, and appear to be projections of light of the same color and luminosity as that given off by UAP-5982 specimens. [[/footnote]] At this point, SCP-2636’s vocalizations have risen to approximately 140 db, and have been joined by similar vocalizations by all eight instances of UAP-5982.
> 
> Vocalizations peak and then begin to recede. UAP-5982 instances each place a hand underneath SCP-2636 and lower it back to the ground. UAP-5982-4 shoots approaching helicopter containing members of MTF Eta-87 out of the air using what appears to be a beam of concentrated light, killing all hands.
> 
> Upon returning to the ground, SCP-2636 falls asleep.
> 
> **Resultant Anomalies and Damages**
> 
> •	Liquefaction of 89% of personnel within Site-151. 
> •	Deafening and blinding of all surviving personnel.
> •	Destruction of 79% of Site-151’s primary structure.
> •	Transmutation of all water within Site-151 into blood containing //Mycobacterium leprae potrix//. 
> •	Generation of eight incidences of UAP-5982.
> •	Generation of SCP-2636a 
> 
> **Recovery Efforts:** Site-151 was retaken by members of Local Task Forces 151-He (“Jared Crump’s Hard-Luck Club”), 151-Yaw (“Pillar Men”), 151-Qoph (“Heavy Metal Queens”), and Mobile Task Force Eta-87 (“Lucky Leftovers”), with the assistance of EWU Squad 7. All instances of UAP-5982 were terminated by 2030, ██/██/2014. Surviving personnel were admitted to intensive treatment at Site-04, Site-78, and Site-115. SCP-2636 and SCP-2636a’s remains were successfully transported to Site-115. SCP-2636 was successfully placed in isolation and administered Omega-3 amnestics without further incident. 
> 
> Media coverup efforts and the remote location of the incident were sufficient to justify the withholding of additional amnestics to the surrounding population beyond standard waterborne rations.
> 
> **Foundation Casualties:** 5 administrative staff, 16 research staff, 20 security staff, 11 D-Class personnel, 45 task force personnel. 
> 
> **Items Lost:** SCP-███, SCP-████, SCP-████, E-█████ through E-█████, and E-█████.

**Addendum-03:** In light of the destructive nature of SCP-2636a, preventative termination of SCP-2636a was proposed and passed by the Overseer Board, with a vote of 8-5, with approval of the Ethics Committee. SCP-2636a was terminated without further incident. 

Analysis of the remains of SCP-2636a indicate that the fetus bore significant physical deformities, and is estimated to have survived no longer than two months after birth. This, combined with SCP-2636a’s method of parthenogenic conception, and the continued mummified and inanimate state of SCP-2636-2, indicates a significant deviation from the events depicted within SCP-2636-1. The consequences, if any, of this deviation are unknown at this time. 

**Addendum-04:** ██/██/2015 – Further physical study of SCP-2636 indicates prior pregnancies.
