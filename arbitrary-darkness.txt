**//[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-003 Biological Motherboard] [for thedeadlymoose]//**

Goddess, mother, anomaly
Building towards its own ideal
We fear what it could grow to be.

Organic piece of circuitry
Living chitin, not cold steel
Goddess, mother, anomaly

Benevolent, otherworldly, 
Infinite, and ethereal
We fear what it could grow to be.

We wonder of its history
There is much more we can reveal
Goddess, mother, anomaly

What could its purpose truly be?
To kill, to rule, to guard, to heal
We fear what it could grow to be.

What lies within her memory?
She thinks, she lives, but does not feel
Goddess, mother, anomaly
We fear what she could grow to be.

**//[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-917 Mr. Moon] [for Dexanote]//**

The Moon accepts with quiet grace
Enduring despite some distress
The shifting phases of his face

Like waning light, features erase
Perceptions dim, later regress
The Moon accepts with quiet grace

Eyes, ears, nose, fade without trace
He copes with fate, nevertheless
The shifting phases of his face

A simple life he does embrace
Persevering with finesse
The Moon accepts with quiet grace

Despite the losses that take place
He is not worried to possess
The shifting phases of his face

He calmly lives at his own pace
This man of lunar stateliness
This Mister Moon accepts with grace
The shifting phases of his face.

**//[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1293 Squeedle Deedle Dee!] [for PeppersGhost]//**

We are the happy as can be!
It’s apsa-tapsa-lutely true
Squeedle deedle deedle-ly dee!

We’ll dance for you so merrily
Ballet and jigs and Broadway, too
We are the happy as can be!

We seek children of heart goodly
It’s how we live and what we do
Squeedle deedle deedle-ly dee!

Our imaginations are scary
But you know how to help us through
We are the happy as can be!

We thrive because of you, you see
For your great help, our thanks are due!
Squeedle deedle deedle-ly dee!

Not all of us have arms, but we
Still wish we could hug all of you
We are the happy as can be
Squeedle deedle deedle-ly dee!

[[tab 1468]]

**//[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1468 Literature Birds]//**

Just the carving of stories is all that we need
We strain and we struggle for our own grand behest
Not a thing can compare to these words that we read

We care not for ourselves and the bounds we exceed
Yes it hurts, but we find that we have no protest
Just the carving of stories is all that we need

Through this task we press on, seldom rest, seldom feed
All our lives, all our strength we thus put to the test
Not a thing can compare to these words that we read

We have seen your efforts, crafts made by human deed
Your ink-covered paper is imperfect at best
Just the carving of stories is all that we need

To our beaks and our stomachs we pay little heed
There is only the words and the stories, our quest
Not a thing can compare to these words that we read

We do not think too much of the day we’ll succeed
What matters is the journey and how we’ve progressed
Just the carving of stories is all that we need
Not a thing can compare to these words that we read

[[tab 1522]]

**//[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1522 Ships That Pass In The Night] [for FlameShirt]//**

Despite all that’s happened, we’re truly happy
All the dangers have passed, we’re safe and alright
To live and to love in the midst of the sea

Side by side always is what we wished to be
We’re lucky enough to have loved at first sight,
Despite all that’s happened, we’re truly happy

We’ve spent many moments content as can be
To whale-watch together in fading sunlight
To live and to love in the midst of the sea

We do recall sometimes that dark memory
We think of the chasing, the harpoons in sight
Despite all that’s happened, we’re truly happy

No matter what iceberg or weapon deadly
Forever, we’d promised, regardless of plight
To live and to love in the midst of the sea

Though now we no longer can travel freely
We’re still glad we didn’t just pass in the night
Despite all that’s happened, we’re truly happy
To live and to love by the shore of the sea

**//[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1553 Dr. Wondertainment's Shadow Paint Play-Set!] [for FortuneFavorsBold]//**

Create, erase, enjoy the sight
Coax forms to dance in blackest paint
Bring darkness to the life of light

Whether drawing beast, maid, or knight
We’re sure that you’ll have no complaint
Create, erase, enjoy the sight

With Ani-Magi-Nation might
Draw power into forms once faint 
Bring darkness to the life of light

Please make sure that the lighting’s right
Remember to use with restraint!
Create, erase, enjoy the sight

There’s no more need to fear the night
Such terrors are now simply quaint
Bring darkness to the life of light

So dream on, we’re sure you’ll delight
In shadowplay without constraint
Create, erase, enjoy the sight
Bring darkness to the life of light.

**//[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1832 Faith Half-Healer] [for Gaffney]//**

I was never really a fraud
I simply act the way I must
I know how it feels, to be God.

The Lord’s strength fills me, full and broad
My healings were all built on trust
I was never really a fraud

I lead the masses trite and awed
Mete punishment for sin and lust
I know how it feels, to be God.

I see through lies, condemn the flawed
Work miracles as I see just
I never really was a fraud

I’ve gone past where preachers have trod
Condemn the fragile to the dust
I know how it feels, to be God.

Although my actions earn no laud
I can’t just let my talents rust
I never really was a fraud
I know how it feels, to be God.

**//[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1863 Lime Liftoff and Sarsaparilla Cream] [for Ihpkmn]//**

[[div style="float:left; width: 45%; padding: 0 2%"]]
It’s clear which soda you’ll love more
Lime Liftoff lifts you to the sky
To friendly rivals, THIS MEANS WAR

We know what privileged folk look for
Know what the high class wants to buy
It’s clear which soda you’ll love more

Above uncultured slobs you’ll soar
Elite taste is the way to fly
To friendly rivals, THIS MEANS WAR

Your life depends on it, we’re sure
A shame should your flight go awry
It’s clear which soda you’ll love more

Sarsaparilla will make you snore
Cream’s really so mundane you’d die
To friendly rivals, THIS MEANS WAR

The fruit of knowledge all adore
Is the lime; we will not deny
It’s clear which soda you’ll love more
To friendly rivals, THIS MEANS WAR
[[/div]]

[[div style="float:left; width: 45%; padding: 0 2%"]]
It’s clear which soda you’ll love more
Our Sarsaparilla Cream’s the best
To friendly rivals, THIS MEANS WAR

For a great price at any store
From Carl’s Caffeine Club, we attest
It’s clear which soda you’ll love more

Breathtaking taste none can ignore
Go on and put it to the test
To friendly rivals, THIS MEANS WAR

Never again breathe muck or gore
This drink was made to soothe the stressed
It’s clear which soda you’ll love more

Lime Liftoff is what we abhor
Elitists simply can’t contest
To friendly rivals, THIS MEANS WAR

Those Limey Drinkers are a bore
So //let them burn//, we do suggest
It’s clear which soda you’ll love more
To friendly rivals, THIS MEANS WAR

Twirling through the ocean vast
Two of us, in endless dance
Side by side two nets are cast.

##00CC00|Searching, seeking, lightning-fast##
##00CC00|Won’t you spare me one more glance? ##
##00CC00|Twirling through the ocean vast##

##FF6600|Find me with your words amassed##
##FF6600|Drift to me, through time’s expanse ##
##FF6600|Side by side two nets are cast. ##

##00CC00|Loneliness we will outlast##
##00CC00|Aim, adjust, once more advance##
##00CC00|Twirling through the ocean vast##

##FF6600|We will face this space contrast##
##FF6600|Trust our love, our lives to chance##
##FF6600|Side by side two nets are cast. ##

Think not of the trials we’ve passed
How we’ve burned for this romance-- 
Twirling through the ocean vast
##00CC00|Side## by ##FF6600|side##, we’re **##FFFF00|whole##** at last.
