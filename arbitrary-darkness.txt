Goddess, mother, anomaly
Building towards its own ideal
We fear what it could grow to be.

Organic piece of circuitry
Living chitin, not cold steel
Goddess, mother, anomaly

Benevolent, otherworldly, 
Infinite, and ethereal
We fear what it could grow to be.

We wonder of its history
There is much more we can reveal
Goddess, mother, anomaly

What could its purpose truly be?
To kill, to rule, to guard, to heal
We fear what it could grow to be.

What lies within her memory?
She thinks, she lives, but does not feel
Goddess, mother, anomaly
We fear what she could grow to be.

Just the carving of stories is all that we need
We strain and we struggle for our own grand behest
Not a thing can compare to these words that we read

We care not for ourselves and the bounds we exceed
Yes it hurts, but we find that we have no protest
Just the carving of stories is all that we need

Through this task we press on, seldom rest, seldom feed
All our lives, all our strength we thus put to the test
Not a thing can compare to these words that we read

We have seen your efforts, crafts made by human deed
Your ink-covered paper is imperfect at best
Just the carving of stories is all that we need

To our beaks and our stomachs we pay little heed
There is only the words and the stories, our quest
Not a thing can compare to these words that we read

We do not think too much of the day we’ll succeed
What matters is the journey and how we’ve progressed
Just the carving of stories is all that we need
Not a thing can compare to these words that we read
