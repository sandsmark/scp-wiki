Goddess, mother, anomaly
Building towards its own ideal
We fear what it could grow to be.

Organic piece of circuitry
Living chitin, not cold steel
Goddess, mother, anomaly

Benevolent, otherworldly, 
Infinite, and ethereal
We fear what it could grow to be.

We wonder of its history
There is much more we can reveal
Goddess, mother, anomaly

What could its purpose truly be?
To kill, to rule, to guard, to heal
We fear what it could grow to be.

What lies within her memory?
She thinks, she lives, but does not feel
Goddess, mother, anomaly
We fear what she could grow to be.

Just the carving of stories is all that we need
We strain and we struggle for our own grand behest
Not a thing can compare to these words that we read

We care not for ourselves and the bounds we exceed
Yes it hurts, but we find that we have no protest
Just the carving of stories is all that we need

Through this task we press on, seldom rest, seldom feed
All our lives, all our strength we thus put to the test
Not a thing can compare to these words that we read

We have seen your efforts, crafts made by human deed
Your ink-covered paper is imperfect at best
Just the carving of stories is all that we need

To our beaks and our stomachs we pay little heed
There is only the words and the stories, our quest
Not a thing can compare to these words that we read

We do not think too much of the day we’ll succeed
What matters is the journey and how we’ve progressed
Just the carving of stories is all that we need
Not a thing can compare to these words that we read

**//[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1522 Ships That Pass In The Night] [for FlameShirt]//**

Despite all that’s happened, we’re truly happy
All the dangers have passed, we’re safe and alright
To live and to love in the midst of the sea

Side by side always is what we wished to be
We’re lucky enough to have loved at first sight,
Despite all that’s happened, we’re truly happy

We’ve spent many moments content as can be
To whale-watch together in fading sunlight
To live and to love in the midst of the sea

We do recall sometimes that dark memory
We think of the chasing, the harpoons in sight
Despite all that’s happened, we’re truly happy

No matter what iceberg or weapon deadly
Forever, we’d promised, regardless of plight
To live and to love in the midst of the sea

Though now we no longer can travel freely
We’re still glad we didn’t just pass in the night
Despite all that’s happened, we’re truly happy
To live and to love by the shore of the sea

**//[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1832 Faith Half-Healer] [for Gaffney]//**

I was never really a fraud
I simply act the way I must
I know how it feels, to be God.

The Lord’s strength fills me, full and broad
My healings were all built on trust
I was never really a fraud

I lead the masses trite and awed
Mete punishment for sin and lust
I know how it feels, to be God.

I see through lies, condemn the flawed
Work miracles as I see just
I never really was a fraud

I’ve gone past where preachers have trod
Condemn the fragile to the dust
I know how it feels, to be God.

Although my actions earn no laud
I can’t just let my talents rust
I never really was a fraud
I know how it feels, to be God.
