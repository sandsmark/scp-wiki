**RE:** SCP-001
**URGENCY:** HIGH

we need all attention on dealing with the current situation now. the first part is to put the rumors to rest and to get you all to focus on what we're doing next. this is the first and last time any of you will see an official transcript of an O5 vote. there will be no questions. 

the file for 001 is attached. we declassified it this morning. go out there and keep buying us time.
