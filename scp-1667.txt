**Item #:** SCP-1667

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** All known articles of footwear affected by SCP-1667 are to be stored in Containment Locker 16 at Storage Site-23. Due to the contagious nature of SCP-1667's effects, no shoes, boots, sandals, flip-flops, slippers, flippers, footwraps, galoshes, mocassins or clogs are permitted to enter a four (4) meter radius surrounding Containment Locker 16 without the prior approval of Researcher ████████. Socks are permitted. On a fortnightly basis, one (1) member of personnel must carefully open Containment Locker 16 and replace all footwear inside to its most northwesterly positions. In the event of a containment breach caused by pressure-related internal damage to SCP-1667's container, all footwear affected by SCP-1667 is to be recontained and Containment Locker 16 reinforced.

**Description:** SCP-1667 is a contagion that spreads between almost any type of footwear. Any organism wearing or in physical contact with an item of footwear affected by SCP-1667 is compelled to reach an unknown location deep below the central Pacific Ocean, regardless of personal danger. Almost all items of footwear, the main exception being socks, are susceptible to contagion of SCP-1667. Organisms affected by SCP-1667 will attempt to remain in physical contact with affected footwear. Humans under the effects of SCP-1667 are able to communicate semi-rationally but are primarily driven by their goal to enter the Pacific Ocean and may become physically violent in order to achieve it. Class D personnel under the effects of SCP-1667 were able to use basic navigation skills to avoid obstacles in their path yet always selected travelling on foot over the use of any type of vehicle. Footwear affected by SCP-1667 has been noticed over time by staff slowly moving south-west in a linear pattern, at a rate of approximately 12.7cm per week. It is speculated that the effects of SCP-1667 have caused many humans and possibly other land animals to drown with the appearance of suicidal intent.

The first object discovered to be affected by SCP-1667 was a brown and red, leather hiking boot (hereafter referred to as SCP-1667-1) recovered from █████ Beach, ████████, New Zealand in 19██. The contagious nature of SCP-1667 was discovered when other articles of footwear brought within an approximately two (2) meter radius of SCP-1667-1 began to produce the same effects after a short exposure time. ████ (█) members of Mobile Task Force ██-█ did not remove their boots during the recovery of SCP-1667-1 from █████ Beach and in the resulting chaos, [DATA EXPUNGED].

__Log 02/03/██__
> **Affected Item/s:** SCP-1667-2
> **Description:** Black combat boot, owner deceased.
> **Unaffected Item:** Black business shoe, owned by Researcher ████████, held by Subject D-8267
> **Objective:** To observe the range of SCP-1667's effects.
> **Results:** Effects of SCP-1667 manifested in black business shoe (and D-8267) after approximately 8.41 seconds of exposure from 2 meters distance. Black business shoe reclassified as SCP-1667-11.
>
> **Affected Item/s:** SCP-1667-11
> **Description:** Black business shoe, owned by Researcher ████████.
> **Unaffected Item:** Subject D-8267, female, Hispanic, 26 years old, 67kg, 158cm tall
> **Objective:** To observe a human under the effects of SCP-1667.
> **Results:** Subject held SCP-1667-11 against her chest and began running towards the door. When subject's path was blocked by Researcher ████████, subject stated "Move". When Researcher ████████ did not, subject kicked Researcher ████████ in the groin and sprinted from the room. Subject attempted to leave facility and was terminated. SCP-1667-11 was partially damaged and has been discontinued from further testing.

__Log 02/04/██__
> **Affected Item/s:** SCP-1667-2
> **Description:** Black combat boot, owner deceased.
> **Unaffected Item:** Irish Terrier, female, golden red, 4 years old, 13kg, 39cm tall, GPS tracker implanted
> **Objective:** To determine whether SCP-1667 affects animals other than humans.
> **Results:** Effects of SCP-1667 manifested in subject after approximately 5.23 seconds of physical attachment. Subject was released from facility and tracked south-west for approximately eight (8) kilometers via GPS. Signal lost after 53 minutes, 49 seconds on ████████ Beach. SCP-1667-2 presumed destroyed.

__Log 02/05/██__
> **Affected Item/s:** SCP-1667-3
> **Description:** Black combat boot, owner deceased.
> **Unaffected Item:** //Parthenocissus quinquefolia// (also known as Virginia creeper)
> **Objective:** To determine whether SCP-1667 affects organisms other than animals.
> **Results:** Effects of SCP-1667 noticably manifested in subject after approximately one (1) week of physical attachment. Subject grew approximately three (3) millimeters south-west, differing from its natural eastward growth direction. SCP-1667-3 detached from subject.

__Log 02/12/██__
> **Affected Item/s:** SCP-1667-3
> **Description:** Black combat boot, owner deceased.
> **Unaffected Item:** Common bottlenose dolphin, male, grey, 15 years old, 452kg, 3.62m long, underwater video camera attached, GPS tracker implanted
> **Objective:** To discover the location SCP-1667 leads its victims to.
> **Results:** Effects of SCP-1667 manifested in subject after approximately 54.3 seconds of physical attachment. Subject was released from ████████ Beach and tracked south-west for approximately 3500 kilometers before signal was lost. Subject was noted to have begun increasing in speed exponentially after it reached coordinates ██°S ███°W. Video footage revealed nothing of interest. SCP-1667-3 presumed destroyed.

__Log 02/17/██__
> **Affected Item/s:** SCP-1667-4
> **Description:** Black combat boot, owner deceased.
> **Unaffected Item:** Two (2) navy blue flippers, owned by Agent █████, held by Subject D-8268
> **Objective:** To spread SCP-1667's effects to a pair of flippers.
> **Results:** Effects of SCP-1667 manifested in navy blue flippers (and D-8268) after approximately 10.13 seconds of exposure from 2 meters distance. Navy blue flippers reclassified as SCP-1667-12 and SCP-1667-13 respectively.
>
> **Affected Item/s:** SCP-1667-12 and SCP-1667-13
> **Description:** Two (2) navy blue flippers, owned by Agent █████.
> **Unaffected Item:** Subject D-8268, male, Caucasian, 32 years old, 77kg, 179cm tall, wearing Atmospheric Diving Suit (ADS) with underwater video camera and audio communicator attached, GPS tracker implanted
> **Objective:** To discover the location SCP-1667 leads its victims to.
> **Results:** Subject was released from ████████ Beach and tracked to coordinates ██°S ███°W. Once D-8268 reached this location, video feed was lost due to equipment failure and subject began noticably increasing in speed. Analysis of background noise in the audio feed and the muttered commentary of subject D-8268 indicated movement of an underwater entity at least ███ meters in length before [DATA EXPUNGED] resulting in the loss of audio feed and GPS tracking. Notably, 3 minutes and 17 seconds before signal was lost D-8268 claimed to observe [REDACTED], however further investigation should be considered unnecessary as it is presumed subject was simply experiencing visual hallucinations at the time, possibly pressure-related. SCP-1667-12 and SCP-1667-13 presumed destroyed.
