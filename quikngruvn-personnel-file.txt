**Name:** Quikngruvn Halifax

**Security Clearance Level:** 3

**Position:** Archivist

**Duties:** Proofread, edit, maintain and update archived documents and media related to SCPs; data security, backup, and disaster recovery

**Biography:** Mr. Halifax was recruited straight out of graduate school by the Foundation at a job fair in [DATA EXPUNGED] and was offered a position as a staff archivist. In addition to adding, expanding, revising, and updating numerous primary and secondary SCP-related documents, he has also helped develop and implement data redundancy and disaster-recovery protocols across multiple sites.

**Personal:** Mr. Halifax lives by the credo, “A place for everything, and everything in its place.” He is anal-retentive about organization almost to the point of compulsion, keeping himself and his office freakishly tidy, uncluttered, and well-organized.

Mr. Halifax tends to spend long hours in his office working on documentation, with his office sound system blaring most any type of music at high volume. Visitors are advised to ring the doorbell to his office, as knocking will most likely not be noticed.
