**Item #:** SCP-094

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** As SCP-094 is immobile, Site-94 was constructed around it, which grew into Dimensional Research Site-94 [DRS94]. No other research objects contained within DRS94 are to be brought within 100 feet of SCP-094, except in the event of O5-approved experimentation. For their own safety, personnel are not to enter the chamber containing SCP-094 under any circumstances.

**Description:** SCP-094 was first detected as an anomalous area in southern Argentina where numerous people, vehicles, and livestock had been lost. Investigation uncovered a large "gap" at the center of the area where air had apparently been displaced. Extensive testing revealed SCP-094 to be a miniature event horizon, spherical and roughly 50 meters in diameter. SCP-094 was initially believed to be a black hole, as no matter was capable of escaping it once crossing the event horizon. Similar to a black hole, light itself is unable to escape from SCP-094 once crossing its event horizon, causing SCP-094 to appear perfectly black. However, unlike a black hole, SCP-094 does not possess a gravitational field.

SCP-094 has been known on occasion to emit a number of different sounds, ranging from ambient noise of nature, to static buzzing, and on some occasions human speech. No attempts to communicate with SCP-094 have yet succeeded. It is unknown whether these sounds come from SCP-094 itself, from some thing or things inside of SCP-094, or from some area that connects through SCP-094. A small number of subjects have reported feeling a strong urge to cross the event horizon upon visual contact with SCP-094. Because of this, the chamber containing SCP-094 is not to be entered except by authorized research teams. Any personnel attempting to enter SCP-094 are to be confined to quarters for 24 hours for SCP-094's effects to wear off, and afterward should not be part of any experiment related to SCP-094.
