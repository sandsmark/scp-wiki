RequiteFahrenheit is employed by the Foundation as a Mathematician and Magical Realist.
He is a Buddhist--in the event of an accident, please call a llama.

In his off hours, as he puts it:

  "He dwells within the Ministry of Chance
  Turning words into numbers
  And then the numbers do dance."

Oddly, RequiteFahrenheit is an anagram of his duress challenge, "I Hired Frequent Heat"

**Description:** 


SCP-XXX-A is an illegal street drug known variously as 'asterisk', 'bo', and 'trip'. SCP-XXX-A began surfacing in late 2014 in Asia Minor and has since made its way to Europe and North America.
Typically ingested by infumation, the substance acts as a psychedelic and stimulant, producing a very short-acting experience typified by a feeling of euphoria accompanied by vivid hallucinations of a geometric or fractal nature. Side effects include extreme hunger and thirst.

SCP-XXX-A is highly addictive, leading users to consume greater and greater quantities in a short amount of time. Of note is the unusual degree of agreement among users in the type imagery experienced, the obsession to recall these experiences, and the compulsion to produce representations of them (these representations are referred to as SCP-XXX-b). Failure to do so (when, for instance, confined or under medical care) produces a sharp sense of anxiety or dread. Note: these effects are distinct from the more conventional withdrawal systems experience when the drug itself is unavailable.

Examples of SCP-XXX-b have included drawings, sculpture, computer simulations, and, in one case, an attempt to produce a life size model.
