RequiteFahrenheit is employed by the Foundation as a Mathematician and Magical Realist.
In his off hours:

  "He dwells within the Ministry of Chance
  Turning words into numbers
  And then the numbers do dance."

Oddly, RequiteFahrenheit is an anagram of his duress challenge, "I Hired Frequent Heat"

He is a Buddhist. In the event of an accident, please call a llama.
