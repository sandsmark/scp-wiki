RequiteFahrenheit is employed by the Foundation as a Mathematician and Magical Realist.
He is a Buddhist--in the event of an accident, please call a llama.

In his off hours, as he puts it:

  "He dwells within the Ministry of Chance
  Turning words into numbers
  And then the numbers do dance."

Oddly, RequiteFahrenheit is an anagram of his duress challenge, "I Hired Frequent Heat"

**Description:** 


SCP-XXX is an illegal street drug known variously as 'aster', 'zezna', and 'tojkef'. SCP-XXX-A began surfacing in late 2014 in Asia Minor and has since made its way to Europe and North America. Dealers have proven useless as an means of discovering the source of the drug. In every instance they have professed a complete ignorance of how they acquired it, a claim supported by the negative results of strenuous interrogation.

Typically ingested by infumation, the substance acts as a psychedelic and stimulant, producing a very short-acting experience typified by a feeling of euphoria accompanied by vivid hallucinations of a geometric nature. Side effects include extreme hunger and thirst. SCP-XXX-A is highly addictive, leading users to consume greater and greater quantities in a short amount of time. Although spectroscopic analysis has proven successful in identifying the drugs chemical, the Foundation has been unable to synthesize it.

Of note is the unusual degree of agreement between users of the kind of imagery experienced. After using the drug for a short time, the desire to recall these experiences becomes pronounced, usually leading users to attempt stylized reproductions. Failure to do so on the part of the user (when, for instance, confined or under medical care) produces a sharp sense of anxiety or dread. Note: these effects are distinct from the more conventional withdrawal systems experience when the drug itself is unavailable.

Examples of the attempts have included drawings, sculpture, computer simulations, and, in one case, a 900^2 meter model.

Roughly 1 in 100,00 users have an atypical reaction. Characterized by an absence of the ability to sleep and an almost savant-like ability to represent the drug experience, this had led this atypical group to produce much more ambitious works. The one actualized attempt is referred to as SCP-XXXX-N.
