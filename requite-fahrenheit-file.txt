RequiteFahrenheit is employed by the Foundation as a Mathematician and Magical Realist.
He is a Buddhist--in the event of an accident, please call a llama.

In his off hours, as he puts it:

  "He dwells within the Ministry of Chance
  Turning words into numbers
  And then the numbers do dance."

Oddly, RequiteFahrenheit is an anagram of his duress challenge, "I Hired Frequent Heat"
