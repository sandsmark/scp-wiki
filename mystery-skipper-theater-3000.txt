In the not too distant future♪ ♫ ♬

Next XK, A.D

Doctor Kondraki and his [[[scp-408| booterflies]]]

Are more sinister than they seem.

@@@@

Hired an Agent, Navarro's the name

A magic user of [[[three-portlands-hub| Three Portlands]]] fame.

He did a good job keeping us all safe

But Kondraki didn't like it so he shot him into space!

@@@@

= ,,(Get! Me! DOWN!!!),,

"I'll send him lazy scippys,"

"The worst, I can write!"

"He'll have to sit and choke them down,"

"Until he loses his own mind!"

@@@@

Now keep in mind Navarro hasn't gone around the bend just yet

//(La La La)//

Because he stole conversational skips

To be his robot friends!

@@@@

+ ROBOT ROLL CALL

[[[scp-160| Dronebot!]]] //(Go higher!)//

[[[SCP-1370| Pesterbot!]]] //(I'll get you!)//

[[[scp-958| General Beep!]]] //(Bombs away!)//

[[[scp-846| ROBO-DUDE]]] //(HEY NOW!)//

@@@@

If you're wondering why he can't just leave

Or the plausibility of this act

Then repeat to yourself "The Foundation is fake,"

"I should really just relax!"

For Mystery Science Theater... 3000!

[ //Establishing shot, drawing back from a series of containment chamber doors, until we see NAVARRO standing behind a desk with GENERAL BEEP and ROBO-DUDE. A DRONE appears to be directing the camera.// ]

**NAVARRO:** Hey folks! Welcome, uh, to the Satellite of Love. I'm not sure how long I've been up here but don't worry -- at no point has it gotten any less tedious.

**GENERAL BEEP:** It almost makes you want to see what the Kon has in store for us next.

**NAVARRO:** Yeah, almost... but not quite.

**ROBO-DUDE:** INCOMING TRANSMISSION! SITE-19 DOCTOR KONDRAKI! I AM MAKING AN ANNOUNCEMENT! 

**NAVARRO:** Whelp, speak of the devil, I suppose...

[ A screen appears, upon which DR. KONDRAKI'S face is displayed. KONDRAKI appears to be slightly disheveled and several butterflies are crawling on his face. ]

**KONDRAKI:** Hello, Navarro. How's the weather up there?

**NAVARRO:** Same as yesterday... a nice hot slice of nothing.

**KONDRAKI:** Well, I've got something for you today that might liven things up a bit. Are you ready? It's a doozy, this one...

**NAVARRO:** Yes. I am so excited. Please. Give it to me. Send your SCP signal into my Satellite of Love.

**KONDRAKI:** You're feeling snippy now, but you'll be lucky to have any feelings left after watching... //[[[scp-foundation-the-movie| SCP Foundation: The Movie!]]]//

**NAVARRO, BOTS:** OH NO!

[ Camera zooms back in through the doors. NAVARRO and THE BOTS briefly visible leaping into a conveniently located movie theater hatch. ]

= [ //EXTRENIOUS DETAIL REDACTED// ]

[ //NAVARRO, ROBO-DUDE AND GENERAL BEEP are visible in silhouette, in front of a movie screen// ]

**NAVARRO:** Brought to you by Soaps from Corpses Products!

**GENERAL BEEP:** Soap? I thought it was Salman for Controlled Pesticides.

**ROBO DUDE:** WHAT ABOUT-

**NAVARRO, BEEP:** Shhhhhhh! 

[ //Movie playback continues normally, for approximately 45 minutes, with riffing.// ]

**PESTERBOT:** [ //Stumbling in from off-screen// ] I will destroy you, but first, Navarro, you must-

**NAVARRO:** Wait, what? What's going on?

**GENERAL BEEP:** You dare you interrupt the proceedings‽ We may have to watch this over again! I'll have you court-martialed!

**PESTERBOT:** How dare //you// besmirch me when I merely come to warn Navarro? Your souls shall suffer in the deepest pits of-

**NAVARRO:** Nevermind that, what's going on?

**PESTERBOT:** Although deeply offended, and murderous, I will inform you. There is a celestial body rapidly approaching the Satellite of Love, and-

**ROBO DUDE:** WHAT IS GOING ON?

**ALL:** SHUSH!

**NAVARRO:** Will everybody please shut up so that I can-- is it getting hot in here?

[ //[[[SCP-1548| THE HATEFUL STAR]]] SUDDENLY EXPLODES THROUGH THE SCREEN. INSTANTLY, THE ROOM IS ENGULFED WITH FLAMES.// ]

**THE HATEFUL STAR:** AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

**NAVARRO:** AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

**BOTS:** AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

**THE HATEFUL STAR:** AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAND YOUR MOVIE SUUUUUUUCKS

[ //CAMERA IS APPARENTLY DISABLED THROUGH EXTREME TEMPERATURES. NO FURTHER BROADCASTS DETECTED.// ]

> Note from Dr. Edison: How dare they desecrate my cinematic masterpiece. Comparing the directing to drunken, headless chickens stapled together to act as a steadycam operator was completely over the top. I also did not appreciate the repeated comparing and contrasting of my cinematic skills to other scientists with my name. I demand that this be expunged from the record!
