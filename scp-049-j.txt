**Item #:** SCP-049-J

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-049-J is contained at --Site-19-- --Site-101-- --Site-17-- --Site-81-- --Site-13-- Special Restricted High Security Top Secret MK-Ultra Area Region Landmass 101.5 WFML near Richmond, VA. SCP-049-J is permitted to leave its holding cell only under supervision of two (2) (II) (两[[footnote]]During the development of SCP-049-Js containment procedures, while the two guards discussed whether 二 might be more appropriate than 两 for use in the documentation, SCP-049-J hastily climbed out a window and descended a fire escape.[[/footnote]]) (dos) guards armed with AR-15 rifles and stun batons. 

Due to olfactory concerns for staff assigned to SCP-049-J, the entity is no longer allowed to remove its mask.

**Description:** SCP-049-J is a humanoid entity wearing the period appropriate garb of a medieval plague doctor. Further analysis of SCP-049-J has revealed that under its robes, the entity is composed mostly of moss, wads of tissue, and other, smaller plague doctor masks. It is generally compliant with Foundation staff, but will sometimes lie and occasionally sweat profusely for no reason whatsoever.

During SCP-049-J’s time in Foundation custody, it has continually claimed to be a powerful magical doctor wizard, capable of “curing” that which “ails mankind”. To date, it has been unable to cure literally anything, and typically only exacerbates conditions considerably. 

While this alone would not be enough for the Foundation to hold SCP-049-J indefinitely as an anomalous entity, it has also proven capable of somehow always evading capture and escaping from Foundation sites after its true lack of capabilities are revealed. Because of this, and because of staff’s unwavering curiosity as to whether it has any of the self-proclaimed magical healing abilities it describes, SCP-049-J is to be housed and treated as an anomalous entity.
