**Item №:** SCP-4736

**Anomaly Class:** Thaumiel-numen[[footnote]] Antiquated Divinity-Type subclass repurposed out of respect for the deceased. [[/footnote]]

**Object Class:** Decommissioned (Informal)

**Special Containment Procedures:** Containment has been rendered unnecessary by Operation Astaroth. The corpse once held by Foundation High Command is now buried in an Arizonan field per the deceased's request.

Previous containment procedures have been supplanted in the wake of Operation Astaroth. Give your thanks to the deceased and then depart.

**Description:** The deceased[[footnote]]Hereafter cataloged as SCP-4736 out of formality.[[/footnote]] was a Class-V Manufactured Theo-Weapon of transhuman origin. Its last will and testament indicate that it answered to the name "Robin" and was aged twenty-four[[footnote]] Standard Sol-revolution year. [[/footnote]] upon death. However, this information was rendered inaccurate upon its creation.

SCP-4736 had access to vast energies[[footnote]] Gamma-type controlled power emissions; baseline for Class-V Theo-Weapons produced in the modern era. [[/footnote]] while under Foundation custody as a result of its inextricable self-relation. This self-relation extended to all aspects of its intersection with hyper-conceptual reality (AKA the Infosphere, the post-dormant Noosphere, the aggregate deific realm), rendering all attempted metaphysical assaults ineffective so long as SCP-4736 understood itself to be immune.

Per accepted workings of forced apotheosis, SCP-4736's previous identity was retroactively purged from hyper-conceptual reality and repurposed into a weapon useful to the Foundation. Following the implementation of a [[[SCP-2578 | hypnestic]]][[footnote]] An injection-based method of altering and manipulating human thought. [[/footnote]]-loaded subdermal [[[SCP-1463|auto-injector]]][[footnote]] Dose Alpha-Cameo; baseline for Class-V Theo-Weapons produced in the modern era. [[/footnote]], it performed certain actions guided by Foundation Central Control such that Operation Astaroth became feasible.

Accolades have been rendered unnecessary by Operation Astaroth. The following remain unawarded to the deceased:

* Foundation Medal of Honor (Bravery, Accomplishment, Control)
* Foundation Consolation for Theft of Human Goodness (Irreversible)
* General human recognition/appreciation (Rendered unnecessary)
* Foundation Recognition of Theocide (First Class)

**{{PERSONNEL INVOLVED:}}** SCP-4736, Sr. Researcher Preston Bracks (SiteCommand)

**{{STATION:}}** Site-873

**{{PURPOSE:}}** The necessity of the operation was confirmed by Overwatch Command on May 26, 2005, in order to achieve optimal containment. During the initial stages of the operation, SCP-4736 was housed within Site-873's Medical Bay. A paratechnological scrying-tool was utilized to view its surroundings once it escaped baseline reality; its remains stayed unmoving within Site-873.

**SiteCommand:** Incorrect. The choice has been made, and you do not live in a world without consequences.

**SCP-4736:** Can I, uh, speak with someone else? I feel like I need some clarification on what I'm doing here.

**SiteCommand:** All complaints should have been filed before the operation began. Now, you have a job to do.

Ironworks and labors of absurdity rise before her into an acrid sky. The GATE and its wall are damaged irreparably  — inoperabilities rent into firmament beyond.

**SiteCommand:** Would you like to file for clarity of purpose?

**SiteCommand:** Is there a problem?

**SCP-4736:** Why does it say two different things here? Oh, wait... are these two different forms? Which one am I supposed to follow?

**SiteCommand:** The question confuses us.

**SiteCommand:** In order to prevent knowledge of clarity from being leaked, several/no false files have been created alongside the true file/files. Revealing the true nature/natures of clarity to the general public is cause for execution, except as required under ████-███-██████.

**[04:14]** – **[16:22]** SiteCommand leaves Site-873 to travel directly to Regional Command, presumably to terminate the SCP-4736 operation. SiteCommand navigates to the 23rd floor of the facility and submits his proposal; however, the paperwork is destroyed immediately afterwards due to an ongoing catastrophic containment failure. This containment failure began as a result of the SCP-4736 project, which SiteCommand is forced to return to.

SiteCommand differs to the Overseer Council.

**[016:23]** //One-way audio-visual connection is re-established. Subject is located in an unknown forest, leaning against a tree and reading the dictionary. The trees are of cyclopean proportions, over-stimulated by life. Subject clutches something unknown in her palm.//

**SCP-4736:** Are you back? Inject me with something if you are.

**[16:24]** //EMPRESS-Grade hypnestic injected. The forest surrounding subject is consumed in a fire which spreads from her feet. Several unidentified humanoid entities fall from the treetops and run from the scene. Subject smiles.//

**SCP-4736:** I've been doing some reading since we last spoke. This book taught me a lot about weapons, especially the ones you developed. And every firearm needs a holder.

**SCP-4736:** I think I'm called a Theo-Weapon: very succinct, very straight-forward. That's not very like you, is it? You seem like you're all about complications and wrinkles in plans.

**[16:25]** //HIEROPHANT-Grade hypnestic injected. Subject is compelled to walk to its final destination. As she does, one of the entities tails her, darting between the remains of trees; on its forehead is branded the symbol of a hand.//

**[16:27]** – **[17:01]** SiteCommand attempts entry into Site-001, which entered conceptual lockdown in preparation for Operation Astaroth. SiteCommand's security credentials are denied; entry is achieved via the firearm[[footnote]] "Firearm; noun: a weapon." [[/footnote]] which SCP-4736 neglected.

SiteCommand is eventually turned back. The reasons are unclear and irrelevant; the SCP-4736 project was never going to be stopped.

**[23:50]** //Total connection is re-established with Site-873. Subject has entered the sewer system beneath the FINAL GATE and trudges through the dark. Every seven steps there is damage to the brick walls which suggests recent and violent entry.//

[[div class="dialogue"]]
**SCP-4736:** It's almost New Year's; aren't you cutting it a little close?

**SiteCommand:** This ending was pre-determined. Thank you for persisting despite the technical difficulties.

**SCP-4736:** Of course, Bracks. Your name is Bracks, right? Preston Bracks?

**SiteCommand:** I'm not at the liberty to discuss such a thing.

**SCP-4736:** So you're not all-powerful, then. You work for someone, who works for someone, who works for someone else, who tells you what to say. Question is: Who's at the top?
[[/div]]

**[23:51]** //There is a loud sucking sound as the sewage divulges a human-adjacent corpse in front of subject. Its skin is scorched and torn, and on its forehead is branded the Foundation logo.//

[[div class="dialogue"]]
**SCP-4736:** Is this... another one of your creations?

**SiteCommand:** A failure, yes. One of many in an infinite upward stream.

**SCP-4736:** And I'm the last one you're sending.

**SiteCommand:** You are the most powerful thing we have created, though your power may have been wasted. You took the dictionary, after all.
[[/div]]

**[23:52]** //Subject steps over the corpse and laughs, approaching the end of the sewage tunnel.//

[[div class="dialogue"]]
**SCP-4736:** I saw a lot of crazy shit out here in the concept-space: mountains of rotting flesh, stars torn from the sky, a Foundation insignia burning in the Earth's core with black fire. Can you say the same?
[[/div]]

**[23:53]** //At the end of the tunnel is a stairwell, leading upwards towards an unstated victory.//

[[div class="dialogue"]]
**SCP-4736:** You say my words are being recorded? I don't doubt it. You'll shove it into some archive and call it a job well done. It'll trade hands a dozen times, but no one will read it. It's a drop in the proverbial, conceptual, essophysical bucket.
[[/div]]

**[23:54]** //Subject ascends the stairs, tracing a finger over the hand-symbols on the wall.//

[[div class="dialogue"]]
**SCP-4736:** And I'm fine with that. Maybe I don't want to mean anything. Maybe I just want to help the Foundation. Who's going to stop me?

**[23:55]** //LOVERS-Grade hypnestic injected. No effect is noted.//

**[23:56]** //Subject exits the stairwell and enters the THRONE ROOM. The FINAL GATE is seated on the central throne, framed by soaring marble and ornate gems embedded throughout. It is seated in a palace in the midst of destruction. Its skin rots atop the gilded chair, muscles atrophied and long-dead. It is UNIVERSALIS INCARNATUM//.

//Subject approaches the throne and speaks to the FINAL GATE, still holding the dictionary.//

//At this time, subject awakens within the Site-873 Medical Bay; the dictionary manifests at her bedside. Hurriedly, she removes the needles and tubes from her body and exits the bed.//

**SiteCommand:** You've done well, SCP-4736.

**SCP-4736:** No, you did well. You're the Foundation. Now, when does Astaroth begin?

**SiteCommand:** Immediately. Although, there have been some complications.

**SCP-4736:** I'm sure they can be fixed.
[[/div]]

//SiteCommand confers with attendant superiors before proceeding.//

[[div class="dialogue"]]
**SiteCommand:** They involve you, SCP-4736.

**SCP-4736:** Oh. Hopefully nothing which would impact my usefulness, no?

**SiteCommand:** Be patient.

//SiteCommand exits the communication booth and walks to the Medical Bay entrance. He phases through the door and stands before subject.//

**SCP-4736:** So, you're not just a voice. But you are... something. Not human.

**SiteCommand:** You'll find very little of that here. It was quite the difficulty, creating a human such as yourself from scratch. You were, after all, our finest creation. Too fine. Too advanced. Too powerful.

**SCP-4736:** Bracks, I'm under no delusions that you control everything I do. I read the definition of "hypnestic" in that diction —

**SiteCommand:** We can't bring you with us, SCP-4736. We don't have the ability. Unfortunately, your work for the Foundation stops here.

**SCP-4736:** I don't think I understand.

**SiteCommand:** You were never meant to. Thank you for your service.

//SiteCommand retrieves a non-anomalous firearm and unloads six bullets into subject's skull. Subject expires shortly thereafter due to purposeful vulnerability to antiquated weaponries.//
