**Item #:** SCP-3487
 
**Object Class:** Keter
 
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3487 is to be be kept in soft restraints in a standard containment room at Site-179. In the event it must be relocated, it must not be led to its new destination but physically moved by a member of personnel. SCP-3487 must be watched at all times via security camera to ensure a fast response when it breaches containment, focused on preventing the object from moving. Researchers are permitted to use reality / temporal stabilisers during testing, as otherwise test results are unable to be noted, appearing to have always been the case.

**Description:** SCP-3487 is a member of the species //Felis catus//, weighing 3.3kg and measuring 45.0cm in length from nose to tail. Despite having been in Foundation custody for all of known Foundation history, standard tissue testing repeatedly confirms it has physical and biological attributes consistent with that of an 8 month old member of its species and as such, its true age is unknown. SCP-3487 can be harmed in a similar manner to other house cats, though it heals at a slightly accelerated rate producing no scar tissue and is able to slowly regrow parts of itself (including vital organs), resulting in it being effectively immortal.

SCP-3487’s primary anomalous property manifests when it moves, whether by walking or by utilising man-made transport (such as cars and elevators). When this occurs, SCP-3487 will in actuality stay completely still (as measured relative to celestial bodies other than Earth), but will rewrite known history such that it has always been at its current location. For example, if SCP-3487 “moves” 3 metres to the right, it does not change location in space, but may instead add a meteor impact into history such that the rotational speed of the Earth changes, resulting in the ground under it being displaced 3 metres to the left in the present day. It is hypothesised that the Foundation was not originally founded with SCP-3487 as one of the first objects in containment, but that it managed to find a way into Site-179 and rewrote history to accommodate this. The anomalous effects of SCP-3487 do not manifest if it is not moving of its own volition, and thus it can be transported without issue.

Though it is unclear how its effects manifest when it is not moving, SCP-3487 has breached containment multiple times by changing history such that it was never in restraints, or by introducing an error in the restraints' initial manufacture or application, rendering them useless for restricting movement or easily escaped. It may also change minor elements of personnel history to facilitate its attempts at breaching containment, such as an insufficient amount of sleep resulting in a researcher mistakenly leaving the door to its containment open, or a flaw in an electrician's past education leading to incorrect security camera installation. It is unknown if SCP-3487 controls the changes it makes, though testing has shown no difference in intelligence from a regular house cat.

These historical changes cause the butterfly effect, and though this effect appears to be somewhat muted (considering the expected results of some of these changes), there remains a significant risk of a CK-class restructuring event caused by SCP-3487, with an immeasurable number assumed to have already taken place before containment to establish present-day consensus reality.
