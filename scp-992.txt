**Item** #: SCP-992

**Object Class**: Euclid/Keter 

**Special Containment Procedures**: Per the restraining orders, subject is to be kept at a maximum of 500ft from any and all personnel. If this containment is not observed, staff are instructed to cover their noses with their shirts until at a safe distance.

**Description**: SCP-992 was found in the dumpsters behind a Sonic restraunt at around 3am on a Tuesday eating the remains of a chili dog and raspberry slushie. Upon approaching the subject he emitted a flatulent burst that caused every window in every vehicle to shatter as well as set off every car alarm in the immediate vicinity.

The subject gives approximately ten seconds warning before releasing these bursts either by speaking in a random Native American language or by quoting lines from random movies starring Bruce Willis.

**Document #992-A**: [Dingos] On [DATA EXPUNGED] personnel noticed that several dingos were attempting to dig a tunnel to SCP-992's cell.  The dingos not digging were observed to be carrying Whoppers from a local Burger King. When chased away SCP-992 became enraged and farted. Dr. ██████ is now permanently blind and is unable to walk in a straight line without assistance.

**Document #992-B**: [White Castles] No.

**Document #992-C**: [Interruption] On [DATA EXPUNGED] of ███ A level 1 personnel, interrupted SCP-992's conversation with a eucalyptus tree. SCP-992 immediately ceased his conversation with the tree and glared at the personnel. When the level 1 personnel asked what SCP-992 was talking about the subject answered "I can never truly know, I was unable to paint the picture."  Several days later every Hardee's in town closed their doors to business.
