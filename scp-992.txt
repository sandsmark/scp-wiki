**Item #:** SCP-992

**Object Class:** Euclid/Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Subject is to be kept in a 10 m X 10 m X 3 m cell.  The cell must be equipped with a plexiglass/lucite composite roof 1 m thick to allow SCP-992 full view of natural weather conditions.  The walls of the cell must be steel-reinforced concrete no less than 3 m thick (see Document 992-A).  The floor of the cell must be natural soil and must be watered according to SPC-992’s wishes.  Any flora or fauna that SPC-992 requests should be brought into the cell as soon as possible and only removed at SPC-992’s request.  At no time is SCP-992 to lose contact with natural earth (that is, natural soil, dirt, or vegetation undeveloped by humans; see Document 992-B). Only natural light sources are to be used in SCP-992’s cell.  SCP-992 has been observed to converse with various forms of flora and fauna; personnel who disturb SCP-992 during these conversations are subject to immediate disciplinary action, up to and including termination (see Document 992-C).  Level 1 personnel may volunteer to interact with SCP-992, although if they elect to do so, they are never to interact with any other SCP of any designation at any time for fear that [DATA EXPUNGED].

**Description:** SCP-992 was found in [DATA EXPUNGED] near the [DATA EXPUNGED] in the central region of Australia.  SCP-992 appears to be an elderly Aboriginal male, but in the ██ years the subject has been contained, SCP-992 has not appeared to age. 

SCP-992 appears to have the ability to converse with or influence nature, though whether these abilities are prophetic in nature or due to the actions of SCP-992 has yet to be determined.  If SCP-992 is observed conversing with a natural entity and is asked what the conversation consisted of, SCP-992 generally alludes to some natural event which has yet to happen. SCP-992 converses freely with individuals who are granted access to his cell and often engages in philosophical discussions on the topic of nature.  Those who converse with SCP-992 often leave with "an expanded sense of self" and "great respect" for SCP-992.  There have been no adverse physiological or psychological side affects witnessed in subjects who have come in contact with SCP-992.

SCP-992 has predicted such natural disasters as [DATA EXPUNGED].  Since so far no evidence has been found to prove that SCP-992 caused these events, SCP-992 has been classified as Euclid. Observation and evaluation will continue, to attempt to determine the nature of SCP-992 and his abilities.

**Document 992-A (Dingoes):** On [DATA EXPUNGED], personnel noticed that several dingoes were attempting to dig a tunnel into SCP-992's cell. The dingoes were terminated before they could reach SCP-992. After the incident, SCP-992 displayed aggression to personnel, stating, "They only wanted to visit." Subsequently, [DATA EXPUNGED] occurred in the mountains of China, resulting in ████ deaths.  Because of this incident, the walls of SCP-992's cell were increased in thickness from 0.5 m to 3 m, and specimens of plant and animal life were allowed to be brought into SCP-992's cell.

**Document 992-B (Terrestrial Contact):** On [DATA EXPUNGED], several personnel attempted to relocate SCP-992 from point of contact via helicopter.  This action resulted in SCP-992's violent non-cooperation and resulted in a catastrophic [DATA EXPUNGED].  This was considered a coincidence until the full consequences of [DATA EXPUNGED] were established.  The containment of SCP-992 is the sole result of the subject allowing a containment facility to be built around him.

**Document 992-C (Interruption):** On [DATA EXPUNGED], a level 1 personnel interrupted SCP-992's conversation with a eucalyptus tree.  SCP-992 immediately ceased his conversation with the tree and glared at the personnel.  When the level 1 personnel asked what SCP-992 was talking about, SCP-992 answered, "I can never truly know, I was unable to paint the picture."  Several days later [DATA EXPUNGED].
