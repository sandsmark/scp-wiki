**Item** #: SCP-992

**Object Class**: Euclid/Keter 

**Special Containment Procedures**: Subject is to be kept in a 10m X 10m X 3m cell.  The cell must be equiped with a plexiglass/lucite composite roof 1m thick as to allow SPC-992 full view of natural weather contitions.  The walls of the cell must be a minimum of 3m steel reinforced concrete (See document 992-A).  The floor of the cell must be none other than natural soil and must be watered accordingly to SPC-992’s wishes.  Any flora or fauna which is requested by SPC-992 should be brought into the cell as soon as possible and only removed at SPC-992’s request.  At no time is SCP-992 to lose contact with the actual soil of the earth (See document 992-B). Only natural light sources are to be used in SCP-992’s cell.  SCP-992 has been observed to converse with various forms of flora and fauna, any attempt to disturb this action should be met with termination of the transgressor (See document 992-C).  Level 1 personnel may volunteer to interact with SCP-992 although if they elect to do so they are never to interact with any other SCP of any designation at any time for fear that [DATA EXPUNGED].

**Description**: SCP-992 was found in [DATA EXPUNGED] near the [DATA EXPUNGED] in the central region of Australia.  SCP-992 appears to be an elderly aboriginal male but in the ██ years the subject has been contained SCP-992 has not appeared to age.  
The subject appears to have the ability to converse with nature or influence nature, whether this is prophetic in nature or due to the actions of SCP-992 has yet to be determined.  If SCP-992 is seen conversing with some element of nature and is asked what the conversation consisted of SCP-992 generally alludes to some natural event which is yet to happen. SCP-992 converses freely with individuals who are granted access into his cell and often engages in philosophical discussion on the topic of nature.  Those who converse with SCP-992 often leave with "an expanded sense of self" and "great respect" for SCP-992.  There have been no adverse physiological or psychological side affects witnessed with subjects who have come in contact with SCP-992.

The subject has predicted such natural disasters as [DATA EXPUNGED], [DATA EXPUNGED], and [DATA EXPUNGED].  Until the true nature of SCP-992 is determined it is to be classified as Euclid/Keter.  Additional observation of SCP-992 and evaluation of the subjects divinations are required.

**Document #992-A**: [Dingos] On [DATA EXPUNGED] personnel noticed that several dingos were attempting to dig a tunnel to SCP-992's cell.  The wall at the time was .5m thick and, after the dingos were terminated, was increased to a thickness of 3m.  After the incident SCP-992 displayed aggression to personnel stating "they only wanted to visit" subsequently there was a [DATA EXPUNGED]in the mountains of China resulting in ████ deaths.  This incident resulted in the thickening of the containment walls as well as allowing various forms of plant and animal life to be brought into SCP-992's cell.

**Document #992-B**: [Terrestrial Removal] On [DATA EXPUNGED] several personnel attempted to relocate SCP-992 from point of contact via helicopter.  This action resulted in SCP-992's violent non-cooperation and resulted in a catastrophic [DATA EXPUNGED].  This was considered a coincidence until the full consequences of [DATA EXPUNGED] were established.  The containment of SCP-992 is the sole result of the subject allowing a containment facility to be built around him.

**Document #992-C**: [Interruption] On [DATA EXPUNGED] of ███ A level 1 personnel, interrupted SCP-992's conversation with a eucalyptus tree.  SCP-992 immediately ceased his conversation with the tree and glared at the personnel.  When the level 1 personnel asked what SCP-992 was talking about the subject answered "I can never truly know, I was unable to paint the picture."  Several days later [DATA EXPUNGED].
