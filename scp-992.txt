**Item** #: SCP-992

**Object Class**: Euclid/Keter 

**Special Containment Procedures**: Subject is to be kept in a 10m X 10m X 3m cell.  The cell must be equipped with a plexiglass/lucite composite roof 1m thick as to allow SCP-992 full view of natural weather conditions.  The walls of the cell must be a minimum of 3m steel reinforced concrete (See document 992-A).  The floor of the cell must be none other than natural soil and must be watered accordingly to SCP-992’s wishes.  Any flora or fauna which is requested by SCP-992 should be brought into the cell as soon as possible and only removed at SCP-992’s request.  At no time is SCP-992 to lose contact with the actual soil of the earth (See document 992-B). Only natural light sources are to be used in SCP-992’s cell.  SCP-992 has been observed to converse with various forms of flora and fauna, any attempt to disturb this action should be met with termination of the transgressor (See document 992-C).  Level 1 personnel may volunteer to interact with SCP-992 although if they elect to do so they are never to interact with any other SCP in the same time period for fear that [DATA EXPUNGED].

**Description**: SCP-992 was found in [DATA EXPUNGED] near the [DATA EXPUNGED] in the central region of Australia. SCP-992 appears to be an elderly aboriginal male but in the ██ years the subject has been contained SCP-992 has not appeared to age.  
The subject appears to have the ability to converse with nature or influence nature, whether this is due to the actions of SCP-992 or a prophetical ability has yet to be determined.  If SCP-992 is seen conversing with some element of nature and is asked what the conversation consisted of SCP-992 generally alludes to some natural event which is yet to happen. SCP-992 converses freely with individuals who are granted access into his cell and often engages in philosophical discussion on the topic of nature.  Those who converse with SCP-992 often leave with "an expanded sense of self" and "great respect" for SCP-992.  There have been no adverse physiological or psychological side affects witnessed with subjects who have come in contact with SCP-992.

The subject has predicted such natural disasters as [DATA EXPUNGED], [DATA EXPUNGED], and [DATA EXPUNGED].  Until the true nature of SCP-992 is determined it is to be classified as Euclid/Keter.  Additional observation of SCP-992 and evaluation of the subject's divination are required.

**Document #992-A**: [Dingos] On [DATA EXPUNGED] personnel noticed that several dingos were attempting to dig a tunnel to SCP-992's cell.  The wall at the time was .5m thick and, after the dingos were terminated, was increased to a thickness of 3m.  After the incident SCP-992 displayed aggression to personnel stating "they only wanted to visit" subsequently there was a [DATA EXPUNGED]in the mountains of China resulting in ████ deaths.  This incident resulted in the thickening of the containment walls as well as allowing various forms of plant and animal life to be brought into SCP-992's cell.

**Document #992-B**: [Terrestrial Removal] On [DATA EXPUNGED] several personnel attempted to relocate SCP-992 from point of contact via helicopter.  This action resulted in SCP-992's violent non-cooperation and resulted in a catastrophic [DATA EXPUNGED].  This was considered a coincidence until the full consequences of [DATA EXPUNGED] were established.  The containment of SCP-992 is the sole result of the subject allowing a containment facility to be built around him.

**Document #992-C**: [Interruption] On [DATA EXPUNGED] of ███ A level 1 personnel, interrupted SCP-992's conversation with an eucalyptus tree.  SCP-992 immediately ceased his conversation with the tree and glared at the personnel.  When the level 1 personnel asked what SCP-992 was talking about the subject answered "I can never truly know, I was unable to paint the picture." Several days later [DATA EXPUNGED].
