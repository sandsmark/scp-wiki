**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:**

**Description:**

**Addendum:**

++ **AS-OF-YET UNNAMED, DECOMMISSIONED SCP - RESPONSIBLE FOR DR. RIGHTS' INVOLVEMENT IN THE SCP FOUNDATION**

> Freaky-ass creatures (seen in my notes) that reproduce quickly and violently by using people's hollowed out bodies as shells for their young, and then gradually grow less and less human. Somewhere between those wasps that lay their eggs in other bugs, and spiders that bind their prey and suck them dry. Except for humans, 'stead of bugs. And very intelligent, powerful, and capable of some extreme acts of shapeshifting.

**Item #:** --SCP-XXX-- (No SCP number, perhaps? I'm not sure)

**Object Class:** Euclid/Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:**

**Description:**

**Addendum:**

++ **TERMINATION ORDER FOR THE ABOVE**

> Dr. Rights, as one of her first assignments, asks for the permission to terminate the last of them when it becomes too violent and unstable to risk keeping around, and nothing more can be learned from it. "There will always be other monster out there. But you're a special kind of fucked."
