title:Dr Rights' Draft Box
++ **HOLY SHIT MORE STUFF (>°-(>;_;)>**

    She woke up in pain at 6:30 that morning, and lay in bed for ten very long minutes, looking at the clock, watching as the little second counter beside the minutes ticked down 60 by 60. The pills were wearing off earlier and earlier, these days. She had considered weaning herself off of them, but the last time she had attempted that it had proven too much. She would've been able to do it, she could handle the pain on her own...but the dreams that came when she wasn't in the medically-induced, quiet, dreamless sleep...

    She couldn't handle that, not anymore. She just couldn't sleep through the nightmares like she had been able to do earlier in her life.

> A random researcher presenting his findings in the "Dr. Rights abilities case". Very subtle, very mindscrewy.

"This is Interveiw 90090595-AΔ, commenced by Dr. Geoff Naevius. If you could state your name for the record?"

"Dr. Agatha Rights. What's this all about? It hasn't been that long since my last investigation or interview or whatever they're calling this one."

"It's just a small interview. It'll only take about ten minutes or so, if we go through everything fast. And after that, you will be placed under temporary observation. Is that understood?"

"I didn't do it."

"I didn't accuse you of doing anything."

"Doesn't matter. I didn't do it."

"...Moving on."

> While I can safely say that I found no concrete evidence of the reality-warping abilities I was assigned to observe Dr. Rights for, I can't exactly say that I've disproved the theory that she possesses them. Dr. Rights was given no information as towards the reason for my observation, and was informed that I was investigating her for "various reasons". Of course, a look at her disciplinary record showed that she must be used to such reasons already. Needless to say, most of the duration of my observation was spent either being pampered by her, purposefully ignored by her, and even used when she was breaking protocol right under my nose.

"I can see from your personnel file that your fellow researchers describe you as a very interesting person."

"I'm not interesting, I'm just honest."

"That too. Oddly enough, the same people who commented upon you as being honest also have put you on the record as a thief, a liar, and a...to use a quote, 'conniving little mink'."

"Those too."

"No comments or anything?"

"Look, you can see from my records that I never tried to claim to be anything I wasn't, even when I was up against the termination board. No regrets. Well, a lot of regrets, but it's not like I can change what I've already done."

"What if you could?"

"What would the point be? Things have worked out relatively fine to this point."

"Are you saying that there's nothing wrong with your life?"

"I'm saying that there's no crime in being content."

> One of the things I was instructed to do, albeit with much caution, in order to observe reactions was to provoke. While attempting to spur a reality-bender into action could have disastrous consequences, I was assured that they had a backup plan in a worst case scenario. From what I've gathered, this involved simply asking everybody who she worked with that, if given the order, they would do the honor of terminating her on the spot.

//Kondraki, being informed of this duty by O5-4, took a second to think, before answering.//

"How, when, and where?"

//Kondraki later expressed no recollection of this order.//

"Can you tell me what you were like as a kid?"

"I guess so. I actually don't have a lot of memories from being a kid."

"Elaborate, please."

"I really can only think of a few striking moments which really stood out. Otherwise I guess I just didn't care enough to remember anything solidly. It's all just a big jumble of classmates and playing in the woods and all the dumb shit I'd get myself into. I was a pretty stupid kid. I mean, from my parents standpoint I was too smart for my own good, but that honestly just circles back around to being a dumbass."

"You sound a little critical of yourself."

"I was a stupid, hyperactive kid who did nothing but get into fights all the time. If I could go back in time and give my little self a whupping I would. Although I'd be afraid of her biting my damn fingers off. I was very violent. Oddly enough, I don't really remember those parts, but whatever. I was just very...temperamental and hostile."

"You don't really seem like the temperamental type. While there are a few records of fights, more often than not you have stated that you're not actually intending to cause damage, or you're acting in self-defense."

"If I really wanted to hurt people, they'd be dead right now."

> What was supposed to be a ten-minute interview lasted only five, and she spent the remainder of the day baking cookies and generally expressing annoyance towards me. By the next day, she seemed to be completely at-ease with my presence, and went about her usual business, even allowing for me to observe [[[SCP-542]]] with her as he replaced one of his twin hearts. I observed that, when calm, she would talk about anything she was prompted to discuss, even when subjects would make most people uncomfortable or insulted.

> Freaky-ass creatures (seen in my notes) that reproduce quickly and violently by using people's hollowed out bodies as shells for their young, and then gradually grow less and less human. Somewhere between those wasps that lay their eggs in other bugs, and spiders that bind their prey and suck them dry. Except for humans, 'stead of bugs. And very intelligent, powerful, and capable of some extreme acts of shapeshifting.

++ **TERMINATION ORDER FOR THE ABOVE**

> Dr. Rights, as one of her first assignments, asks for the permission to terminate the last of them when it becomes too violent and unstable to risk keeping around, and nothing more can be learned from it. "There will always be other monster out there. But you're a special kind of fucked."
