**Dr. Snorlison**

----------------

**Euclid-class theoretical researcher.**

**Security Class:** Level-█. Not allowed to have direct contact with any SCP object.

**Duties:** Experiment Design, Contingency Planning, Theoretical SCP Studies.

**History:** Dr. Snorlison was hired by the Overseers to provide a fresh perspective to the Foundation's work. His duties are to review the many and various SCP files and look for opportunities for research that have heretofore been neglected.

> O5-██: "He's here to poke sticks at random SCPs, and see what happens."

As a part of this protocol, Dr. Snorlison is to have no contact with any of SCP object. His purpose is to remain at a remove from the research subjects so that he may better perceive "the big picture". It has been determined that a personal encounter with any SCP object may risk diminishing the detachment required for Dr. Snorlison's duties.

Dr. Snorlison spends most of his time in the various SCP libraries, reading as much as he can of the collected data under the Foundation umbrella. His office space has been assigned in Research Sector-15.

--------------

**Support Documents:**

Please see Document ███████ as it pertains to the ██████ Incident and Dr. Snorlison's efforts to contain the [DATA EXPUNGED] even as many subsystems were left in disarray, infected with [DATA EXPUNGED], a veritable assault of sensation that left many [DATA EXPUNGED] too horrible to speak of.

Dr. Snorlison's efforts were able to restore much of the SCP main server, and provided critical information to Mobile Task Force Delta-5 among others. Appropriate commendatory response is being determined. He has requested a statue and a sandwich menu item.

Dr. Snorlison was placed in a temporary 30-day quarantine to watch for the expression of any memetic diseases he may have been exposed to from the ██████ Entity.

**Disciplinary review interview excerpt:**

**O5-██:** So, you do not feel you've lost your scientific detachment?

**Dr. Snorlison:** No, I have not lost my scientific detachment.

**O5-██:** Some of the Overseers believe that you have allowed yourself to grow attached to some of the SCP objects, and have been making requests on their behalf.

**Dr. Snorlison:** I make requests on behalf of the Foundation, to further our interests and to obtain more knowledge of the SCPs. We are holding many of these SCPs de facto hostage, with no access to their family and psychological support networks. Despite how different they are, they still have normal human psychologies for the most part. Look at the lackluster efforts of SCP-███ to provide information about ██████████-██████████ ██████ SCPs. Look at the recent escape of [[[SCP-105]]].

We are not to make the SCPs comfortable, nor are we to make them content with their lives. Our goals should be to foster within them a desire to strive to please the Foundation and its representatives. This requires application of both positive as well as negative stimulus.

We can't push them around and expect them to respond appropriately. We need to pull the strings. We need to learn that every human can be pushed to make the decisions we need and take the actions we dictate — we just need to find the right ribbon for the package, so to speak.

I'm trying to make them a more effective resource for us.

**O5-██:** If that is the case, what in the long term do you see as the result of the effective management of SCP personnel?

**Dr. Snorlison:** I see a future where SCPs walk up to our doors and hope for a chance to turn themselves over to us. I see a future where every child dreams of being an SCP.

I see a future where we've harnessed their inherent preternatural power the way we harnessed the electron and the atom.

It would be glorious.

-------------

**ADMINISTRATIVE NOTE:** Well I think, while we can consider Snorlison an adequate researcher, it's well within the realm of accurate to say that our little experiment failed. There are numerous documented encounters of Dr. Snorlison with SCP or SCP-class objects. Also, there's that disturbing computer bug that emerged after the HAGGER incident which has centered on him. Frankly, I think we should return him to the status of normal researcher and limit his access to our databases.

For fun, let's send him up north to play with the Ghosties. His last research interest, before he disappeared in the mechanocomputer for a month, was in that Shattered Girl, so let's give him more ectoplasm to play with.

Remind him to pack for cold weather.

**OVERSEERS NOTE:** //Researchers come and go, but the procedures remain the same. Don't become too attached. Be seeing you.//
