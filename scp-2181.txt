**Item #:** SCP-2181

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2181 is kept in a standard Humanoid containment cell at Site-81. Monitoring is to be done by closed-circuit camera only; cell should not have windows. Cell door is to be furnished with an external manual, non-electronic lock in addition to standard site-wide remote electronic locking mechanisms. The door is to remain closed and locked while personnel are within the cell. Should SCP-2181 lock the door to its containment cell, personnel are to wait fifteen minutes before manually disengaging the lock and reengaging remotely. SCP-2181 is to be supplied with a misting bottle of saline fluid that should be refilled every two days. Requests for food, music and toys are to be brought to the Site Director for approval.

**Addendum:** After Event 2181-02, personnel within the containment cell are to remain at least 5 meters from locked doors in the event that SCP-2181 becomes distressed.

**Description:** SCP-2181 is a small humanoid of indeterminate gender with semi-opaque skin, appearing approximately seven years of age.[[footnote]]SCP-2181 has not aged visibly while in containment. It does not require physical sustenance, though it often makes requests for baked sweets.[[/footnote]] The orbits of the eyes are 11.5 cm in diameter,[[footnote]]Nearly five times standard for a seven year old human.[[/footnote]] with accompanying deformities to the frontal, parietal and zygomatic bones of the cranium. Despite the pupil being six times larger than normal, the irises are of standard width. The eyelids are also of standard size, making them disproportionately small, and SCP-2181 suffers from dry eyes. SCP-2181 has considerably greater visual acuity and range than a normal human.

Testing has revealed that SCP-2181 can close and lock any door within sight, as well as windows, hatches, and any other covering placed in a wall, ceiling or floor. SCP-2181 is not capable of opening doors at a distance. Its behavior when left alone is considered normal for an introverted seven year old child.[[footnote]]SCP-2181's psychological profile suggests post-traumatic stress, likely due to prior emotional abuse.[[/footnote]] SCP-2181 will close and lock doors seemingly at random and react with extreme distress if not allowed or able to do so. SCP-2181's introversion has increased since Event 2181-02.

SCP-2181 was contained on March 1, 1976, when it exited Site-81's third floor men's lavatory, closing and locking the door behind itself.[[footnote]]The lavatory door was not equipped with a lock.[[/footnote]] SCP-2181 asked to be hidden from a malevolent entity or force, details of which have not been provided to date. The lavatory wall had to be manually breached to affect rescue of two personnel locked within.

**Addendum: Log of Event 2181-02**
> //**Preface:** Dr. Amelia Wygandt, head researcher for SCP-2181, had served as SCP-2181's psychologist for the past four years, in the hope of reducing its introversion and gaining information about its origin.//
> 
> **Time stamp: 16:52, ██/█/1980**
> 
> **00:00:** Dr. Wygandt brings the session to a close and directs SCP-2181 in cleaning up building block toys. Containment cell door is closed, per regulations.
> 
> **00:22:** Dr. Wygandt asks SCP-2181 if it wishes to talk about where it came from. SCP-2181 shakes head and does not answer. Dr. Wygandt asks if it will describe how it reached Site-81. SCP-2181 responds that it "walked in" because it "knew it would be safe." Further questions are ignored, and object continues silently gathering blocks.
> 
> **01:07:** SCP-2181 cries out in alarm, turning to cell door. Remote electromagnetic locking mechanism engages.
> 
> **01:15:** Dr. Wygandt moves to door and discovers it is locked. SCP-2181 is informed that future "play dates" will be jeopardized if she cannot leave the containment cell.
> 
> **01:31:** SCP-2181 places a finger against its lips and says, "She'll be home soon." Site staff reports containment cell door lock override unresponsive. Dr. Wygandt continues attempts to open door and entreaties SCP-2181 to unlock it.
> 
> **01:57:** Containment cell door opens. A hand, approximately 2 m high, covered in unidentifiable crystal formations, emerges from inside containment cell airlock, grasps Dr. Wygandt and draws her through door. Personnel mobilized outside containment cell report doorway is obscured by view of deep space; command advises team should not engage. SCP-2181 screams. Containment cell door slams shut.
> 
> **16:40:** Remote lock override engages. Personnel examine cell and find no sign of Dr. Wygandt. SCP-2181 is curled in fetal position in corner furthest from door, crying.
> 
> //**Endnote:** SCP-2181 was unresponsive until moved to new containment cell, at which time it locked the door and would not allow remote override for a period of 255 hours. Containment procedures were updated. When asked about the incident, SCP-2181 refused to provide any information about the entity or the whereabouts of Dr. Wygandt.//

**Addendum: Log of Event 2181-04**
> On 6/12/2005, Site-81 experienced a power failure and site-wide containment breach. (See Document 81-CB-20051206.) SCP-2181 did not leave its cell during this time. After containment was reestablished, routine containment checks revealed SCP-2181 playing with a small artifact made of crudely interlocking bones. Artifact was recovered and classified as Anomalous Item 2181-01.  Bones did not conform to any known shape; testing revealed them to be a conglomeration of human DNA with cetacean and a third unknown species. Human DNA did not match any individual on file. Bones were inscribed with a series of lines that, when transcribed as binary code, translate as follows:
> 
>> //once upon a time//
>> //there was a little prince//
>> //who wandered where he shouldn't//
>> //and saw a thing he shouldn't//
>> //he tried to run a way//
>> //and close the door behind//
>> //that silly little prince//
>> //it's not like he can hide//
> 
> When questioned about the item, SCP-2181 said, "Amelia sends her love." Examination of security footage did not reveal how SCP-2181 procured the item.
