title:Keter
The designation "Keter" is assigned to subjects that either display active hostility to human life, civilization, and/or the space/time continuum, or are capable of causing significant destrucion upon their use. Such subjects must be cataloged, contained according to special containment procedures, and destroyed, if possible.

"Keter" means "crown" in Hebrew, and is the uppermost level of the Sephirot in Jewish Kabbalah.

The Organization has harnessed some Keter-class SCPs, but such situation are rare exceptions; for example, SCP-076 only agreed to work us due to his unusual relationship with Agent [REDACTED], and his ability to communicate with us. The majority of Keter-class SCPs are insentient, and most are inanimate objects. This status may change as research and discovery continues.
