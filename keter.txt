||||Label for SCP objects designated to the "Keter" classification  ||
[[/div]]

The designation "Keter" is assigned to subjects that either display active hostility to human life, civilization, and/or the space/time continuum, or are capable of causing significant destruction upon their use. Such subjects must be cataloged, contained according to special containment procedures, and destroyed, if possible.

Merely being inimical to human life is not in itself cause for classification as a Keter-level object. A Keter classification indicates that not only is this subject capable of inflicting harm to human life and civilization, but that containment protocols must be extensive and involved in order to prevent it from doing so. If destruction is not a top priority for a Keter-class SCP, it is because it has been demonstrated that the object has significant tactical value for the Foundation, that destruction of the object could potentially cause more harm than its continued existence, or destruction of the object is unfeasible at this time (due to apparent invulnerability or similar circumstance.)

"Keter" means "crown" in Hebrew, and is the uppermost level of the Sephirot in Jewish Kabbalah.

The Organization has harnessed some Keter-class SCPs, but such situation are rare exceptions; for example, SCP-076 only agreed to work with us due to his unusual relationship with Agent [REDACTED], and his ability to communicate with us. The majority of Keter-class SCPs are insentient, and most are inanimate objects. This status may change as research and discovery continues.
