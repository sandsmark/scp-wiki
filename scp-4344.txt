**Item #:** SCP-4344

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4344 currently requires no direct containment. Satellite images of SCP-4344 are to be altered appropriately. Should SCP-4344 closely approach another asteroid, astronomical assets are to enact suitable disinformation procedures.

**Description:** SCP-4344 is a metallic spacecraft constructed from a large, hollowed-out asteroid, currently orbiting in the asteroid belt.

SCP-4344 is approximately 4.9 km long, and 2.8 km wide, and is mainly composed of an iridium-iron skeleton with a coating of living, armored reptilian skin 4m thick, seamlessly bonded to the metal. Radiometric dating of the metal gives an estimated age of 64±2 million years. 

The front of SCP-4344 is sculpted to resemble a large tyrannosaur head, with tubes protruding from the eyes. The rear of SCP-4344 houses a single, large thruster, while smaller thrusters line all sides. These thrusters are connected to an empty spherical chamber in the center of SCP-4344. 

Exploration of SCP-4344 via unmanned probe reveals that it possesses two airlocks, and normally maintains an internal atmosphere of 70% nitrogen, 28% oxygen, and 2% assorted gases, mostly argon and carbon dioxide. 

The bridge of SCP-4344 consists of approximately 4 km^^2^^ of floor space spread among three decks, each with a series of control mechanisms. A crystalline sphere hovers above a stone dais in the bow of the ship, emitting a holographic display of SCP-4344's interior, status, and surroundings. A large, oblong stone slab is affixed to the dais, and displays a series of 10 symbols in luminescent red, assumed to be numerals.

The lowest level of SCP-4344 serves as a hangar for several types of small, black stone single-passenger spacecraft. These spacecraft are shaped to resemble pterosaurs, with squat cockpits, large thin wings, and a decorative head. Ranged plasma weapons and assorted missiles line the sides of the craft. Each type is sized for a different species of SCP-4344-1. Only 27 spacecraft are in the hangar, while the hangar holds marked spaces for up to 1,190.

SCP-4344 contains over 9,500 occupants throughout its interior, designated SCP-4344-1. All SCP-4344-1 instances are nearly identical to various Late Cretaceous dinosaurs, including //Pachycephalosaurus//, //Triceratops//, //Ankylosaurus//, //Titanosaurus//, and //Tyrannosaurus rex//[[footnote]]No instances [[[scp-4041|possess feathers]]].[[/footnote]] with the exception of more dextrous hands and forelimbs. 529 of these are corpses located on SCP-4344's main bridge; analysis suggests asphyxiation as the cause of death due to a damaged ventilation system. 

Remaining SCP-4344-1 are in individual glass-and-bronze pods filled with a translucent yellow resin, kept alive in suspended animation. A slab of smooth black stone affixed to each pod displays several swirling lines and symbols in glowing magenta. 

Large murals exist throughout SCP-4344, created from colored, luminescent gemstones.

||~ Number||~ Location||~ Description||
||002||Center of living quarters||The Earth, as viewed from space. Continental positions consistent with Late Cretaceous.||
||014||Bridge||Stylized image of two theropod dinosaurs, one black and one blue, raising swords.||
||021||Engine room||Half depicts the Earth, with a ball of fire approaching it. The other half depicts several ankylosaurs surrounding a sigil.||
||029||Near a weapon turret||A //Thescelosaurus// standing atop the ball of fire and impaling it with an oversized sword.||
||032||Central hall||SCP-4344 departing Earth. A pachycephalosaurid is seen holding tools and waving.||
||035||Hangar||A red circle, with a turtle-like [[[scp-1565|silhouette]]] overlaid on it.||
||040||Bridge||SCP-4344 facing a large, moon-like object with a face. Both the moon's and SCP-4344's sculpted faces are visibly hostile.||
||041||Bridge||A large explosion, shattering the moon object into many fragments.||

**Addendum 4344-02:** On 04/28/2023, SCP-4344 drifted towards another asteroid, 951 Gaspra. Cameras placed on SCP-4344 showed several auxiliary systems reactivating, and the thruster core chamber ignited, forming what appeared to be a miniature star inside it.

SCP-4344 accelerated towards 951 Gaspra, and fired several harpoon-like devices from its front, ensnaring the asteroid. SCP-4344 then opened fire with plasma artillery batteries located on its surface, before opening its mouth to ingest the remaining fragments of the asteroid.

Once 951 Gaspra was annihilated, SCP-4344 used its auxiliary thrusters to readjust its orientation, then emitted a large burst from its main thruster. Foundation orbital calculations predict SCP-4344 will intersect the orbit of 1 Ceres within 18 months. 

During the attack and subsequent maneuvering, several dozen of the preserved SCP-4344-1 instances twitched or jerked in their pods. On the bridge, the last red symbol on the black stone slab changed.
