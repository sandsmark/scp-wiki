**Item #:** SCP-X

**Object Class:** --Safe-- Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-X is to be kept inside its original containment barrels at all times. All recovered barrels, including empty ones, are stored in a standard Safe-level containment chamber at Site-24. Any personnel exposed directly to SCP-X are to be reviewed by the on-site medical team.

SCP-X-A is to be contained according to standard Foundation anomalous radio and television broadcasts suppression protocols (see document Protocol-22-Romeo). Any change in SCP-X-A's behavior is to be transcribed and immediately brought to the current Site Overseer's attention.

Regular Foundation raids are to be conducted in all known water-treatment facilities throughout --countries of the former Soviet bloc-- the United States of America, Canada, Russian Federation, Ukraine and the Republic of Belarus.

**Description:** SCP-X is a clear, colorless, tasteless and odorless liquid of unknown chemical composition. SCP-X strongly resembles ordinary water in its properties, with the exception of being far denser (by 57.6%) and possessing the ability to conduct electricity even in near-pure form. The origin of these two abnormalities is unknown, although several experiments conducted by Dr. J██████ between 2005/07/██ and 2005/11/██ seem to suggest [DATA EXPUNGED]. Further research into SCP-X's physical and/or chemical properties is suspended until further notice.

All recorded instances of SCP-X to date have been found insides standard, 55-gallon (208.7 liter), liquid-storage blue plastic barrels. Recovered barrels show signs of light to medium wear. The drums themselves do not appear to possess any anomalous qualities. Barrels containing SCP-X are almost exclusively found insides water or sewage treatment facilities, such as pumps, wells, water towers, dams, etc. The drums come in groups of one to seven, and usually all are full of SCP-X.

When consumed by a human being (or certain great apes - see Test Log X-01), SCP-X's effects will manifest in 5 to 24 hours. Following consumption of SCP-X, the person who drank the liquid (henceforth: "the subject") will attempt to locate a functional radio device, often periodically asking his surroundings for one if not capable of acquiring such a device on their own. Subject will never become violent or perform any action they deem immoral or socially unacceptable while trying to locate a device, although if denied access to a radio device for a large period of time (over 6 months) subjects often become desperate, threatening and pleading others or attempting to assemble their own home-made devices.

Subjects will be affected by SCP-X even if found in extremely low concentrations. SCP-X has shown to affect subjects when 3 milliliters of the substance were mixed with over 1200 liters of water.

Once in possession of a functional radio device, subject will attempt to locate and listen to SCP-X-A. Subject will do this subtly, usually only briefly pausing on SCP-X-A's frequency when turning the dial or browsing between different stations. In almost all cases subject is completely unaware of their actions and will not remember stopping to listen to SCP-X-A. If subject does remember doing so, they will excuse their behavior by claiming to have heard "something interesting" or a favorable song when going over SCP-X-A. Most subjects perform this act on a bi-weekly basis.

SCP-X-A is an anomalous radio station broadcasting on the frequencies of ███.█kHz, ███.█kHz and ████.█kHz. SCP-X-A is accessible by most common radio devices, and therefor is to be considered a Class E information breach hazard. The Foundation's efforts to jam or suppress SCP-X-A's signal have only resulted in limited success. Testing has shown that subjects affected by SCP-X are able to locate and receive SCP-X-A despite the Foundation's efforts to block  their access to SCP-X-A. SCP-X-A can be received --throughout East Europe-- south-western Russia, the United States, and several isolated locations in Canada. All attempts to locate SCP-X-A's --source-- sources have failed.

SCP-X-A is silent the vast majority of the time. On regular intervals (once in exactly 4 hours and 20 minutes) the silence is broken and a female voice speaking in English can be heard. Voice has been described as belonging to a 30-year-old woman with a light Slavic accent. Phrases broadcast by SCP-X-A are almost always short and abrupt. The most common phrase broadcast by SCP-X-A is "Await further instructions". Despite being monitored by the Foundation for over ██ years, there have been less than 100 recorded cases of SCP-X-A broadcasting anything other than "Await further instructions" (See document X-A-04).

Open letter to O5-█, written by Head Researcher K██████ and attached to monthly site report sent on ██/██/2009:

> Over the past three years our recovery team has located no less than ██ barrels of SCP-X, ██ of which were found empty, and █ were found only partly-full. In total, we're dealing here with over ████ liters of missing liquid. That's a worrying trend, especially when considering the locations SCP-X is usually found in. Me and my team have been analyzing the tap-water supply of █ settlements located near SCP-X recovery sites, [DATA EXPUNGED].
> This lead me and my colleagues to believe we have a [DATA EXPUNGED] on our hands here.
> I have submitted a formal request (attached to this letter) to upgrade SCP-X to Euclid status, and revise our current containment procedures. In addition, I'd like to personally request [REDACTED] allocated funding.

> To Secure, to Contain, to Protect
> -Dr. K██████, Site-24

O5-█: Request to upgrade SCP-X to Euclid denied. Request to revise SCP-X's containment procedures denied; SCP-X's containment procedures are to be reviewed nonetheless. Request to provide additional funding for Project █████ ███ █████ denied.
