List of works found within [[[SCP-1326]]], listed under their corresponding index numbers. Index numbers are inputted by rotating the dials on SCP-1326's cover to the desired values, pressing down on the dials until they click to register the change in position, then inserting SCP-1326-1 into its keyhole and unlocking SCP-1326. The circular and hemispherical dials are numbered 1-360 and A-G, respectively, with each combination of number and letter corresponding to different content. Inserting multiple consecutive combinations of values has been found to yield different results than those yielded by the individual combinations, and inputted values will continue to "stack" until SCP-XXXX is opened. Due to the mass quantities of potential combinations, this document is considered incomplete and will be updated as new combinations are tested and their results recorded.

**Index #:** 45-E-45-G
**Contents:** //The Secret Lives of Centipede Nymphs//, author unknown
**Notes:** Documentary of the culture and religion of beings resembling SCP-562 in their native habitat. Accessed by accident after inputting the incorrect index for Dr. ██████'s notes, then inputting the correct index without opening SCP-1326. Inputting multiple index combinations into SCP-1326 found to yield different results than inputting either single combination.
