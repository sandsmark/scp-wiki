title:Senior Staff Shenanigans
Dr. Bright sat in the middle of the Cafeteria, the old fashioned computer set before him. Atop said computer was a certain statue of a certain monkey, which many people had tried to obtain.

I currently hold it, so y'all can start by pranking me... May god have mercy on all our souls."
