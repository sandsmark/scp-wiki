title:Senior Staff Shenanigans
Dr. Bright sat in the middle of the Cafeteria, the old fashioned computer set before him. Atop said computer was a certain statue of a certain monkey, which many people had tried to obtain. Around him stood, sat, or otherwise existed quite a large number of the junior staff, with a few seniors, all eyes glued to the good doctor.

"And...save. There we go. The entirety of site 19, backed up, and emailed elsewhere, so if this goes as balls up as I expect it to, we can reboot." He sighed, and stood up. "In that case, I officially declare the beginning of the Staff Prank war of 2011. Whoever holds 050 at the end of a 24 hour period will be promoted to the ranks of Senior Staff. I currently hold it, so y'all can start by pranking me... May god have mercy on all our souls."

...And then the bomb under his chair detonated, covering the cafeteria with lime green paint, and incidentally blowing his legs off in the process. Several rooms away, research assistant Renfield took her fingers out of her ears and looked happily down at the monkey statue now gracing her new desk.

------

Dmitri studied his reflection for a moment, adjusted the angle of his hat, then exited his quarters. The heel irons in his boots clicked on the linoleum floors as he walked briskly through the halls of Site 19. Those going about their daily business knew to stay out of the way when Strelnikov was about; his movements had purpose, and that could only mean a disaster was looming.

Indeed it was. Renfield's office was only two floors down from his own.

Before he even knew it, he was reading the nametag on her door. Or rather, he was reading her name amongst a list of other assistants who shared this office. As he kicked the door off its hinges, he decided it didn't really matter whose office it was. His boots left dents in the sheet metal as he stepped over the broken door and surveyed the group of cowering interns, hand resting casually on his holster.

"Which ones of you is Rend Field."  No answer.

"I WILL SHOOT ONE OF YOU EVERY MINUTE UNTIL I AM TOLD WHICH ONES OF YOU IS REND FIELD." The group parted like the Red Sea, leaving a smug looking young girl standing alone in the center. Dmitri's teeth shone as he growled at her.

**TWO HOURS LATER**

"SON OF THE BITCH, JACK. GOD DAMMIT."

"Dmitri, you can't just shoot whoever is holding the monkey and expect to get it. That isn't a prank." Bright's wheelchair bumped into the back of Dmitri's leg as he manhandled it around. "And get out of the damn way."

Dmitri jabbed a finger at Bright. "IT IS A PRANK. I HAVE DONE THIS PRANK SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE, IN BOTH WARS."

"It's not a prank, Dmitri."

"YES IT IS!"

"Dmitri. It's over. You're out of the competition now, for good. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go deal with Renfield in the infirmary....smug little bitch. You could have at least killed her."

Strelnikov sighed heavily and returned to the quiet of his quarters, trying to reconcile himself to the fact that 050 would never be his.

-----

Agent Lament whistled quietly to himself, glancing down at his watch, nodding amiably to the nurse as she walked into Renfield's room carrying an IV bag of saline.  Lament smirked slightly and started walking down the hallway, heading toward his extremely messy office and waiting outside the door.

-----

Renfield moaned in her sleep, the drugs having her knocked out completely. The nurse hooked up the IV bag, checked the prone woman's vitals, and left the room.  Within three minutes Renfield's skin started to develop large, round hives, then her neck and throat started to swell as a severe allergic reaction set in, followed by her eyes shooting open as the stimulants hit her bloodstream.  She tried to scream but couldn't, her throat beginning to close as she desperately hit the call button again and again and again...

----

Lament opened his door, looking into his office and smiling slightly at the statue. Now... How the hell could he get rid of it before someone noticed that he had it?

----

Few people had a true appreciation for just how ingrained computers were with every single aspect of modern society, and the Foundation was no exception. Despite all the hard copies, every report, every researcher's note, every field log and every file photo was logged into a computer database somewhere. Every personnel transfer, every requisition form, every security feed, all set up in little 0's and 1's on a hard drive somewhere. When the transfer of Site 19's backup set off some alarms, he knew it was time. Kap - a name adopted because he was sick of people mispronouncing his full name - was sitting and typing away deep in the bowels of the Site. The coders and hardware gurus had a whole, unique set of regulations and security clearances, and the amount of information you were exposed to above your classification level was directly proportional to your time on the job. The guys that ran the networks and made sure the workstations functioned knew more than most of the researchers, though maybe not as much as that one janitor.

Once he realized that a mixed batch of saline and known allergens could only be used for the ever-escalating prank contests, a few key strokes were all it took to set retaliation in motion. A series of embedded programs ticked off other protocols which activated further batch processes. The sheer array of false IPs and bogus addresses would take the average user months to back-trace, and any of the other computer staff were already well-bribed with beer, pizza, and the promise of a neat and orderly work area. Lament opened the door to his office, seeing a single, solitary box laying there, carefully gift-wrapped and tied with a neat bow. It wasn't even close to his birthday, but there was no way any sort of bomb or other device could have made it that deep into a secure Foundation site, so he took it inside and opened it up.

Kap was as surprised as anyone when the little monkey appeared on top of his computer tower, and sighed slightly at the poor devil who was going to have to treat Lament and clean up the hundreds of tiny insects from his office. After all, the present was bees.

Dr. Los E. R. checked the sign again.  Eisenberg's office was room...321?  No, wait, 312.  He set off at a brisk pace down the hallway, hoping to get there before anyone else did.

309, 310, 311...There we go, 312.  Los E. R. gave a quick knock and pushed the door open without waiting for a reply.  Researcher Eisenberg visibly balked at the sudden intrusion, his eyes darting to the statue on his desk before reaching for the top drawer. 

"Whoa whoa whoa!  Calm down, I'm not going to do anything!"  Los E. R. held his palms out.  "See?  Sorry, didn't think you'd be so jumpy."

Eisenberg stopped, eyeing the doctor warily, but kept his hand resting on the top drawer.  "What do you want?"

"Word around the site is that you got 1006 to net Kap.  Just wanted to say, that's brilliant!  No one ever expects nets!"  Los E. R. chuckled to himself.  "Oh, don't worry about me.  I'm not going to pull some horrendous prank.  I'd probably end up in the hospital, I've never been really good at elaborate pranks."

Eisenberg seemed to relax slightly at Los E. R.'s reassurance, but wasn't totally swayed.  "No, it wasn't nets, exactly...I had them tattoo Lenin on him."

Los E. R. burst out laughing, leaning on the desk for support.  "You had them //tattoo// a portrait of //Lenin?!//  That's genius!  How does someone come up with something like that?!  Oh man, I'd never pull something like that off, I'm no good with those elaborate pranks.  Did you actually talk to those little commies yourself?"

Eisenberg smiled and chuckled nervously.  "Yeah, it wasn't too hard to get them to agree.  I mean, it //was// Lenin after all.  Talking to a bunch of spiders though...that was kinda creepy.  They were all over the place."

"I can tell.  You've got a cobweb on your coat, here let me..."  Los E. R. reached forward and scratched at Eisenbergs lapel.  On instinct, he glanced down to catch a glimpse of the bit of silk wafting from his collar, only to get a flick on the nose. 

"Gotcha."

Stunned, he watched as Los E. R. laughed one more time before he scooped SCP-050 from his desk and exited the room.  As he disappeared around the door frame, Eisenberg heard him chuckle.  

"Never was any good with those elaborate pranks."

-----
"Hey, Los."

Los E. R. felt a chill run down his spine at the voice. "Oh no," he whimpered. "Not HIM. . ."

He turned around, clutching the monkey statue to his chest, as a breathtakingly ugly middle-aged man walked down the hall towards him. "Relax," Clef said. "I don't want that statue. I'm already senior staff, and I have no interest in Bright's games. You're safe from me."

Los E. R. sighed in relief. "Oh, thank god," he said. "I really did not want to be subject to a prank by you."

"Hey, don't worry about it. I'm beyond that sort of bullshit anyway. I always thought that stuff was kinda stupid. In fact, as a sign of my goodwill, I'll escort you back to your office."

Los E. R. quickly followed Clef down the hallway. It was amazing, he thought, what the presence of that man could do. A researcher leaped out from around the corner holding a giant creme pie, which he rapidly put down and walked away from. A man wearing a hockey mask and holding a machete took off his costume and had a sheepish talk with the Senior Researcher. It was wonderful. 

"Well, here we are," Clef said. 

Los E. R. looked up at the door and frowned. "This isn't my office," he said. 

"What? Oh, oops.  Sorry. 571, not 517. Let's go."

Clef led the junior staff member to the other side of the floor, and to his office. "Well, here we are. . . again," he said, a few minutes later.

"Thanks a lot, Dr. Clef," Los E. R. said. "I really appreciate it."

"No problem. Oh, Los? Remember when I said I had no interest in Bright's games?" Clef grinned, a huge, evil, sinister grin. "I lied."

That was when the door of Los' office exploded outward, and five thousand gallons of compressed shaving cream flooded the hallway.

Clef watched Los being carried away in the avalanche of white foam, and wiped a little spot off his jacket. "Go get em', Adams," he murmured.

Ed from Accounting (everyone thought of him as "Ed from Accounting" -- including himself after 14 years at the job) hated the prank wars.  A waste of staff time, the building maintenance budget, and the cost of injuries, if you asked him...which no one did.  The usual threats -- paperwork, budget cuts, audits -- never seemed to work.  More creative means were called for.

Ed called Junior Researcher Johnson.  "Is it ready? ... really? Good! Bring it around to my office."

Fifteen minutes later, Johnson was in Ed's dingy, cluttered office, handing him a small brown bag.  Ed looked in the bag and smiled.  "How long will it stay that way?"

"Weeks" Johnson replied.  "at least, if no one touches it."

Ed put the bag in his briefcase, along with a small stack of papers.  12:20? Good.  Adams would be off to lunch.  He headed up to her office.

Ed knocked on the door, then let himself in.  Good, no one there.  It was easy to swap the item on Adams' desk for the one in the bag.  He slipped the Form 1661-G under the inner door for Dr. Clef.  That would excuse his visit; the auditors really did need it next week.

Back downstairs in his office, Ed opened a file cabinet and dropped SCP-050, still in its bag, next to the 2004 Operating Budget reports. It looked like someone's long-forgotten lunch.  He didn't care the least bit about "winning" it -- he just wanted it out of circulation. 

No one would guess that he had the wit to obtain it.
No one would guess that he had pulled this particular prank, since he wasn't supposed to have any access to SCPs.
No one ever came down to Accounting if they could help it.
SCP-050 would be there for a long time.

When they found the fake, they would blame Johnson, who had shown some real success in training SCP-157.

Research Assistant Reject was having a nice, calm day, sipping his coffee and skimming through his newest batch of paperwork while strolling down the hallway to his office. He was called Reject for a very good reason: although he had been a member of the Foundation for ten years, he had been the same rank for over seven of them. He even called himself Reject. His bachelorhood had hopelessly dragged on much longer than he had ever hoped. He was used to being a reject. That was, until he spotted a man in a suit walking into Dr. Clef's office.

Reject was never known as an especially observant person, but today was different. He had heard about some pranks going on, but he didn't really care about any of that. He was determined to work his way up the ladder without shaving cream or explosives, just with hard work and dedication. Until he saw a very happy man running out of Dr. Clef's office, his arms crossed upon his chest. Reject could see a brown paper bag bobbing slightly above and below the man's arms. His interest piqued, Reject decided to follow him.

The man never turned around as he walked. Reject didn't have any trouble following him. Ten minutes later, Reject realized just how far they had walked. He turned his head. "Accounting —>" was written on a sign, pointing in the direction that he was going. After another couple of minutes, the man turned sharply into an office. Reject peeked into the room to see another man converse shortly with the man he had followed and take the bag. Reject ducked behind a corner as both men exited the office.

Reject attempted to follow the man with the bag, but lost him in the maze of cubicles and offices in this unknown sector. Reject turned to leave, but decided not to let this go. This chance was his. He called up an old friend from Sector 28 with a favor to ask. His friend agreed, and in an hour, Reject knew that he would have the chance to become a Senior Staff member. He went to his office and placed an empty coffee mug alongside a mostly unread folder of paperwork.

One hour later, Reject met his friend in the cafeteria. Reject's friend handed him a bag with two words written on it. "DON'T LOSE." Reject smiled, and walked briskly down towards the accounting offices. Once there, he took the item out of the bag. Staring at a sentient calculator was a new experience for him. After befriending SCP-168, he asked his new buddy a favor. The calculator agreed in return for the ability to see the rest of the prank war. Reject dropped SCP-168 in the office he had seen before as soon as the man inhabiting it left. Reject admired his handiwork. He took a seat on a nearby chair. When the man returned, he gave Reject a questioning glance, but dismissed it. After five minutes in his office, a scream was heard. When the man exited his office, his face was pale white. In his hand was SCP-168.

The man looked at the calculator and said "Okay, okay. I'll go get it. I didn't realize the world would end if I didn't! I feel so awful…" Reject chuckled to himself and began to shadow the man as he hurried down the hallways. When they arrived at a file cabinet, the man stopped. He ran his finger along the cabinet until he reached "2004 Operating Budget Reports Jan-Mar." He started typing on the calculator. After a short period, the calculator responded. The man jumped back, aghast. He yelped "No! I brought you to the stupid monkey! That can't be!" Reject quickly decided he'd had enough of complaining from this unknown man and dealt a swift uppercut to the jaw followed by an elbow to the nose. As he fell, Reject grabbed SCP-168 and the brown paper bag. Overjoyed, he began to walk back to his office. He looked once more at the unconscious accountant on the ground. And then he laughed, and left this bloody, deceptive business behind him as he strolled back towards his office with a renewed sense of confidence.
