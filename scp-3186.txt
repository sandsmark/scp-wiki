**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3186 is to be contained behind a perimeter of two meter tall electrical fencing and kept under guard by two covert security personnel at all times. Any individuals attempting to gain access to SCP-3186 are to be interviewed and administered amnestics as is appropriate for their level of exposure.

**Description:** SCP-3186 is an area, referred to by locals as 'Roger's Hill', located on the outskirts of Tursley, Massachusetts. Prior to its development of anomalous properties, SCP-3186 was used by local teenagers as a location for romantic socialization.

When an individual is within SCP-3186 and looks up at the night sky, they will perceive the stars as moving to spell out a sequence of messages. There are nine messages in total, and the stars will move through this sequence on a loop until the viewer leaves SCP-3186. Note that this phenomenon is purely visual in nature, and no actual alteration of the stars is taking place.

Analysis of SCP-3186 suggests the use of thaumaturgy was involved in its creation using techniques described in several occult texts known to currently be in circulation.
