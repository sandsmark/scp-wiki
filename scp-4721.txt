**Item #:** SCP-4721

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4721 is to reside in a Standard Humanoid Containment Cell until further notice. The entity is permitted to attend weekly Greek lessons with the goal of facilitating communication. SCP-4721 is allowed access to mathematical resources and learning materials on request, contingent on good behavior.

**Description:** SCP-4721 is an anachronistic middle-aged human who identifies himself as Euclid[[footnote]] Author of mathematical textbook //Elements// and considered the father of geometry. [[/footnote]]. The entity possesses considerable skill in geometry and mathematical construction. SCP-4721 is fluent in Ancient Greek, permitting a rudimentary dialogue to form between the entity and Modern Greek speakers. 

SCP-4721 was discovered near the Bibliotheca Alexandria, a national library located in Alexandria, Egypt. Temporal analysis suggests SCP-4721 originates from approximately 2,300 years ago, but no further anomalous properties have been recorded. The identity of SCP-4721 was suspected after Dr. Krain, the first researcher to initiate contact, recognized that the entity was attempting to communicate through tapping the sequence of prime numbers.

**Addendum 4721-1:** Following over two years in containment, SCP-4721 grew notably unmotivated and distressed in any form of mathematics, despite having progressed through elementary algebra relatively well. This sudden change in behavior prompted an interview on May 27th, 2019. 

> **Interviewed:** SCP-4721 
> 
> **Interviewer:** Dr. Connor Krain
> 
> **Foreword:** Interview assisted by a translator in real time; all statements transcribed in English. 
> 
> **<Begin Log>**
> 
> **Dr. Krain:** Hello, Euclid. How are you today?
> 
> **SCP-4721:** Greetings, Doctor. I’m... alright.
> 
> **Dr. Krain:** I notice that you haven’t picked up a book all week. 
> 
> **SCP-4721:** I’ve been... busy. Why do you ask?
> 
> **Dr. Krain:** Well, ever since you first learnt about all the mathematics that’s been discovered since your time, you’ve constantly had your nose deep in a book. That is, before this year, when your checkout rates slowed to a halt. I was just asking if there was a particular reason why?
> 
> //SCP-4721 pauses before answering//
> 
> **SCP-4721:** I just... I don’t desire to do so, anymore.
> 
> **Dr. Krain:** Did you want to talk about it?
> 
> **SCP-4721:** I suppose it’s inevitable. Might as well.
> 
> **Dr. Krain:** Go ahead.
> 
> **SCP-4721:** Well, I’m growing older. I’m not as agile as I used to be, and ideas don’t come to me as quickly as they used to.
> 
> **Dr. Krain:** You’ve been struggling?
> 
> **SCP-4721:** Not just that. Struggling implies I have a chance. I feel like I’m completely overwhelmed by the amount of mathematics I have yet to and will never learn. 
> 
> **Dr. Krain:** It’s a big field, and you have a lot to catch up on. You can’t take that personally.
> 
> **SCP-4721:** It’s just... before, I used to be leading the charge. I was discovering the patterns of prime numbers; I was formalizing the postulates of geometry. And now, I’m struggling with problems even children easily surpass.
> 
> **Dr. Krain:** You have to realize the paradigm shift between your time and ours. So much has been developed over two millennia that the best anyone can hope for nowadays is to specialize in one particular area.
> 
> **SCP-4721:** But that’s the thing: I’m not even good enough to specialize in the field I founded! My work has been built on and expanded upon so much that it has become intertwined and inseparable from areas of math I haven’t even heard of! I’ve been left behind without the tools or ability to get back, nor the time or resilience to acquire such. 
> 
> **Dr. Krain:** And this has been upsetting you so much so as to disrupt your daily life?
> 
> **SCP-4721:** It’s... I have nothing to do in this stone prison other than math, and every time I do so I encounter nothing but frustration and disappointment. 
> 
> **Dr. Krain:** Well, I could look into other activities that you could-
> 
> **SCP-4721:** No, that wouldn’t solve it. I’m past my prime, and I just wish I could forget all about mathematics. My intellect can serve it no more.
> 
> **Dr. Krain:** You... want to forget it? All of it, even the geometry you discovered?
> 
> **SCP-4721:** I wish I could just forget everything and escape this numerical torment. But alas, it seems I am doomed to spend the rest of my years in this torturous cave.
> 
> **Dr. Krain:** Actually, I have an idea. Let me call in a few favors. 
> 
> **<End Log>**



**Addendum 4721-2:** On June 21st, 2019, after a two-week long deliberation, the O5 Council voted 6-6-1 on the issue of releasing SCP-4721 . As a result of this deadlock, the decision advanced to the Ethics Committee, which unanimously passed the motion to fully amnesticize SCP-4721 and release and reintegrate him into society. This was motivated by the lack of additional anomalous properties of SCP-4721 besides his anachronistic nature, and the mental distress brought upon him through containment. 

Upon the completion of the procedure, SCP-4721 is to be reclassified as neutralized. To ensure no anomalies develop as a result of the operation, Euclid shall be monitored at all times for the rest of his natural life.
