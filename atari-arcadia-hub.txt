Before there was ##purple|Arcadia##, it was just Nolan and Ted. They met while studying in the Stanford University Artificial Intelligence Lab in the sixties, and bonded over a shared love of the //Go// board game and occult rituals. Nolan and Ted saw opportunity in the lab's engrossing electronic games, and they took it.

The most popular game on campus was Spacewar!, a simple space combat game. The pair ripped that off with ease. But that wasn't the only thing they planned on ripping. They'd come up with an idea while they sat together mumbling incantations at midnight. Ted Dabney had conceived of a technological innovation that could unlock the secrets of harnessing the cursed magicks of the underworld. 

This was the genesis of the Dabney-Syzygy Inhibitor. Partnering with Nutting Engineering under the guise of developing a commercial computer game, the Inhibitor inside what would become "Computer Space" allowed them to refine their technique on half-drunk pinball players who didn't understand the ramifications of trading their souls for quarters.

Unlocking the secrets of Hell gave them a new conundrum: Portals to hell are a two-way street. Once you've opened that door you'd better be ready to parlay on the demon's terms. What if there was a way to moderate the energy coming through that aperture? Hold it open just a crack, let the corrupting power flow out without unleashing doom. Harness the energy given off when sending souls back through, double-dipping on a devil's bargain.

Even after going their own way and starting Atari, Inc. it seemed as though their great and terrible tech was doomed to languish in obscurity. While they had their golden goose, there didn't seem to be a market for its eggs. No mainstream or occult group had any interest in paying them. At least, until they got a very unusual delivery of Spicy Crust Pizza to their office one fateful night...

In 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson woke up in a cold sweat and began frantically sketching out a horrible visage which had come in his dreams. White squares endlessly batting back in forth in deep space forever. This triggered a chain of events which eventually led a mild-mannered engineer named Ralph Baer to take the President's sketch and create an interstellar communication and control device. He dubbed it the Brown Box. Thus began an odyssey of triumph and terror which would last for decades to come.

The SCP Foundation had ears everywhere and they knew of what Dabney and Bushnell were up to. In turn, Bushnell knew of Baer's discovery from public demonstrations of the Brown Box's more mundane aspects. This cross-pollination led to Atari's first big break. The Foundation would provide funding for a collective experience-gathering experiment to create a human capable of reliably engaging with the Brown Box. In exchange, Atari would supply their technology and occult expertise. The Foundation only needed the former, but Bushnell insisted on providing both.

While Bushnell could talk a big game, when he signed the dotted line he knew Atari needed to ramp up its infrastructure and fast. When the first check cleared he bought an old roller rink to use as a factory and went on a hiring spree. The most important hire of this early era was a gentle engineer named Al Alcorn.

[[include component:image-block name=http://www.ataricompendium.com/game_library/unreleased/vcs_nr_survival_run.png|caption=Promotional material for unreleased Al Alcorn project cancelled shortly before his resignation.|width=450px|align=left]]

Luring Alcorn in with the promise of being able to make a driving game, the inner circle of Atari began pressuring him to instead make their first prototype. This was when the group, gaining confidence, began calling themselves ##purple|Arcadia##, and their proposed product Pong. Bullied first into letting them inhabit his house, then take over his daughter's bedroom as a workspace, and finally to enthrall his daughter so that she could serve as a conduit for the experiences of every Pong player alive, poor Alcorn was quite broken by the time he left their employment.

Pong soon began selling hand-over-fist, flowing through the Sears' supply chain that the Foundation had opened up for them. Bushnell populated his roller-rink empire with degenerates and dropouts on the production floor. Behind the scenes, he scouted out the best and highest in the regional occult scene to come join Mr. Bushnell's wild ride.

It wouldn't be too long before the Foundation scooped up the project assets and cut ties with the darkening heart of Atari. Not that anyone at ##purple|Arcadia## was going to be noticing. They had amassed enough cash to indulge in their wildest fantasies and darkest impulses. At least, for awhile.

Although he had created the technology to make their success possible Dabney was quickly becoming disillusioned by the depths of Bushnell's depravity. After discovering that Bushnell had shattered the mind of his next-door neighbor for fun and profit, Dabney left the company. Not long after that the party ##purple|Arcadia## had been throwing for the rest of the company began to run out of steam.

Nolan was great at throwing a party and getting people to go along with his plans, not so much balancing a checkbook or exercising responsible oversight. Philosopher Ron Gordon was brought on to help staunch the bleeding and build Atari's credibility. Freed from the doldrums of managing the company day-to-day, Nolan threw himself full-time into entrenching and empowering ##purple|Arcadia## at the heart of the company.

Looking for more funding now that he didn't have the limitless funds of the men in black, ##purple|Arcadia## sold the company in 1976. They headquartered themselves in the Folger's mansion to better coordinate their activity at Atari in the off-hours. While the consumer division would produce products like the Video Computer System for games and the Atari 8-Bit computer family, ##purple|Arcadia## would piggyback on these developments to suit their own ends. 

Working at Atari at this time was a tricky proposition. You never knew whether the gal or guy sitting next to you was a regular employee or a satanist in business clothing. The drug culture had abated but never truly went away. There was never enough money coming in to make everyone feel comfortable. The culture was balancing of a knife's edge. 

In 1979, Nolan Bushnell left Atari to pursue his dream of owning a string of pizza parlor's. While he brought a little ##purple|Arcadian## flair with him to his new job, the cabal of warlocks and ne'er do wells he had founded was now on their own.

With the Atari 2600 video game console finding explosive success in 1980, ##purple|Arcadia## suddenly found itself marginalized within the company. No longer providing the lion's share of funding, they quickly began looking more like a liability than an asset. They began looking for outside support, ostensibly to shore up their position but mostly because there wasn't as much drug money to go around.

One of these ventures was a partnership with the U.S. Department of Defense. Applying what they'd learned experimenting with poor Ms. Alcorn they initiated [[[scp-2600| Project STELLA]]]. A juicy contract in hand, ##purple|Arcadia## was able to discreetly hire many of their former comrades. Even Ted Dabney was convinced to come back to work, if only as a consultant for his Inhibitor. Ultimately the ambitious project was too unstable for field use. Although it still paid of handsomely for ##purple|Arcadia##, the resources and goodwill it burned through hastened their downfall.

There had been warning signs that the end was coming. Talented ##purple|Arcadian## programmers were taking their special talents to greener pastures. Even the personal intervention of Bushnell [[[scp-4564| couldn't keep them on board]]]. Core members of the cabal were more interested in pursuing pie-in-the-sky hardware and pet projects than coordinated group action.

Atari as a whole was totally unprepared for the video game market crash of 1983. This Atari shock zapped the market to a fraction of its former value. Warner Communications', to whom Bushnell had sold the company all those years ago, decided to cut their losses. 

In a [[[scp-4605| New Mexico desert]]], bulldozers crushed tons of material belonging to ##purple|Arcadia## and Atari alike. Deprived of their mansion, their equipment, their funding, and their place of prominence, ##purple|Arcadia## would never again be able to dictate the terms. Now they would be lucky to survive at all.

The company was split in two, with the bulk of Atari and ##purple|Arcadia's## assets being sold to a savvy businessman by the name of Jack Tramiel. Still dreaming big despite their much shallower pockets the mystically-inclined personnel of the new company tried to hang tight as every one of their projects failed to make it out of the prototype stage. When the company finally died in the mid-90's there weren't many mourners among the now-former ##purple|Arcadians##.

[[include component:image-block name=http://www.ataricompendium.com/game_library/unreleased/vcs_nr_gato.png|caption=Computational device of unknown purpose, cancelled by Jack Tramiel.|width=300px|align=right]]

Meanwhile, the ##purple|Arcadian## remnants at Tengen would put out unlicensed, unofficial and [[[scp-1070| dangerously demonic]]] games along with the company's more mundane fare. The company was as good as dead by the early 90's but their ##purple|Arcadian## elements had [[[ballad-of-the-fifth-arcadian| withered away]]] long before that. Some of them would make their way back to Atari proper just in time for the final implosion from the Jaguar 

Any members who are still living have either scattered in the wind or exist only as individual occultists with an engineering hobby. A few may still correspond, reminiscing about the good old days. The empire they built burnt to the ground, with only scattered embers dimly glowing amidst the darkness.

[[tab Names]]

[[=]]
+ Key Organizations/Personnel
[[/=]]

__**Atari Inc. Arcadia:**__ The original organization, founded by Nolan Bushnell who loosely led it for most of his tenure at Atari. High-powered drug-fueled cabal of dark magic users ready and willing to use their magic for fun and profit.

__Nolan Bushnell:__ Ruthless businessman and marketer who found success after leaving a trail of bodies in his wake. Personally charming and charismatic, in one-on-one conversation he can convince just about anybody to do anything. Hair appears to be perpetually greasy no matter how many showers he takes.

__Ted Dabney:__ Occult machine designer responsible for the technology at the core of ##purple|Arcadia's## ability to act in the occult world, the Dabney-Syzygy Inhibitor. Indifferent to anything but the practical problems in front of him, he leaves the company after Bushnell offends and marginalizes him. Tries to be hard on the outside, but wracked with uncertainty over his choices and regret for the people he's harmed.

__Al Alcorn:__ Engineer hired by Bushnell and Dabney to develop their Pong machine. Soft-spoken with a sensitive heart, he was bullied into allowing ##purple|Arcadia## to destroy his family and steal his daughter. Left the company a broken man. 

__Ron Gordon:__ President of Atari and philosopher. Not involved with ##purple|Arcadia##, but indifferent to their activities apart from where it affected Atari's bottom line. Cooperated with ##purple|Arcadia## when they worked on virtual reality projects due to his personal fascination with the technology.

__Joe Keenan:__ Bushnell's next-door neighbor, who had his mind destroyed and rebuilt as Atari's "competitor" puppet. Ran the shell corporation Kee Games until he was no longer needed, at which point he was given a Vice President's office and left to languish.

__**Atari Games/Tengen Arcadia:**__ Atari Coin-Op division reborn as its own entity after the crash of '83. Unable to produce hardware, it mostly focused on being a third-party developer. Meanwhile, the witches and warlocks in its midst tried to imbue as many products as possible with their touch. To what end? Maybe it was just habit. They probably couldn't tell you either.

__Ed Logg:__ Talented engineer and game designer. Enthusiastic supporter of ##purple|Arcadia's## occult practices, especially in communing with the dead for advice on how to make his designs better.

__**Atari Corporation Arcadia:**__ The other half of Atari, purchased by Jack Tramiel after he was forced out of his first company, Commodore International. With more resources, they were able to invest in hare-brained schemes, but still lacked the capital to do anything with their creations. Even when they were able to make a viable product, it was more likely than not Jack would cancel it.

__Jack Tramiel:__ A self-made man, Jack had survived the Holocaust to become one of the most successful entrepreneurs of the micro-computer revolution. 

Jack was unfazed and less than amused by ##purple|Arcadia's## antics. They were put to work just like the other employees and if they couldn't produce, they were terminated. They would continue on unofficially, helping to enhance products up until the company went belly-up for good. While they would enchant and enthrall many unreleased products they essentially became a non-entity within the company.

[[tab Quick Start]]

= __Introduction__

There's a lot of information here about Atari ##purple|Arcadia##. But what are they? How can I write them? Why are they purple? This section is to answer some of those questions.

In a nutshell, when you boil it down from a bird's eye view this is what the group is: Nolan Bushnell and a cabal of drug-addled witches and warlocks making bank by imbuing Atari products with black magic fueled by the souls of children. Themes of drug use, abandonment,  corruption, memory loss and reversion to childhood have been used.

= __Using Arcadia__

You don't have to play into all the history I've laid out to use them. That's just there for inspiration and to flesh the group out beyond "dudes who made spicy video games and then died" or however they're going to be stereotyped. You can totally ignore all that. For example, [[[scp-4564| Butthole Surfers]]] is about eels who jump in people's guts and make them run to the ocean. It's triggered by copies of Fishing Derby, then loosely connected through a note to the developer from Nolan Bushnell.

Ultimately, you can ignore all of the background history and lore involved in Arcadia and just write an anomalous Atari game for pretty much any platform they were involved in, and it's probably going to work. 


= __Timeline__

When you're writing for Arcadia it can be set in any era from 1970~ on. Here's a rough timeline of their power level so you can adjust the depiction accordingly:

* //1970-1973:// Startup of just Nolan and Ted.
* //1973-1983:// Unstable colossus making and hemorrhaging money in equal quantities.
* //1983-1995~:// Once-mighty group splintered and deprived of money and just desperate to be relevant again.
* //1995-Present:// Disparate remnants across America, maybe still tinkering with games or maybe having given that up to become a gas station attendant or something

= __What About Tone?__

Tone-wise, lean towards old-school creep. The feeling you get when it's the middle of the night and you're all alone in your room playing the game past bedtime. The television set's high-pitched whine is the only thing you can hear, that and the chirping of crickets. Out of the corner of your eye, there's a graphical glitch. Maybe Evil Otto here to crush you with a smile? Yars finally coming for his revenge?

The screen snaps shut, and everything goes black.

[[tab Prompts]]

> The executives of ##purple|Arcadia## got into an entire decade's worth of hard drugs. Maybe a receipt from after a party submitted to an Atari expense account?

> Steve Jobs worked at Atari before they founded Apple. He worked at night because he smelled bad and refused to shower or wear deodorant. When he was alone he and Steve Wozniak would work on stuff together. Who knows what they might've seen lurking in Atari's offices at night?

> Letter from a former Arcadia member to another talking about the good old days and maybe, just maybe, getting back in the game.
