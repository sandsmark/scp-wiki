**Object Class**: Safe

**Special Containment Procedures**:

SPC-458 is considered safe and therefore is to be stored in the staff canteen at Site 17, with no restrictive access needed.  

**Description**:

SCP-458 is a large-sized pizza box from the pizza chain Little Caesars, of their Hot-n-Ready variety. It is made of simple cardboard, measures 10 inches by 10 inches by 1 inch, and weighs about 20 to 20.49 grams depending on toppings. As a result of the unusual nature of SPC-458, measurement of weight is inconsistant.

What makes SCP-458 an oddity is that, while appearing to be an ordinary pizza box, when it comes into contact with human hands, it instantaneously replicates within it the holder's preferred choice of pizza, down to favorite sauce, cheese, crust, and topping. It is not limited to the Little Caesars brand, as pizza from all major pizza chains, as well as local and even handmade pizzas have been produced. There seems to be no limit to its ability, except that it cannot make anything but pizza, and its toppings must be edible by normal human standards (see Addendum 1a). The box is also rather indestructible, as all tests to destroy or dismantle the box have proven fruitless.

It is assumed the box is semi-sentient, having at least enough telepathic or empathetic ability to sense what the holder's personal choices regarding pizza are.

After constant testing showed SCP-458's seemingly infinite power to generate pizza (but with little other use), it has henceforth been placed inside the cantine at Site-17 for free use by personnel. After its open usage has been allowed, personnel morale has shown to have sharply increased.

**Addendum 1a**: Upon testing SCP-458 with [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-083 SCP-083], the subject took a bite of the slice, which appeared to be a garlic-free slice of sausage and olive pizza on wheat crust, it was met with the response "It's a fine slice, but I would have preferred a rather… different sauce…" It was inferred that the box cannot use substances that are indigestible by regular human bodies. Further testing confirmed this.

**Addendum 1b**: //Please see document 458-1a//

**Document #458-1a**:
//I would just like to remind all staff that just because we have a pizza box that can constantly create pizzas for you does not mean that you can just sit around and eat pizza all afternoon. If continued abuse of the box continues, coupled with reports of personnel gaining unhealthy amounts of weight, I may be forced to implement a mandatory physical training regiment following lunch hours.//

//Further testing on SCP's may reveal some odd characteristics about the SCP's themselves, and is suggested.//
