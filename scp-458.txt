**Object Class**: Safe

**Special Containment Procedures**:

SPC-458 is considered safe, and therefor, is to be stored in the staff cantine, with no restrictive access needed.  

**Description**:

SCP-458 is a large-sized pizza box from the pizza chain Little Ceaser's, of their Hot-n-Ready variety.  It is made of simple cardboard, measures 10 inches by 10 inches by 1 inch, and weighs about 20 to 20.49 grams depending on toppings.  As a result of the unusual nature of SPC-458, it's exact measurement of weight is unsure.

What makes SCP-458 an oddity is that, while it is an ordinary pizza box, when it comes into contact with human hands, it instantaniously replicates, inside it, the holder's preffered choice of pizza, down to favorite sauce, cheese, crust, and topping.  It is not limited to the Little Ceaser's brand, as pizza from all major pizza chains, as well as local and even handmade pizzas have been produced.  There seems to be no limit to it's ability, except that it cannot make anything but pizza, and it's toppings must be edible by normal human standards (see Addendum 1a).  The box is also rather indestructable, as all tests to destroy or dismantle the box have proven fruitless.  

It is assumed the box is semi-sentient, having at least enough telepathic or empathetic ability to see what the holder's personal choices regarding pizza are.

After constant testing showed SCP-458's seemingly infinte power, it has hinceforth been placed inside the cantine for free use in personel.  After it's open usage has been allowed, personel morale has shown to have sharply increased.

**Addendum 1a**: Upon testing SCP-458 with [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-483 SCP-083], the subject took a bite of the slice, which appeared to be a garlic-free slice of sausage and olive pizza on wheat crust, it was met with the response "It's a fine slice, but I would have prefurred a rather... different sauce..."  It is implied and assumed that the box cannot use substances that are undigestable by regular human bodies.

**Addendum 1b**: //Please see document 458-1a//

**Document #458-1a**:
//I would just like to remind all staff that just because we have a pizza box that can constantly create pizzas for you does not mean that you can just sit around and eat pizza all afternoon.  If continued abuse of the box continues, coupled with reports of personel gaining unhealthy amounts of weight, I may be forced to empliment a mandatory physical training regiment following lunch hours.

For simple curiosity's sake, and to, perhaps, get a better idea of the mindset of certain SCP's, I have compiled a list of sentient SCP's reactions when holding the box.

[http://www.spc-wiki.wikidot.com/spc-040 SPC-040]: Small, extra cheese, cheese stuffed crust.

[http://www.spc-wiki.wikidot.com/spc-056 SPC-056]: Medium, sliced bell peppers, thin crust, alfredo sauce.

[http://www.spc-wiki.wikidot.com/spc-073 SPC-073]: Medium, onions, peppers, olives, thin crust.

[http://www.spc-wiki.wikidot.com/spc-076 SPC-076-02]: Large, meatballs, pepperoni, bacon, candian bacon, sausage, hamburger, thick crust.

[http://www.spc-wiki.wikidot.com/spc-103 SPC-103]: Small, pepperoni, mushrooms, thin crust.

[http://www.spc-wiki.wikidot.com/spc-105 SPC-105]: Small, olives, wheat crust, thin.

[http://www.spc-wiki.wikidot.com/spc-108 SPC-108]: Large, pepperoni, thick crust.

[http://www.spc-wiki.wikidot.com/spc-134 SPC-134]: Small, onions, olives, thin crust.

[http://www.spc-wiki.wikidot.com/spc-181 SPC-181]: Large, pepperoni, sausage, marinara stuffed crust. (Note: SPC-181 was told that this was a reward for good behavior, and that it was a lucky guess that it was his favorite type of pizza)

[http://www.spc-wiki.wikidot.com/spc-182 SPC-182]: Medium, olives, mushrooms, pretzel dough crust.

[http://www.spc-wiki.wikidot.com/spc-316 SPC-316]: Large, pepperoni, onions, mushrooms, olives, cheese-stuffed crust.

Further testing on SPC's may reveal some odd characteristics about the SPC's themselves, and is suggested.
