**Item #:** SCP-5097

**Object Class:** Uncontained

**Special Containment Procedures:** In the event SCP-5097 returns to existence, it is to be severely reprimanded and placed in a humanoid containment cell.

The note SCP-5097 left behind is currently held in an Anomalous Items locker.

**Description:** SCP-5097 is [http://www.scp-wiki.net/somnambulant-directives-take-the-helm Senior Researcher Kassidy Kara], a former member of the Site-17 Extra-Realistics Department[[footnote]] Up until their classification as SCP-5097, Dr. Kara had worked under the Foundation for 6 years. [[/footnote]]. On 4/8/20, Dr. Kara spontaneously ceased existing.

**Discovery Log:** SCP-5097 was discovered after Foundation .aic units detected a sudden loss of data associated with Dr. Kara[[footnote]] Their personnel file was the first to be detected as missing. Their reports on multiple anomalies were found to be blanked shortly after, followed by their SCiPnet account becoming invalid. [[/footnote]] at 9:58 PM on 4/9/20. At the same time, several personnel acquainted with Dr. Kara had noticed their lack of activity around the Site, and could neither access past e-mails with Dr. Kara nor send them new ones via SCiPnet.


An investigation was launched, revealing their private quarters contained only a handwritten note on their desk (see Addendum). Whom it was addressed to is unknown.

Automated extranormal detection programs deployed by Site Command picked up on dramatic fluctuations of [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-5850 olf values][[footnote]] Hypothetical measurements used to quantify anti-dimensions or anti-spacetime phenomena within a given system. Olf values closer to 0 operate similarly to our reality. [[/footnote]] in Dr. Kara's quarters. From the readings, a timeline of the fluctuations was established, revealing Dr. Kara had ceased existing on 4/8/20 at approximately 4:25 AM. 

Dr. Kara was designated as SCP-5097 on 4/10/20, and the containment procedures were put in place shortly after.
