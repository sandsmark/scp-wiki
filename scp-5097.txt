**Anomaly Class:** Uncontained

**Special Containment Procedures:** In the event SCP-5097 returns to existence, it is to be severely reprimanded and placed in a humanoid containment cell.

The note SCP-5097 left behind is currently held in an Anomalous Items locker.

**Description:** SCP-5097 was previously [http://www.scp-wiki.net/somnambulant-directives-take-the-helm Senior Researcher Kassidy Kara], a member of the Site-17 Extra-Realistics Department. On 4/8/20, Dr. Kara spontaneously ceased existing.

**Discovery Log:** SCP-5097 was discovered after Foundation .aic units detected a sudden loss of data associated with Dr. Kara[[footnote]] Their personnel file was the first to be detected as missing. Their reports on multiple anomalies were found to be blanked shortly after, followed by their SCiPnet account becoming invalid. [[/footnote]] at 9:58 PM on 4/9/20. At the same time, several personnel acquainted with Dr. Kara had noticed their lack of activity around the Site and the inability to access their SCiPnet email.

An investigation was launched, revealing their private quarters were completely empty with the exception of a note (see Addendum). Whom it was addressed to is unknown.

Automated extranormal detection programs deployed by Site Command picked up on dramatic fluctuations of [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-5850 olf values][[footnote]] Hypothetical measurements used to quantify anti-dimensions or anti-spacetime phenomena within a given system. Olf values closer to 0 operate similarly to our reality. [[/footnote]] in Dr. Kara's quarters. From the readings, a timeline of the fluctuations was established, revealing they had ceased existing on 4/8/01 at approximately 4:25 AM. 

Dr. Kara was designated as SCP-5097 on 4/10/01, and the containment procedures were put in place shortly after.
