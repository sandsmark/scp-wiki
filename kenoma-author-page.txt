Dear %%title%%,
[[/module]]

It's me, Kenoma! I would love to answer your questions!

I was never a good writer, to be honest. Still, I do enjoy writing sometimes, especially during the most boring times. I mostly read Wikipedia articles, religious texts and the works of H.P. Lovecraft.

I wrote my first SCP in 2017, but due to an incident, I --had to-- deleted 5 of my first SCPs that I've written within one or two months. It was really sad. I resumed writing a few months later and managed to co-write an article with Zyn, but after that, I stopped because of school.

It was only recently that I started writing again. Here are my current SCPs:

Now, I'm a game designer and developer. I'm currently working on an SCP Card Game titled "[https://kenoma.itch.io/scp-card-game Uncontained]". It's a project I've been working on with a few pals from [https://discord.gg/Ff9Exju Discord] for almost three months now. Everything that you can visually see on the game is from [https://sinsekai20130227.tumblr.com/ SINSEKAI], which is also part of the team.

Anyways, thanks for taking the time to read my sad and miserable author page! :)

PS: I would love to work on more SCP games in the future. Feel free to chat me on Discord (Kenoma#2916) or PM me here. Check my [https://kenoma.itch.io/ itch page] for the games I've made so far!

Talk to you soon,
Kenoma
