I was never a good writer, to be honest. Still, I do enjoy writing sometimes, especially during the most boring times. I mostly read Wikipedia articles, religious texts and the works of H.P. Lovecraft.

I wrote my first SCP in 2017, but due to an incident, I --had to- deleted 5 of my first SCPs that I've written within one or two months. It was really sad. I resumed writing a few months later and managed to co-write an article with Zyn, but after that, I stopped because of school.

It was only recently that I started writing again. Here are my current SCPs:
[[module ListPages created_by="Kenoma" order="created_at" separate="no" tags="-author -tale" perPage="250" prependLine=""]]
* %%title_linked%% (+%%rating%%, %%comments%% comments) created on %%created_at%%
[[/module]]

Now, I'm a game designer and developer. I'm currently working on an SCP Card Game titled "[https://kenoma.itch.io/scp-card-game Uncontained]". It's a project I've been working on with a few pals from Discord for almost three months now. Everything that you can visually see on the game is from [https://sinsekai20130227.tumblr.com/ SINSEKAI], which is also part of the team.

Anyways, thanks for taking the time to read my sad and miserable author page! :)
