**Item #:** SCP-1377

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Instances of SCP-1377-01 are to be preserved after initial intake and observation in the C Wing of the Site-23 morgue, which has been repurposed for containment protocols and retrofitted with necessary security infrastructure. Access to SCP-1377-01 instances for experimentation require written authorization from the Research Director and the Cybernetics Initiative Committee. 

During the appearance of a new iteration of SCP-1377-01, designated liaisons from security organizations responsible for national legislatures will contact the Research Director immediately. The Research Director will then relay instructions to MTF Kappa-71 (Roberto's Rules of Order), which will either neutralize and contain SCP-1377-01 directly, or direct Foundation security assets in closest proximity to the event to do so.

Due to the politically sensitive nature of SCP-1377 events, use of amnestic drugs on witnesses during subsequent information control efforts is to be minimized; see Protocol 1377-SOLON documentation for more details. All information control procedures related to SCP-1377 must be approved by the Research Director prior to implementation.  

**Description:** SCP-1377 is a phenomenon affecting world legislative bodies. Beginning in 1952 and continuing into the present day, a humanoid automaton of varying physical characteristics (hereby referred to as an instance of SCP-1377-01) will make its way from an unknown origination point to an official session of a national legislative body, present a set of forged credentials identifying itself as a member of that body, and attempt to address the chamber. In all cases, the forged credentials have identified SCP-1377-01 as a representative of a fictitious constituency within that nation's jurisdiction; examples include impersonations of an MP of the United Kingdom Parliament from "Lockbarrow," a Chilean Deputy representing the "Camino Desconocido" region, a Botswana Assembly Member from "Nnwande West", and a United States Senator representing the State of "Kenswick".

SCP-1377-01 instances are composed of living, organic tissue, and bear a loosely analogous resemblance to //Homo sapiens//. However, the anatomy of SCP-1377-01 varies significantly from that of humans; specimens possess musculature and connective tissues similar to //H. sapiens//, but lack any discernible internal organs, instead featuring an indeterminate, fleshy mass where a human's thoracic cavity would ordinarily be. Additionally, SCP-1377-01 specimens have a skeletal structure composed of tissue resembling hardened cartilage. This is believed to account for SCP-1377-01's erratic and halting movements. DNA analysis confirms that SCP-1377-01 matches no biological organism currently known to the Foundation. Because of the lack of data on SCP-1377-01 specimens prior to their emergence, development of these organisms is poorly understood. However, each SCP-1377-01 instance has ceased life function approximately 12-18 hours after emergence. 

Currently, 27 instances of SCP-1377-01 have been documented in 24 nations since the first known occurrence on 04/23/1952. All instances of SCP-1377-01 have been recovered and taken into Foundation custody, with the exception of SCP-1377-01.14 (see Incident 1377-1). If allowed to proceed into the legislative chambers at which the specimen emerges, SCP-1377-01 will make a "speech". The content of this "speech" has varied greatly between instances of SCP-1377-01: The first observed occasion consisted of SCP-1377-01.3 vocalizing a series of static-like screeches and electronic tones; SCP-1377-01.7 addressed the Supreme People's Council of South Yemen with an eight-minute imitation of aggressive hooting noises typically made by //Gorilla beringei//; and most recently, SCP-1377-01.27 was documented at the German //Reichstag// engaging in speech patterns that, while resembling the sound of human speech, contained no discernible linguistic structure or pattern.

//The following is the original promulgation of Protocol 1377-SOLON, issued by Dr. Carl Wyland, first Research Director for SCP-1377.//

> **MEMORANDUM**
> 
> **From:** Dr. Wyland
> 
> **To:** SCP-1377 Security Personnel
> 
> **RE: CONTAINMENT OF SCP-1377-01 SPECIMENS**
> 
> To my valued associates,
> 
> SCP-1377 presents a unique challenge to containment, due to its propensity for exposure in the highest visibility arena possible, the lawmaking chambers of national governments. We do not currently understand why this anomaly manifests in such a manner, nor have we identified any responsible parties. In the meantime, however, the emerging use of broadcast television to record governmental proceedings has made any possible containment measures orders of magnitude more difficult. With this in mind, the following parameters have been prescribed by Site Director █████:
> 
> * The SCP Foundation liaisons in the governments of all industrialized nations have been briefed on the existence of SCP-1377. They have been instructed to provide cover stories to other personnel within their respective governments that instances of SCP-1377 are top-secret experiments in robotic technology. 
> 
> * The recent development of amnestic drugs for use in information control has provided the Foundation with a very useful tool. However, due to questions about lingering aftereffects on brain chemistry and the potential impact on governmental figures, the use of these drugs in containing information about SCP-1377 is __prohibited without my express consent__. 
> 
> * Initial field research on the behavior of SCP-1377 has been authorized. As of this time, SCP-1377-01 specimens have not exhibited harmful properties or intentions. Therefore, recovery of these specimens may be performed at the discretion of researchers in the field documenting SCP-1377-01's activities. Should these specimens display potentially threatening behavior, however, Foundation security personnel are authorized to neutralize SCP-1377-01 immediately. 
> 
> * All broadcasts in the immediate vicinity of an SCP-1377-01 appearance are to be suppressed and edited as soon as possible. Use of amnestic drug regimens is authorized for members of the press corps and civilians per established Foundation guidelines. 
> 
> These parameters are in effect until further notice. On a closing note, I ask you not to speculate on the origin of SCP-1377; leave that to the researchers. Coupled with unrelated, sensationalistic news reports appearing recently, this is causing needless alarm among staff.
> 
> Secure. Contain. Protect.

**Addendum 1377-1:** The last three instances of SCP-1377-01 (09/14/1998 in Santiago, 01/03/2004 in Baghdad, and 03/30/2012 in Berlin) have all displayed similar physical characteristics, a previously undocumented phenomenon. In each case, SCP-1377-01 bears the appearance of O5-██. Analyses have determined that the probability of two individuals exhibiting the same facial biometric data, as SCP-1377-01.27 and O5-██ apparently do, is a statistically insignificant non-zero quantity. 

This represents a marked increase in sophistication in SCP-1377's theorized attempts to mimic human appearance. Previous specimens, while increasingly accurate between instances, have had the appearance of crude imitations, and were easily recognizable as such. SCP-1377-01.25 through SCP-1377-01.27 all possess faces that exactly match the appearance of O5-██ (although factors such as height and weight have varied). 

All subsequent instances of SCP-1377-01 are to be immediately reported to Overwatch Command by the Research Director.
