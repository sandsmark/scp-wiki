**Item #:** SCP-1682

**Object Class:** --Safe-- Neutralized

**Special Containment Procedures:** --Because of its size and distance from Earth SCP-1682 is considered effectively contained; this is due to the fact that SCP-1682 does not seem to be capable and has not attempted to break gravitational pull of the sun, and containment breach does not appear to be a possibility. SCP-1682 appears to move in a looping motion, this is believed to be as result of a variety of factors including but not limited to gravitational pull, because of this the apparition of SCP-1682 can be accurately predicted before each actual sighting. SCP-1682 is by all means self-contained.-- 

--Civilians coming into possession of proper EUI imaging powerful enough to view SCP-1682 does not factor in to containment due to the expense of such equipment and its exclusivity. The Foundation is to dispatch embed agents  to organizations and governments in possession of such devices before said equipment is first acquired; disinformation protocol 1029-Wanambi is to be set in motion should images come into the possession of civilians, although due to the creatures low visibility and visible similarity to common solar phenomenon this is not a foreseeable problem.--

**Description:** SCP-1682 is believed to be a large, serpent-like entity located in the sun.  Approximate length of the entity is believed to be 28,075 km, this data was found measuring the time between first initial emergence to it's disappearance from the photosphere. The appearance of SCP-1682 near solar prominence is believed to be coincidental as the entity's apparition in relation to the features is not consistent.

Attached Image No #: 1682-H displays the typical diving and looping motion of SCP-1682. The entity appears to roam the surface of the photosphere for 3-4 months before disappearing again beneath for periods of 8-12 months. The extended periods of disappearance, glowing appearance upon resurfacing, and the angle and speed of the entity in relation to the general surface of the photosphere suggest brief contact with radiative portions of the suns interior.

--No abnormal change in solar activity has been recorded since SCP-1682s arrival in 1986, and the exact nature of the entity remains to be seen.--

**Addendum 1682-N:** On 11/28/2011, SCP-1682 emerged from the photosphere at a speed of 1073 m/s, effectively escaping the gravitational pull of the sun. SCP-1682 passed Pluto on 11/30/2011 and the heliosphere on 12/02/2011. 

**Addendum 1682-N-2, note from Researcher Breen:**

> //I can't really put a finger on what was happening on the sun for all of those years, and I don't think I really want to.//
> 
> //The men and I believe that the creature... whatever it was, was 'refueling' for another jaunt into another star, somewhere. Everyone seems relieved, but I can't shake this anxiety that something awful has just happened. I don't think I'll see it, I don't think any of us will, not my grandchildren, or theirs... but I know something awful just happened that none of us had any control over.//

> //It doesn't look as bright to me... I know I can see that.//
