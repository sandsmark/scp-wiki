**Item #:** SCP-1467
**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedure:** 
"SCP-1467 should be contained in a padded cell with no less than three(3) audio recording devices installed in the walls. Batteries are to be changed weekly. SCP-1467 should be medicated using document '23-A' and a therapist meeting should be provided once(1) every week. SCP-1467 should always be referred to in person as 'Mr Smith', as referring to it by any other means throws it into a panic/rage state. This have resulted in moderate injuries to it and research personnel, and have seriously impeded attempts to interview the subject and keep its mental state stable.  Foundation personnel wishing to visit or make use of SCP-1467 for experiments must seek permission with its currently designated therapist. In the event of a containment breach, immediate termination of SCP-1467 is authorised. Records of SCP-1467 should be reviewed every month, and at least six backups should be kept in different locations at all times.

**Description** SCP-1467 is a a 47 year old male of African American descent. Unless constantly reaffirming its existence,  SCP-1467 slowly fades out of reality. The effect manifests in a gradual decrease in the ability to perceive SCP-1467 by any known means until it eventually vanishes. This has been known to affect objects and personnel in SCP-1467 immediate vicinity. The Foundation have been unable to determine the extent of this ability to a satisfiable degree but current experimental data suggests it is localised to SCP-1467. The subject claims to be a construction worker. It further claims its anomalous properties arose in a gradual fashion after the death of its wife and children in a car accident. During this time it developed several coping mechanism to keep its slowly degrading condition under a modicum of control. Habits such as repeating its name, checking its pulse, keeping itself talking to others, drawing and writing descriptions of itself on its body and surrounding surfaces and keeping recordings of its voice going while sleeping all developed over time. Currently the Foundation have found no records of subjects stated wife, children, house, car or extended family ever having existed. There have been no car accident at the given date, no graves could be found, the provided address has never been in use, and all relevant social security numbers remain unassigned in what appears to be due to computer error. The only evidence of SCP-1467 existence consists of a few co-workers remembering it, but accounts vary widely. As an example, construction worker ██████ ████████ described as a "close friend" were unable to recall subjects skin color with certainty. As a result of the mental stress subject is under, it has developed a severe cause of bi-polar depression, in addition to chronic sleep deprivation. Its anomalous condition continue to deteriorate. By current estimates, Foundation will have lost it by 20██-██

**Addendum-1** Please note the containment procedures only calls for referring to SCP-1467 as 'Mr Smith' while in its vicinity, and this only due to its sensitive mental state. At all other times it should be referred to using its SCP designation. It has been noted personnel assigned to SCP-1467 have repeatedly failed to do so. Further violations will be severely reprimanded. Keep it professional. -Director ████

**Experiment Logs**

**Experiment #16:**
**Test procedure:** SCP-XXX was restrained and made unable to speech. Researcher assistant Reiner and Dieter were in the room and kept observing subject. Dr Thorns supervised from an adjacent room.
**Date:* █████-██-██* 
** **Results:** 
10m:12s : Unable to recognize subject as SCP-1467.
14m:32s : Unable to recognize clothes of SCP-1467
19m:07s : unable to identify SCP-1467 race. 
24m:00s : unable to identify what SCP-1467 is currently doing.
35m:46s : unable to identify how SCP-1467 is sitting. 
39m:41s : unable to identify anything save the presence of a humanoid creature in the room.
Research Assistant Dieter started a recording at this point, consisting of SCP-1467 describing himself. Subject returned to a describable state, curled up in a fetus like position on the floor. No sign of the restraints or the chair subject was placed in. SCP-1467 was provided Class B amnesiacs after experiment. Subsequent tests showed similar results, with a minor variation in timing, tending downwards.
**Test Conclusion:** It would appear SCP-1467 condition is slowly getting worse, and that it can affect others than itself. - Dr Thorns

**Experiment #19:**
**Test procedure:** Experiment 16 was repeated. At the humanoid creature phase assistant researchers,  were replaced by D-Class personnel with prior experience in SCP testing. D Personnel will hereafter be referred to as D-1 and D-2. 
**Date:* █████-██-██* 
** **Results:** 
D Personnel expressed agitation at the half perceived creature.  D-1 clawed against the door while D-2 kept his eyes at what remained of SCP-1467. The following conversation was recorded. 
Assistant Reiner "Please describe what you see."
D-1 "[Expletive Redacted] let us out!"
D-2 "I don't know, there's... it's... there's something in here! I can't see it."
Assistant Reiner "How do you know there is something in there?"
D-2"[Expletives Redacted]"
Assistant Reiner "How do you know there is something in there?"
D-2 "I can feel it! Dude, it vanished, get them to open the [Expletive Redacted] door!"
D-1 "I'm trying, I'm trying!"
Assistant Reiner. "Please remain calm."
D-2 "It's coming for us! I can tell it is coming for us!"
At this point D-2 started screaming. D-1 started crying. A recording of SCP-1467 describing himself was activated, and armed personnel entered the room. D-1 was curled up in a fetus position at the entrance. D-2 was found lying a bit further away unconscious and was initially mistaken for SCP-1467. SCP-1467 was initially unlocatable, but after approximately 3 minutes, 19 seconds, could be found leaning against the far wall, clutching his head in his hand, apparently suffering a panic attack. 
Class B amnesiacs were administered to SCP-1467. 

**Test Conclusion:** Due to the strain on SCP-1467 already stressed psyche coupled with the apparent localised nature of its condition  this line of testing has been suspended.
