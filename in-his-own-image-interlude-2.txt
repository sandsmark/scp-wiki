//"Hey!"// 

//Lament jumped at his desk, turning and looking up at the woman. Long, lightly curling, brown hair. Constant smirk. Mirthy eyes.//

//"Heya, Sophie," he said, grinning as he stood. The smile came to his face easy. It always seemed to around her. "Hey, listen, I got you something..."//

//"Oh...? Gifts? On a first date?"//

//"It's just lunch!" he defended. It was a date.//

//"Regardless, sir. Most unbecoming." Still that smirk. God, he loved that smirk.//

//"Well, I couldn't pay for the meal, since we're on base, so..." He pulled out a clear, glass vial, passing it to her carefully.//

//"Someone told me you like... ctenophores."//

//She looked down at it, then up at him, her face registering a mix of shock and joy.//

//"Best. Date. Ever."//

//Hehe. It was a date.//
