**Item#**: SCP-311  

**Object Class**: Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures**: Contained in High Security Item Storage Unit █ at Sector █. Sealed to all personnel without written authorization from three Level 4 or better senior staff. Item barred for use in further research pending O5 comprehensive review.

**Description**: SCP-311 are a pair of plain black gloves. They exhibit extreme flexibility which allows them to fit every hand size tested.

Object was recovered from █████████ ██████, a professed "voodoo" practitioner implicated in █ suspicious murders in [DATA EXPUNGED] Following the incident the body and all the subject's belongings, including the gloves, were appropriated by the Foundation for containment and study. 

When worn the gloves seem innocuous and present no danger to the wearer. Subject responds normally to trauma inflicted on any part of the body, except the hands where the gloves are worn. All trauma of any tested kind inflicted on the subject's hands is displaced to another individual, theorized to be whatever individual the subject is thinking of at the time. Both gloves need to be worn for this effect to occur, but the subject need not be aware of the item's properties. (More detailed analysis of SCP-311's properties in Test Log 311-01)

> Note: Subject's wife and daughter were admitted to ██████ General Hospital later that day presenting with severe acid burns on their hands and heavy blood loss. █████████ was pronounced dead later that night.

**Directive 311-02**: Due to the potential capabilities of SCP-311 and the high possibility of misuse, it has been decided to isolate it in a Level-4 classified location pending review. It is also true that the artifacts might prove useful in extreme situations where handling dangerous SCP's proves necessary. In such a case the use of SCP-311 as supplementary containment equipment will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.
