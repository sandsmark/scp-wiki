[[/div]]

**Item #:** SCP-1000

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Mobile Task Force Nu-6 “Triple-Dog Daredevils” is tasked with tracking SCP-1000 to the best of their ability. Active members of Nu-6 must appear to be between the ages of 12 and 18, and have experience in undercover work. Support personnel also require experience in undercover operations but may be of any physical appearance. Once SCP-1000 has ceased migration, Nu-6 will pose as minors and attempt to discredit any statements made about the area inhabited by SCP-1000, hereby SCP-1000-1.

Each instance of SCP-1000-1 is to be monitored at all times.  Any minors approaching SCP-1000-1 between sunset and sunrise are to be detained and interrogated, then administered amnesiacs and released.  If possible, false memories detailing the failure of any tasks they came to accomplish should be implanted.

**Description:** SCP-1000 is an incorporeal entity or group of entities that resembles a group of between 1000 and 1300 small dark objects. SCP-1000 is only visible in very dim light, rendering it invisible from shortly before sunrise to shortly after sunset and difficult to see otherwise; however, it is almost always several degrees cooler than its surroundings, allowing it to be tracked via infrared sensors. Except during migration events, SCP-1000 will display no activity whatsoever.
SCP-1000 will usually only remain in one area for a period of between three months and ten years, with the median time of residence being fifteen months. After this period of time, SCP-1000 will leave and fly to a new destination at a mean speed of 65 kph, rarely exceeding 80 kph. SCP-1000 will rarely fly in a direct path to its destination, instead deviating by up to 170% from the ideal route. On average, SCP-1000 will travel approximately 950 kilometers before choosing a new habitat.

SCP-1000 tends to inhabit manmade structures, although by no means will it restrict itself to artificial habitats. In every recorded instance, SCP-1000-1 has been in an area accessible to the public. SCP-1000-1 has, in the past, been:
*Churches. In all cases, churches inhabited by SCP-1000 have always been over 53 years old at time of migration. No other religious center has become SCP-1000-1 for any period of time.
* Cemeteries. SCP-1000 appears to have a preference for cemeteries with large gates. Said gates often require frequent maintenance to prevent rusting.
* Caves.  Subterranean areas that have been SCP-1000-1 frequently become colonized by bats after SCP-1000 departs.
* Trees and stumps over two meters in diameter. Oak trees are the most common tree for SCP-1000 to “roost” in.
* A variety of abandoned buildings in varying states of disrepair. SCP-1000 has attempted to inhabit SCP-████ on █ separate occasions, in each case compounding [DATA EXPUNGED], requiring Mobile Task Force Gamma-5’s assistance. 
* Densely forested areas. Forests containing SCP-1000 have been noted to become significantly darker after containment and appear to remain so indefinitely.
* Small bodies of water, such as swamps, ponds, and the shores of lakes. In these cases, SCP-1000-1 has always been the site of a person or persons drowning.
* Amusement parks and other outdoor recreational areas. Persons who enter SCP-1000-1 during these instances are highly unlikely to dispose of refuse properly.

In a disproportionately large number of cases (16.3%), SCP-1000-1 has been the scene of at least one death prior to hosting SCP-1000.  Said death has been within twenty years of containment in each incidence.  ███ separate incidences of SCP-1000-1 have been recorded since discovery in 18██.

--A full log of SCP-1000-1 is available as Document 1000-1.-- After several researchers expressed interest in personally visiting instances of SCP-1000-1, Document 1000-1 now requires Level 4 clearance. 

The effects of SCP-1000 being present at SCP-1000-1 are believed to begin approximately three days after SCP-1000 has ceased migration, although they may not become apparent for another week. The primary effect of SCP-1000 is the creation of rumors or “urban legends” regarding SCP-1000-1, often concerning supposed deaths or otherwise abnormal activity in the area. In one case, the rumor detailed activities highly similar to Nu-6’s standard procedures, rendering them ineffective. Usually, these rumors (collectively SCP-1000-2) are begun and spread among the youth population of the population center nearest SCP-1000-1 [[footnote]] When SCP-1000-1 is near a large population center such as a city, SCP-1000-2 will generally be restricted to several city blocks or one neighborhood, although one [DATA EXPUNGED] [[/footnote]].

A feature common to every instance of SCP-1000-2 is that, between two and three weeks after SCP-1000 arrives at SCP-1000-1, a rumor will surface to the effect that performing certain actions in or near SCP-1000-1 will yield results that, given the nature of the actions, would normally be considered implausible or nonsensical. In most cases, the “ritual” involves some form of minor self-mutilation or the mutilation and/or killing of an animal, usually a domestic animal common to the area around SCP-1000-1. These rumors are only acted upon by persons under the age of eighteen, with the rare exception of intoxicated young adults making attempts. When similar rumors were produced as a test (see Experiment Log 1000-4), nearly all children interviewed (94%) were able to identify which had been created by the researchers, whereas 49% of all other persons interviewed were capable of doing so.

Examples of rituals produced by SCP-1000 include:
* Placing a dead cat on a grave near SCP-1000-1A was intended to cure the mumps.
* Fornication in or under SCP-1000-1DG would not result in the transmission of pathogens, provided no other precautions against infection were taken.
* Repeating the phrase “The song brings her” eight times with one’s eyes closed inside the deepest portion of SCP-1000-1BL was supposed to cause the ghost of ████ ███████, who died in SCP-1000-1BL in late 18██, to kill the speaker. 
* Self mutilation at midnight in SCP-1000-1██ resulting in significant blood loss will grant access to an item [DATA EXPUNGED]; notably, SCP-███ was recovered from the area several months earlier.

Note that all rituals produced by SCP-1000 are completely nonfunctional and each is unique in nature and intended results. Reported failures of these attempts have been somewhat effective in discouraging others from making attempts. At this stage, it is estimated that 23% of all persons under the age of 18 who are told one of these rituals and the proper location to do so will attempt them.

SCP-1000-2 will change over time, rarely staying stable for longer than five days. After SCP-1000-1 has been active for three weeks, the related rituals will be replaced with steadily more violent versions, in some cases requiring several deaths to “successfully” activate it, with correspondingly larger supposed payouts. Up to 35% of persons under the age of 18 will attempt to perform these actions. It should be noted that deterring those who try to access SCP-1000-1 during this time becomes increasingly difficult.

After SCP-1000 migrates from SCP-1000-1, SCP-1000-1 is most commonly avoided by locals whenever possible for several years later. The rumors and legends regarding SCP-1000-1 will stay, along with the mildest versions of the rituals involving SCP-1000-1.

Research into creating reliable and inexpensive containment procedures for SCP-1000 is underway.
