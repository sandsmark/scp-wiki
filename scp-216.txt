**Item #:** SCP-216

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-216 currently resides in storage area C and may be accessed by personnel with a security clearance level of 1/216 or higher.

**Description:** SCP-216 is a 35.6cm (14in) high iron safe with a multiple-dial combination lock. The lock has 7 dials each with numbers ranging from 0 to 9. The combination cannot be changed while the door is open. The device weighs approximately 935 kg including its contents.

The door of SCP-216 can always be opened, but the accessible interior space appears to change depending on the currently entered combination. Objects placed inside SCP-216 may be accessed by re-entering the combination that was configured when the object was inserted. Objects retrieved from SCP-216 appear to be undamaged by the device.

It is speculated that every possible lock combination results in a different interior, and that there are therefore 10 million available compartments. It is unknown how many objects currently reside inside SCP-216.

Initial testing uncovered traces of sawdust inside compartment 0000000.

**Addendum:** 5/26: Dr. █████ Initial experiment log

**Test 1**
- Combination lock set to 6692724 and door opened. Compartment appears empty.
- 1 notebook and pencil placed inside and door closed.
- Combination lock set to 6692725 and door opened. Compartment appears empty.
- Combination lock re-set to 6692724 and door opened. Notebook and pencil retrieved from compartment.

Note: //"SCP appears to be a very efficient storage solution. May come in useful as a temporary or permanent replacement for the now inaccessible staff locker room on floor 6, following the events of [DATA EXPUNGED]."// - Dr █████

**Test 2**: Testing the effect of inserted items on the SCP's total weight
- Total weight of unit before inserting item: 935.877 kg
- Notebook and pencil (total weight 350 g) inserted into SCP-216 and door closed.
- Total weight of unit after inserting item: 936.057 kg

Expected weight: 936.217 kg
Actual weight: 936.057 kg
Difference: 160 g

Testing shows that SCP-216 takes on approximately 54% of the weight of its contents.

**Document #** 152-D: Dr. █████ Test log

Compartments 0000332 - 0000398: Each compartment had a body part from █████ ███████, a 28-year-old female who had been reported missing on ██/██/20██. Contents removed for identification and then incinerated. Liver, spleen and lungs not recovered.

**Document #** 159-B: Dr. ████████████ Test log

Compartment 0000409: A live wolverine (//Gulo gulo//), (adult male, weighing 30 kg). Upon the door being opened, it attacked and killed Dr. ███████, and mutilated two nearby D-class personnel, before being shot five times by guards. Autopsy revealed it to be a normal, non-anomalous wolverine.

Subsequent examination of compartment 0000409 has revealed it now contains only loose wolverine hair, with residual traces of wolverine urine and wolverine anal musk.

**Document #** 160-A: Dr. ████████████ Test log

Compartment 0000456: A fully loaded Glock 19 handgun with a round in the chamber, and one regular flavor Klondike Bar ice cream dessert. The ice cream bar was not melted, cold to the touch and remained so as long as it was in the compartment. It was removed for inspection, and began to melt within 2 minutes. It was placed back in the compartment; the door closed for 3 hours, and then reopened. The ice cream bar was in the same slightly melted state as when it was placed back three hours prior. The ice cream bar was removed, placed in a freezer in the nearby 2nd floor cafeteria for one hour. After one hour it was placed back into the compartment with the handgun and the door closed.
