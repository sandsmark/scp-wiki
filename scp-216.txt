**Item #:** SCP-216

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-216 currently resides in storage area C and may be accessed by personnel with a security clearance level of 1/216 or higher.

**Description:** SCP-216 is a 14" high iron safe with a multiple-dial combination lock. The lock has 7 dials each with numbers ranging from 0 to 9. The combination cannot be changed while the door is open. The device weighs approximately 935 kg including its contents.

The door of SCP-216 can always be opened, but the accessible interior space appears to change depending on the currently entered combination. Objects placed inside SCP-216 may be accessed by re-entering the combination that was configured when the object was inserted. Objects retrieved from SCP-216 appear to be undamaged by the device.

It is speculated that every possible lock combination results in a different interior, and that there are therefore 10 million available compartments. It is unknown how many objects currently reside inside SCP-216.

Initial testing uncovered traces of sawdust inside compartment 0000000.

**Addendum:** 5/26: Dr. █████ Initial experiment log

**Test 1**
- Combination lock set to 6692724 and door opened. Compartment appears empty.
- 1 notebook and pencil placed inside and door closed.
- Combination lock set to 6692725 and door opened. Compartment appears empty.
- Combination lock re-set to 6692724 and door opened. Notebook and pencil retrieved from compartment.

Note: //"SCP appears to be a very efficient storage solution. May come in useful as a temporary or permanent replacement for the now inaccessible staff locker room on floor 6, following the events of [DATA EXPUNGED]."// - Dr █████

**Test 2**: Testing the effect of inserted items on the SCP's total weight
- Total weight of unit before inserting item: 935.877 kg
- Notebook and pencil (total weight 350 g) inserted into SCP-216 and door closed.
- Total weight of unit after inserting item: 936.057 kg

Expected weight: 936.217 kg
Actual weight: 936.057 kg
Difference: 160 g

Testing shows that SCP-216 takes on approximately 5.3% of the weight of its contents.
