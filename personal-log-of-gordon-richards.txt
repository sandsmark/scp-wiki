**Personal Log of:** Gordon Richards, member of Mobile team Zeta-9, the Mole Rats

**Date:** June 3rd, ████

Dispatched to the “Kowloon Walled City” to recover an object, and document anything affected by it.  I have never seen such a horrible place.  The filth is everywhere, whole walls and even structures made of garbage.  If you crack your suit for even a second, you get flooded by the smell of smoke, cooking, sweat, machine oil and excrement.  Henry fell into a pit used as a sewer on the ground level after breaking through a trash walkway.  He was fine, the suit was just filthy, but he threw up and had to be removed.  I’m not sure if he’s going to work out.  

Everyone here avoids us like the plague, or darts out to throw trash or insults.  They are a tribe, and a territorial one at that.  The sheer crush of humanity is intimidating, and I’m glad I have the suit between me and them.  The object is supposed to be somewhere in the core of this mass, but getting there is going to be tricky.

Local law enforcement led by Agents did a bunch of raids last night.  Cleared people out of some of the areas we need to go in, but there are so many people here it’s hard to notice any difference.  Yesterdays recon helped uncover a couple “homes” affected by this thing.  They don’t look like much, the same squalid homes as everyone else, but they are too big inside.  It’s an odd feeling, standing with your hand on the wall, and knowing that by all rights you should be six feet outside the structure, in mid-air.  Henry is better today, but seems really jumpy.  Lev took him aside and talked to him last night, and I hope it’s helped.  I’m getting worried about him.  Caught him muttering to himself over the radio today.  Told him to knock it off, but didn’t report it, maybe I should have.  I think I’m going to ask for him to be put on a different unit after this.

Deep recon this evening, we’re splitting up to try and hunt down where they are storing this thing.  Lev and I pulled the short stick and have to hike it around the sewer system.  Honestly, it can’t be any worse then topside; at least I won’t have to keep seeing the blank, empty faces of these people.
