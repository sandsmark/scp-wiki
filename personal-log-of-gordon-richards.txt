**Personal Log of:** Gordon Richards, member of Mobile team Zeta-9, the Mole Rats

**Date:** June 3rd, ████

Dispatched to the “Kowloon Walled City” to recover an object, and document anything affected by it.  I have never seen such a horrible place.  The filth is everywhere, whole walls and even structures made of garbage.  If you crack your suit for even a second, you get flooded by the smell of smoke, cooking, sweat, machine oil and excrement.  Henry fell into a pit used as a sewer on the ground level after breaking through a trash walkway.  He was fine, the suit was just filthy, but he threw up and had to be removed.  I’m not sure if he’s going to work out.  

Everyone here avoids us like the plague, or darts out to throw trash or insults.  They are a tribe, and a territorial one at that.  The sheer crush of humanity is intimidating, and I’m glad I have the suit between me and them.  The object is supposed to be somewhere in the core of this mass, but getting there is going to be tricky.

Local law enforcement led by Agents did a bunch of raids last night.  Cleared people out of some of the areas we need to go in, but there are so many people here it’s hard to notice any difference.  Yesterdays recon helped uncover a couple “homes” affected by this thing.  They don’t look like much, the same squalid homes as everyone else, but they are too big inside.  It’s an odd feeling, standing with your hand on the wall, and knowing that by all rights you should be six feet outside the structure, in mid-air.  Henry is better today, but seems really jumpy.  Lev took him aside and talked to him last night, and I hope it’s helped.  I’m getting worried about him.  Caught him muttering to himself over the radio today.  Told him to knock it off, but didn’t report it, maybe I should have.  I think I’m going to ask for him to be put on a different unit after this.

Deep recon this evening, we’re splitting up to try and hunt down where they are storing this thing.  Lev and I pulled the short stick and have to hike it around the sewer system.  Honestly, it can’t be any worse then topside; at least I won’t have to keep seeing the blank, empty faces of these people.

Henry is dead.  We didn’t get back until early this morning; we’d been off the radio for several hours because of all the interference.  It seems areas affected by this thing screw with radio waves pretty bad.  The sewer with a nightmare, but no sign of alteration by the item.  When we came back up, Paul gave me the news.  Henry and Paul were exploring near the center of the city, when they got attacked.  A mob of people swarmed them and dragged Henry off.  Paul was hurt and his suit was badly damaged, and he had to leave for medical attention.  Henry was screaming over the radio for a while, and then it cut off.  Paul and a couple other Mole Rats charged in with some agents to recover Henry, but after a few minutes, Henry came back on the radio.

His receiver was broken, but he could still broadcast.  One of the Agents was recording, and he played it back to Lev and I, to see if any of it made sense to us.  It didn’t.  He was rambling, and sounded like he was hurt.  Kept talking about the endless heart of the city, the hell of glass, just crazy stuff.  Paul and the rescue team kept trying to find him, but suddenly his radio cut out again.

Henry came tearing down one of those tiny halls, helmet off and screaming like a mad man.  He ran right by Paul and smashed an Agent into a wall on his way by.  He slammed into a dead end and just exploded through it, right out of the building.  He fell six stories onto some metal junk. it took a hour to get his body untangled.   We’re done screwing around here.  Agent Parks, Lev and me are rounding up what amounts to the city elders, and we’re getting to the damn bottom of this.
