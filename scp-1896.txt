**Item #:** SCP-1896

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** While in storage, the rope-portion of SCP-1896 should be coiled and fastened with a sturdy cable tie; a sealed plastic cover is sufficient protection for the tire-portion. The item is currently stored with the other Bonifay Family artifacts at Research Sector-09.   

**Description:** SCP-1896 is a crudely crafted swing consisting of a thick hemp rope (approx. 3m in length) tied to an automobile tire, probably manufactured in the 1920s.

If left unattended, SCP-1896 will fasten itself to an invisible anchorage. The the object will suspend itself by unknown means with the tire portion hanging 1m above the ground, the rope end looped as if encircling a support.

This phenomenon will not take place while a human subject is present in the room. However, video surveillance has revealed that, rather than levitating steadily, the rope-portion moves as if it is being tossed. This “toss” has even been observed to fail several times in succesion before the rope "lands" successfully, after which it quickly ties itself off.

Without outside interference, the anomaly will remain hanging indefinitely. Attempts to sever the rope while the object is suspended have been unsuccessful. The anchoring knot, however, can be unfastened by hand-- albeit with some difficulty. Repeated efforts have revealed that the object's apparent "support" is not only invisible but intangible: several subjects have extended an arm through the taut loop (approx. 35cm in diameter, consistently) without struggle or side-effect. 
 
While suspended, the anomalous swing has often been observed to rock and sway as if in response to a breeze, even while contained in a draftless room. On rarer occasions, the tire-portion will sag as if supporting weight, rocking at more measured intervals. If SCP-1896 is touched at this time, the "weight" will simply vanish and motions cease. 

Tests with subjects sitting or standing suspended on the object suggest that the anomalous "swing" is capable of temporarily distorting sensory perceptions. The intensity of these distortions increases in proportion to time spent in contact with the object.

**Test 1 (5-15 min)**
> **Procedure:** Subjects are seated in the center of SCP-1896 in its suspended state, or alternatively permitted to stand on the tire-portion while grasping the rope. Subjects are instructed to remain in the same position until the designated time has elapsed, and to describe any unusual sensations.
> * After spending 20-40 seconds seating/standing on the object, the majority of subjects reported feeling a slight breeze, despite the test taking place in a sealed room.  Three of the subjects described a sensation like sunlight; warmth with no accompanying brightness.  
> 
> * After 4 minutes elapsed, subject and object would begin a gentle swinging, either unconsciously instigated by the subjects themselves or the result of the anomalous breeze. 
> 
> * Almost exactly at the five minute mark, nine of the ten subjects tested visibly reacted to some stimulus invisible to research staff. The only subject who did not react was D-4399, a 35 year old male who has been deaf since birth. Notably, these reactions consistently took the form of positive facial cues: subjects glancing about the room attentively, several smiling or grinning.
> **Results:** All nine subjects, with the exception of D-4399 (who only experienced the tactile distortions), gave a similar report at the conclusion of the test. As time passed, each individual became less aware of the testing room, several describing the sensation as “being lost in thought”. The majority experienced the sensations of sun and wind, with several claiming to have heard the rustling of leaves or grass. 
> 
> When questioned about their visible reaction at the five minute mark, subjects described different sensations with a common theme. Some claimed to hear the distant sound of laughter, both child and adult’s; two described the sound of a woman’s voice, singing; a few heard children chanting, as if playing a game. 
> 
> It is noteworthy that the few test subjects who found these recollections frightening or disturbing did so only in retrospect; otherwise, subjects described their state of mind during the test as peaceful.      

**Test 2 (20-35 min)**
> **Procedure:** (as described in Test 1)
> * The first 20 minutes of the test proceed with the same results described in Test 1; after 30 minutes have elapsed, however, subjects grow markedly less responsive to audible or visual cues from research staff. 
> 
> * After breaking physical contact with the anomaly, subjects return to prior levels of responsiveness and communicativeness. 
> **Results:** Subjects described stronger and more varied sensations-- predominantly tactile and secondarily olfactory and audible. These recollections ranged from hearing the rustling of dry grasses or the sounds of insects to detecting the faint scent of smoke or wet earth. 
> 
> Subjects are unable to recall these details with any great specificity when it comes to comparing them to prior experiences; one particular subject claimed to hear “katydids” while in contact with SCP-1896, but could not recall ever having heard the sound before. 
> 
> Subjects reported the same sounds of laughter or singing in the distance, but unanimously claimed that these sounds had already faded away several minutes before the conclusion of the test. 

**Test 3 (45min-1hr)**
> **Procedure:** (as described in Test 1)
> * The first 35 minutes of the test elapse as previously described; however, without the interruption of a third party at the 35 minute mark, the subjects' unresponsiveness increased rapidly-- to the point of appearing catatonic. As the subject's body relaxed, the arc of SCP-1896's movement would increase. Regardless of this increase in speed and motion, none of the subjects ever appeared to be in danger of falling. 
> 
> * When between 50-55 minutes had elapsed, in the case of all ten subjects, the object's measured back-and forth motion would give way to erratic, slowing spirals. The motion would continue to slow until either the predetermined hour had passed or until it ceased altogether.
> 
> * Subjects remained unmoving and insensible until a second party made physical contact with SCP-1896, at which point some would fall forward, others startle-- as if waking from sleep. 
> **Results:** As established in Test 2, the longer contact with SCP-1896 was prolonged, the more vivid the subjects' sensory recollections would be. In the case of Test 3's subjects, however, individuals struggled with varying levels of difficulty to remember the experiences of the past hour. Sounds and smells of earth and grass were replaced with vague recollections of being under a tree in a wide field. Six of ten subjects recalled the smell and sight of burned grass. While five subjects claimed to have felt the sun, two distinctly remembered a damp heat and glimpses of thunderheads. 
> 
> One detail was consistent in all ten tests. At an unspecified point after the 35 minute mark, subjects claimed to have distinctly heard one of the voices which had taken the form of distant laughter, singing, or chanting earlier in the test. Some subjects heard the voice of a child, others a male or female adult-- but all ten described a voice calling out in close proximity. The following excerpt from the post-test interview with D-8526 typifies the subjects' descriptions of this encounter:
>> **D-8526:** //Yeah, I recognized her voice right away. I'm still positive it was woman's voice, maybe a little deeper than mine-- maybe older. It was the same woman I heard laughing before, only now she was calling someone.// [subject glances down, appearing perplexed] //No. I can't remember any words she was saying. But I knew she was calling for someone, and it made me feel -- like, did you ever play outside when you were a kid? And you'd get called in for supper-- and you'd just jump at that voice calling you in, whatever you were doing?// [subject shakes her head] //Whatever. It felt like that, sort of.//
>> 
>> //I don't know-- it wasn't my name she was calling, I'm pretty sure, but I still felt like I should answer.// [a pause; subject rubs a hand across her eyes] //I couldn't see who it was, but the voice kept coming closer-- and first it was impatient, like "get your ass in here, now!" But she just kept calling and no one answered, and she started to get more and more scared, and sounding like "please, please"...// [subject is visibly distressed, but collects herself] //...like helpless. And it sounded like she went right past me. I couldn't move, or see anyone. Then the voice just stopped.//

**Addendum:** 
A similar tire swing has been identified in ten of the twenty-six photographs contained in [[[SCP-1890]]]. Meticulous examination of these images (particularly the distinctive rubber tread, which does not correspond to any contemporary models) as well as the results of Test 3 strongly suggest that the object in containment and the object in the photographs are one in the same.
