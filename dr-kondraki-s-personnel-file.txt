**Profile:** Gruff, succinct, and not a fan of lab coats, Dr. Kondraki is an SCP Researcher working at Site 17, employed both as a scientist and a photographer for the Foundation. When not on assignment at Site 17, he usually toils away his time researching new optical technology and upgrading his camera. Despite no previous schooling in either field of knowledge, he seems to be doing well for himself. Some have regarded him as anti-social, and he has admitted that despite having worked at Site 17 for 5 years now, he can’t recall the name of a single co-worker. He has however expressed interest in working with [[[SCP-105]]] and her abilities, approval of which is under consideration. Dr. Kondraki has been observed to hold long conversations with [[[SCP-408]]] as well, but since █-██-████ the latter has seemingly ceased visual communication with the former. Alongside photography, his interests include fencing, writing, and classical music, which he regards as "the only kind worth listening to".


**History:** Dr. Kondraki signed on with the Foundation at the age of 35, joining as a low level researcher with little prospect of promotion. However, his finesse with a camera was quickly noticed, and since then he has become an avid photographer. Much of his time is spent accompaning agents out into the field, and photographically documenting new finds. After the discovery and containment of SCP-408, Dr. Kondraki was promoted to Level 3 Clearance, and is currently the head of research for SCP-408. Recently, he was commissioned to begin photographicly recording various SCP's, including several which are imperceivable to the human eye. Currently, he is working on [DATA EXPUNGED]. Until further notice, Dr. Kondraki will be stationed at Site 17.

__**Addendum:**__ Questions have been brought up regarding Dr. Kondraki's unusual talent detecting normally undetectable SCP's. Ever since the capture and containment of SCP-408, which had been completely invisible to accompanying agents, he has been privy to sensitive material above his security clearance, including the status of SCP-███ and the result of [DATA EXPUNGED]. More evidence of this fact was when asked to photograph SCP-126 given no previous knowledge of the subject, observed no issue with the task, and found to his surprise that his camera wasn't capable of the request. When asked about this inconsistency, he refused to answer directly, just stating "I just need a better camera". Detain him at Site 17 for a while, lets see if anything comes up.
