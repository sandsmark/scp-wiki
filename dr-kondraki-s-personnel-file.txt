**History:** Dr. Kondraki signed on with the Foundation at the age of 35, joining as a low level researcher with little prospect of promotion. However, his finesse with a camera was quickly noticed, and since then he has become an avid photographer. Much of his time is spent accompaning agents out into the field, and photographically documenting new finds. After the discovery and containment of [[[SCP-408]]], Dr. Kondraki was promoted to Level 3 Clearance, and is currently the head of research for SCP-408. Recently, he was commissioned to begin photographicly recording various SCP's, including several which are imperceivable to the human eye. Currently, he is working on [DATA EXPUNGED]. He has expressed interest in working with SCP-105 and her abilities, approval of which is under consideration. Until further notice, Dr. Kondraki will be stationed at Site 17.

Alongside photography, his interests include fencing, writing, and classical music, which he regards as "the only kind worth listening to".

__**SECURITY LEVEL 4 REQUIRED FROM THIS POINT ON.**__

Questions have been brought up regarding Dr. Kondraki's unusual talent detecting normally undetectable SCP's. Ever since the capture and containment of SCP-408, which had been completely invisible to accompanying agents, he has been privy to sensitive material above his security clearance, including the status of SCP-███ and the result of [DATA EXPUNGED]. More evidence of this fact was when asked to photograph [[[SCP-126]]], saw her clearly, and found to his surprise that his camera wasn't capable of the same feat. When asked about this inconsistency, he refused to answer directly, just stating "I just need a better camera". Detain him at Site 17 for a while, lets see if anything comes up.
