**Encounter #:** 35
**Roach Instance:** Ersatz Roach
**Personnel Name/Dept:** Dr. Inselmann
**Description:** Several deviations from SCP-723-J norms have been noted. Firstly, 'Ersatz' doesn't rhyme with 'sad.' But that appears to be a thing we're only marginally doing, anymore, so meh. Also, roach appears to be a ladybug, made to resemble a cockroach with a layer of paint.

> 
> **Dr. Inselmann:** You are no roach! You are an accursed beast of the Coccinellidae! You are full of lies, sir! Lies and aphids!
> 
> **Ersatz Roach:** (Dies of paint toxicity).
> 
> **Dr. Inselmann:** Ersatz Roach, nooo! Oh, what have I done! I repent! Take me instead, oh Lord! Ersatz Rooooaaach! (weeps inconsolably).
