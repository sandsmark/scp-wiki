**Item #:** SCP-126

**Object Class:** Safe/Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-126 is to be kept within Containment Cell #87816 at all times. Release or escape of SCP-126 will result in the immediate launch of Evacuation Procedure 44-S9, and the termination of accomplice(s). Only Level 3 personnel are permitted to enter Containment Cell #87816. Staff planning future personal contact with SCP-126 must go through mental training to avoid permanent emotional attachment. 

(Notice: For information regarding Evacuation Procedure 44-S9, please see Document 44-S9)

**Description:** SCP-126 bears no true physical appearance: for all intents and purposes, SCP-126 is an utterly invisible entity of unknown origins consisting only of a female voice. SCP-126 is sentient, with the ability to speak various human languages (and a number of unknown languages). SCP-126 has held multiple full-length conversations with personnel who have entered Containment Cell #87816 for extended research. 

She was found in a modern day, occupied house in [DATA EXPUNGED] that was described as haunted by the residents. After a series of agreements made with SCP-126, the entity deliberately decided to stay in Site-19. Although SCP-126 cannot be seen, footsteps can be heard clearly when she decides to move. 

Personnel that have held conversations with SCP-126 have commonly become extremely emotionally attached to her, talking as if they have known her for years. In a few notable cases, staff emotions have grown extreme enough to the point of love, regardless of gender or sexual preferences. These cases have resulted in multiple attempts to release SCP-126. Research has found emotional extremes are inevitable without proper mental therapy. Those who fall in love with SCP-126 have all died of starvation due to refusal to perform any action other than communication with SCP-126.

**Personality traits of SCP-126 include:**

* Arachnophobia
* Strong desire to help where and when it is needed
* Attraction to men who are intelligent and humorous
* Attachment to children

Although lacking any observable physical form, SCP-126 has not demonstrated the ability to pass through physical objects or barriers. SCP-126 appears to require no nourishment to survive.
