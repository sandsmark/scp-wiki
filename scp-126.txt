**Description:** SCP-126 bares no true physical appearance. It is a 100% invisible entity of unknown origins. Essentially it is that of a female voice. SCP-126 is sentient, with the ability to speak various human languages (and various unknown languages). SCP-126 has held multiple full length conversations with personnel that have entered Containment Cell #87816 for extended research. She was found in a modern day, occupied house in [DATA EXPUNGED] that was said to have been haunted by residence. After a series of agreements made with SCP-126, she deliberately proceeded to stay in Site 19. Although SCP-126 cannot be seen, footsteps can be heard clearly when she decides to move. Personnel that have had said conversations with SCP-126 have commonly become extremely emotionally attached to her, talking as if they have known her for years. In a few notable cases, staff emotions have grown extreme enough to the point of love, regardless of gender or sexual preferences. These cases have resulted in multiple attempts to release SCP-126. Research has found emotional extremes are imminent without proper mental therapy. Those who fall in love with SCP-126 have all died of starvation due refusal to perform any action other than communication with SCP-126.

**Personality traits of SCP-126 include:**

-Arachnophobia

-Strong desire to help where it is needed

-Attraction to men who are intelligent and humorous

-Attachment to children

Although seemingly lacking any physical form, SCP-126 has not attained the ability to phase through any physical objects. SCP-126 requires no nourishment to survive.
