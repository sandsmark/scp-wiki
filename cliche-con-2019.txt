------

The Cliché Contest is here! What does that mean?

> **Create an article (tale, SCP, or otherwise) that contains at least one (1) of the common clichés associated with the SCP-universe.**

This contest is meant to be a challenge - there is a reason that clichés are common pitfalls. However, we want to see you take these clichés and make them good, make them //work//. We're going to have a forum thread **__[*http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-9376136/cliche-con-2019-cliche-suggestion-thread right here]__** for users to suggest common clichés and pitfalls, and 10 will be chosen on December 21, 2018, before the posting period begins. Some good cliché ideas can be found [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/mackenzie-pitfalls here] and [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/the-big-list-of-overdone-scp-cliches here].

**There will be 3 categories for this contest:**

* Category 1 - Article features a cliché anomaly.
* Category 2 - Article features a cliché story element.
* Category 3 - Article features both a cliché anomaly and story element.
