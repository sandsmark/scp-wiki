+ __**The SCP Foundation Cliché Contest**__

++ Come one, come all, and get your common pitfalls ready!
[[/=]]

------

The Cliché Contest is here! What does that mean?

> **Create an article (tale, SCP, or otherwise) that contains at least one (1) of the common clichés associated with the SCP-universe.**

This contest is meant to be a challenge - there is a reason that clichés are common pitfalls. However, we want to see you take these clichés and make them good, make them //work//. We're going to have a forum thread **__[*http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-9376136/cliche-con-2019-cliche-suggestion-thread right here]__** for users to suggest common clichés and pitfalls, and 10 will be chosen on December 21, 2018, before the posting period begins. Some good cliché ideas can be found [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/mackenzie-pitfalls here], [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/t-2292297 here,] and [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/the-big-list-of-overdone-scp-cliches here].

**There will be 3 categories for this contest:**

* Category 1 - Article features a cliché anomaly.
* Category 2 - Article features a cliché story element.
* Category 3 - Article features both a cliché anomaly and story element.

__**5 Chosen Anomaly Clichés:**__

* Compulsion effect that makes you do bad things/kills you.[[footnote]] Compulsion effects have long been disliked on the Wiki for the reason that they completely override characters, forcing them into doing inexplicably dumb things. After all, isn't it much scarier to come to the conclusion that jumping in front of a moving truck is the best possible solution to your current problem, rather than being forced to do so? [[/footnote]]
* Spooky scary murder monster(s)![[footnote]] Exactly what it says on the tin. The anomaly is a monster with little drive or motive beyond survival (if animal) or evulz (if humanoid). [[/footnote]]
* An anomaly so helpful/harmless, the Foundation lets it roam the Site and has minimal containment procedures. Being helpful/harmless is optional.[[footnote]] Think along the lines of [[[SCP-999]]] and [[[SCP-073]]], two anomalies which are absolutely harmless and very useful respectively. Imagine something similarly benign or practical and apply it to today's Foundation, be it an object or a humanoid! [[/footnote]]
* A doorway of any shape to a different dimension/timeline/world.[[footnote]] Exactly what it says on the tin. This type of anomaly takes many shapes and forms and has literally nearly endless possibilities. This kind of article typically employs exploration logs, but don't feel obligated to include one. [[/footnote]]
* An item that is very good at doing the thing its supposed to do -- //too// good, in fact.[[footnote]] This kind of anomaly is typically something unassuming that performs its intended function but taken to its (il)logical extreme. Think along the lines of [[[SCP-2207]]], a knife so good that it can cut through realities. [[/footnote]]







__**5 Chosen Story Element Clichés:**__
* A highly skilled Mobile Task Force gets steamrolled.[[footnote]] Killing off characters that have been established as powerful and competent is a common and easy way to raise the stakes in a story, and is often shorthand for telling the audience that what the heroes are dealing with is likely beyond their capability. [[/footnote]]
* An interview in which the anomaly is overly cryptic, followed by the interviewer suffering.[[footnote]] The Foundation needs to interview an anomaly or subject for some reason, but much to their chagrin, the interviewee speaks in riddles or is extremely vague. Such interviews typically end up raising more questions than they answer and end poorly for the interviewer. [[/footnote]]
* (GoI/PoI here) gets one over the Foundation, making them look like fools in the process.[[footnote]] In this kind of article, the anomaly in question was either made by or is of interest to a particular GoI/PoI. Seeing as the Foundation likes to keep what they find, the GoI/PoIs are going to want to take it back; be it by force, trickery, or any other methods you can think of, they come out on top! [[/footnote]]
* Termination attempts.[[footnote]] The Foundation, for whatever reason, has decided that it is not interested in containing and protecting this anomaly, and is instead opting to destroy it. [[/footnote]]
* D-Class = Disposable Class[[footnote]]The anomaly goes through D-Class personnel like tissue paper, be it due to a dangerous property or testing purposes. [[/footnote]]
