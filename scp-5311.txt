**Item #:** SCP-5311

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to the widespread nature of SCP-5311, containment consists of removing footage taken of SCP-5311-1 instances, and the development of an algorithm to assist with predicted manifestation to support containment efforts. 

Instances of SCP-5311-1, when discovered, are to be detained until demanifestation, with vehicles returned under guise of local law enforcement action by embedded personnel.

**Description:** SCP-5311 is a phenomena sporadically affecting Taxicab services across the continental United States, in which food items and other edible substances left within the interior of a parked or unattended Taxicab will become briefly animate and conglomerate[[footnote]]In the event there is not enough edible material to form an SCP-5311-1 instance, food items already present will proceed to duplicate until enough material has been generated. The source of this material remains unknown at this time[[/footnote]]into a single humanoid shape located in the driver's seat, which results in the creation of an SCP-5311-1 instance.

SCP-5311-1 instances will then proceed to operate their respective vehicle accurately and accordingly to state laws and regulations within their area of manifestation, operating in a manner similar to non-anomalous Taxicab services already present in the immediate area.

Persons utilizing Taxicab services operated by SCP-5311-1 instances do not appear to notice the anomalous appearance of SCP-5311-1 instances, and will instead carry on a one-sided conversation with the instance for the duration of the ride[[footnote]]Topics have ranged from sports, local politics and the quality of restaurant fare along the route taken by the instance[[/footnote]].

Once a passenger has arrived at the indicated destination, when they attempt to pay the resulting fare, SCP-5311-1 instances will physically refuse payment, and instead remove an edible item[[footnote]]Items have included wrapped sandwiches, various snack foods and canned or bottled beverages. Testing of these items indicates no unusual ingredients.[[/footnote]]from their body mass, which they will then present to them before driving off. 

SCP-5311-1 instances typically operate for between seven and nine hours at a time, before parking their respective vehicles to the nearest available parking space, and demanifesting into a pile of loose, edible materials.
