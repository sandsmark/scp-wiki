[[size 125%]] **Special Containment Procedures:** [[/size]]

The Foundation is to continue funding the production of television court and police drama shows to normalize the processes of the legal system in Oneiroi West. Stationary Task Force Phi-23 ("Dream Defense") are currently stored in Site-107's Extended Deep-Sleep Facility. Auxiliary personnel is to observe coma-patient procedures on active Phi-23 members.

While SCP-4917-A entities cannot be contained, three D-Class are to be placed in a medically-induced coma and instructed to commit infractions and minor misdemeanors to occupy the instances from appearing in civilians' dreams. The D-Class additionally should be monitored for REM sleep activity and defended by STF Phi-23 in dream court to prevent incarceration.

Should any problems arise in the condition of D-Class or Phi-23 members, contact either Site Director Pilliken or the head researcher on SCP-4917 (currently Dr. Fynegan). Any D-Class tested will undergo an infirmary checkup before and after exposure to SCP-4917.

[[size 125%]] **Description:** [[/size]]

SCP-XXXX is the law enforcement and judicial systems of the Oneiroi West noosphere. If a person commits a crime while sleeping and within the Oneiroi West collective, they will be apprehended by humanoid law enforcement entities (designated SCP-4917-A) and given a criminal sentence in a court trial (designated SCP-4917-B) in accordance with Oneiroi dream law[[footnote]]Most closely resembling the United States justice system.[[/footnote]].

SCP-4917-A entities are usually not present in the host's dream until they commit a crime, where the host becomes designated SCP-4917-1. SCP-4917-1 will be continually pursued in their dreams by the -A entities until 4917-1 wakes or is caught. If 4917-1 wakes up, the next time they fall asleep the -A entities will continue the pursuit of the host; when they are caught, they are detained for their crimes committed inside the dream. The longest known evasion of the entities was 2 nights.

SCP-4917-A entities are commonly described as wearing the apparel of a 1970s/1980s motorcycle officer[[footnote]]Black leather motorcycle jacket, police trooper belt, white-black police motorcycle helmet, trooper boots.[[/footnote]], a seven-point star badge, and Aviator-style sunglasses. Other more detailed descriptions have suggested they wear Dehner boots[[footnote]]A common motorcycle officer trooper boot.[[/footnote]], ride Moto Guzzi Californias[[footnote]]As identified by a motorcycle enthusiast.[[/footnote]], and carry Colt Python revolvers. The entities have, to our current knowledge, never used lethal force on any SCP-4917-1 instances. 

The SCP-4917-B event usually occurs within several nights after the detainment of the SCP-4917-1 instances. SCP-4917-1 will be called to court and given their choice of defense. Most SCP-4917-1 instances are forced to defend themselves, but recently STF Phi-23 has offered free services to any 4917-1 instances. SCP-4917-1 will fall asleep for periods of up to ten hours to attend their court hearing.[[footnote]]This hearing is typically attended by SCP-4917-A instances and civilians randomly selected from the Collective serve as jurors.[[/footnote]] SCP-4917-1 instances are allowed on to post bail and be on parole, and Phi-23 is authorized to act as bail bondsmen for any 4917-1 instances: the currency used must be in Oneiroi dream dollars. However, when an SCP-4917-1 instance is on parole, they will not be able to dream for the duration of their parole.

The sentencing for crimes committed by SCP-4917-1 instances has ranged from a lecture (jaywalking) to firing squad execution (for serial murder). SCP-4917-1 instances who have been sentenced will enter a dream state where the host is jailed for the full duration of the sentence given. During this dream state, SCP-4917-1 instances will usually fall into a coma-like state: the most extreme case led to a brain-dead patent. 

Once SCP-4917-1 has completed their criminal sentence, they will be able to wake up and resume normal brain function. SCP-4917-1 instances are more vigilant and self-disciplined when regarding potential law-breaking actions, thought to be a result of SCP-4917's disciplinary measures within the instances' dream.

[[size 125%]] **Item History:** [[/size]]

SCP-4917 was discovered on 08/04/2018 after Agent Kabasic and Agent Goggins reported an unusually high ingoing/outgoing rate of coma patients at Ogeney General Hospital. Once it was discovered that SCP-4917 was a common factor among the patients, the town was quarantined pending further evaluation of information. [[footnote]]The town since has been released from Foundation control. [[/footnote]] Initial descriptions of the SCP-4917-A entities and SCP-4917-B were recorded, but until SCP-4917 testing commenced they were not confirmed. The Foundation has reached terms with Oneiroi West to adhere to a standardized "dream law".

STF Phi-23 ("Dream Defense") was created to combat the high incarceration rate of SCP-4917-1 instances. Phi-23 is staffed with several accredited defense lawyers to represent -1 instances: most cases taken by Phi-23 are found not guilty or a given a reduced sentence.

[[size 125%]] **Addendum 01:** Interview of SCP-4917-A Instances[[/size]]

The following interview was conducted with the instructions of the Foundation and conducted by Junior Researcher Shipherd. Shipherd was placed in a medically-induced sleep and instructed to commit a mundane crime and subsequently attempt to ascertain the purpose of the -A entities. The interview is completely transcribed from memory and thus may be incorrect in certain places.

> 
> **SCP-4917-A-1:** An unforgivable one.
> 
> **SCP-4917-A-2:** Indeed.
> 
> **Shipherd:** Trespassing? On Oneiroi property? Bullshit. I'll call up Phi-23.

> 
> **Shipherd:** What? 
> 
> **SCP-4917-A-2:** We've been monitoring you for a bit. The people dream about you all, sometimes. Sometimes other things.
> 
> **SCP-4917-A-1:** We saw your other folks as well, but you're... different. One of the higher guys, I assume.

> **Shipherd:** We're just trying to figure out who.., well, //what// you are. And why you do what you do.

> 
> **SCP-4917-A-2:** It is for us, as well. We're officers. We're just trying to keep it clean here. Some of our efforts trickle up to you. Consider it a bonus. 
> 
> **Shipherd:** You both are aware that when you sentence a person, they enter an unwakeable state, right? I'd hardly call that a bonus.

> **Closing Statement:** Junior Researcher Shipherd was woken up without any loss of brain function. Regular checkups indicate that Shipherd, despite committing a crime, is not being actively pursued by SCP-4917-A instances. Further investigation into communications with the entities themselves in Oneiroi West is underway.
