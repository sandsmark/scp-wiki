> **Phenomenon:** 
> 
> **Description:** 
> 
> **Analogue in Current Reality:**

A summary description of Occult War //i// is as follows: 

> A global war occurring throughout the 19th century Anno Domini, coalesced from three separate conflicts in Europe (Napoleonic War), East Asia (Daevite conquest) and North America (American Civil War). It is also notable for overt use of anomalous objects, leading to an IK-class Global Civilisation Collapse scenario.

++ Europe and Russia

> **Phenomenon:** UnLondon Proposal 
> 
> **Description:** A evacuation plan was presented to the British Parliament by Her Majesty's Foundation for the Secure Containment of the Paranormal, whereby the populace of London shall be evacuated to an underground shelter in light of potential French invasion of the British Isles. Proposal was rejected due to its impracticality and relative ease of alternative evacuation to Ireland and other dominions. 
> 
> **Analogue in Current Reality:** UnLondon Proposal was not presented to the British Parliament. However, the term 'UnLondon' is used as a referent for [[[SCP-1678]]]. 

> **Phenomenon:** Uralic Front 
> 
> **Description:** A series of battles in the Ural Mountains between the French-led Continental System and Daevite Empire. Russia joined the Continental System during this period, primarily offering assistance via the House of Romanov's pact with a Grigori.

> **Phenomenon:** The Islamic Republic of Eastern Skanta
> 
> **Description:** A political body formed from the refugees from the ruins of Skanta, a small town near London, arrived to a new land to escape the war called the Islamic Republic of Eastern Skanta. The Republic was well known for its memetic anomalies, which they would use to assist the Her Majesty's Foundation for the Secure Containment of the Paranormal.
> 
> **Analogue in Current Reality:** According to SCP-████, the Islamic Republic of Eastern Skanta contracted an anti-memetic virus, which began to destroy the concept of the Republic itself. It is said that the Council that governed the Republic enacted an emergency protocol to [[[scp-1173|change the republic's name]]] from every single recorded item referencing them, thus making them immune from further metaphysical manipulation.

> **Phenomenon:** Phélippeaux's Crisis 
> 
> **Description:** An eruption originated from a crater in French Levant, spawning numerous entities which later attacked locals and occupying French forces. Some entities were captured by the French for undetermined purposes. 
> 
> **Analogue in Current Reality:** Did not occur. Instead, French Col. Picard de Phélippeaux augmented containment of [[[SCP-1844]]] as per Napoleon's orders. 

> **Phenomenon:** Evacuation of Tehran 
> 
> **Description:** Amidst a surprise Daevite assault into Tehran, 90% of the city's populace evacuated the city. Shah Naser al-Din was able to escape with the aid of golems summoned by the city's rabbinic community and an ancestral //takwin//.
> 
> **Analogue in Current Reality:** The aforementioned //takwin// is believed to be [[[SCP-2067]]], in which Shah Naser al-Din is believed to be aware of. No known evacuation of Tehran's populace has been noted thus far. 

> **Phenomenon:** Invasion of Yajuj and Majuj
> 
> **Description:** Following a failed invasion of the Ottoman Empire, retreating Daevite forces intentionally destroyed the Iron Wall of Dhul-Qarnayn, triggering an invasion of the Middle East by the forces of 'Yajuj and Majuj.' After suffering heavy losses, the Ottoman army repelled the invaders and rebuilt the Iron Wall of Dhul-Qarnayn with the assistance of Neo-Gnostic engineers from the Kingdom of Ionia, a French client state.
> 
> **Analogue in Current Reality:** The Iron Wall of Dhul-Qarnayn is contained as [[[SCP-2309]]], and no known breach has ever taken place.

++ North America 

> **Phenomenon:** Strannik's Testimony  
> 
> **Description:** A testimony obtained from Vladimir Strannik, a white human with the ability to travel to different points in history while asleep (designated as Phenomenon 2896-012 by the American Secure Containment Initiative [ASCI]). Strannik claims that the general populace have no recollection of Occult War //i// in the 20th century and beyond. 
> 
> **Analogue in Current Reality:** Strannik is contained as [[[SCP-2896]]]. The claim of no recollection among the general populace is believed to be due to a CK-class restructuring event.

> **Phenomenon:** Navajo Nation 
> 
> **Description:** A Navajo nation-state formed following [[[SCP-2155|Cem Anáhuac's]]] invasion of Texas. Members of the Navajo Nation possess the anomalous ability to alter its appearance into that of various animal species, which is believed to have contributed to the Navajo's resistance against Cem Anáhuac. As such, ASCI has rounded up significant portions of the Navajo population for experimentation to identify measures against mental malady created by Cem Anáhuac.
> 
> **Analogue in Current Reality:** Semi-autonomous Native American territory formed after the Treaty of 1868. [[[SCP-2750]]] population has been decimated due to the policies of the ASCI.

> **Phenomenon:** Gerald's General Goods
> 
> **Description:** A small but formidable group formed after the complete disbanding of Marry, Catherine, and Duke's trade goods. The group was designed to create anomalies and to supply them to people for a price. Gerald Nakelo, the leader of the group, was reported to have created a book that, once weekly, would inform him of a way to create an anomaly, and how to control it after creation.
> 
> **Analogue in Current Reality:** Group was disbanded shortly after being founded, but did create a [[[ SCP-2305| failed prototype of the book]]] before disbanding, which has since been heavily altered by another entity. 

> **Phenomenon:** Preacher of the Cicada
> 
> **Description:** A middle-aged man walked North America during the height of the American Civil War. He would walk to family gatherings and deliver a speech of hope, attempting to ensure everyone that everybody would survive the war. Persons at the gatherings would offer gifts in a basket that he brought, so he may offer them as tribute to the Cicada Lord.
> 
> **Analogue in Current Reality:** According to the confiscated text [REDACTED], the Cicada Lord was supposedly furious at the Preacher sometime during his servitude. He then shed the man's skin, and allowed his spawn to manifest in the empty skin. [[[SCP-2852|The puppet]]] is said to wander around North America, giving speeches of "hope" to the participants of family gatherings.

> **Phenomenon:** Civil Rights Act of 1866
> 
> **Description:** A bill signed into law by the U.S. Congress. Anomalous elements in the bill's text caused 3.2 million human beings with non-standard anatomical features to manifest in cities controlled by the Union. A majority of the humanoids were forcibly drafted into the Union Army after initial containment efforts by the ASCI were met with failure.
> 
> **Analogue in Current Reality:** The bill was vetoed by President Johnson and a non-anomalous revision was introduced to the U.S. Senate by embedded ASCI agents. Copies of the original bill are currently in storage, [[[SCP-2354|though it is believed that other copies currently exist outside containment.]]]

> **Phenomenon:** Later Qin Dynasty 
> 
> **Description:** A Chinese state located in central China, founded after the Daevite's occupation of Shaanxi Province, China. Despite being surrounded by Daevite-occupied territories, the Later Qin has maintained independence. Rumours alleged that it is ruled by a figure named 'Qin Shi Huang'; it is unknown if it is indeed Qin Shi Huang (first emperor of the Qin Dynasty) or a person using the name 'Qin Shi Huang'.  
> 
> **Analogue in Current Reality:** No such polity is known to exist. [[[SCP-2101]]] is to be monitored at all times and the Foundation is to offer support to SCP-2101-1 instances in the containment of the former. 

> **Phenomenon:** Legend of Silent Wind
