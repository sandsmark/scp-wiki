> **Phenomenon:** 
> 
> **Description:** 
> 
> **Analogue in Current Reality:**

A summary description of Occult War //i// is as follows: 

> A global war occurring throughout the 19th century Anno Domini, coalesced from three separate conflicts in Europe (Napoleonic War), East Asia (Daevite conquest) and North America (American Civil War). It is also notable for overt use of anomalous objects, leading to an IK-class Global Civilisation Collapse scenario.

> **Phenomenon:** UnLondon Proposal 
> 
> **Description:** A evacuation plan presented to the British Parliament by Her Majesty's Foundation for the Secure Containment of the Paranormal, whereby the populace of London shall be evacuated to an underground shelter in light of potential French invasion of the British Isles. Proposal was rejected due to its impracticality and relative ease of alternative evacuation to Ireland and other dominions. 
> 
> **Analogue in Current Reality:** UnLondon Proposal was not presented to the British Parliament. However, the term 'UnLondon' is used as a referent for [[[SCP-1678]]]. 

> **Phenomenon:** Uralic Front

> **Phenomenon:** Phélippeaux's Crisis 
> 
> **Description:** An eruption originated from a crater in French Levant, spawning numerous entities which later attacked locals and occupying French forces. Some entities were captured by the French for undetermined purposes. 
> 
> **Analogue in Current Reality:** Did not occur. Instead, French Col. Picard de Phélippeaux augmented containment of [[[SCP-1844]]] as per Napoleon's orders. 

> **Phenomenon:** Evacuation of Tehran 
> 
> **Description:** Amidst a surprise Daevite assault into Tehran, 90% of the city's populace evacuated the city. Shah Naser al-Din was able to escape with the aid of golems summoned by the city's rabbinic community and an ancestral //takwin//.
> 
> **Analogue in Current Reality:** The aforementioned //takwin// is believed to be [[[SCP-2067]]], in which Shah Naser al-Din is believed to be aware of. No known evacuation of Tehran's populace has been noted thus far. 

> **Phenomenon:** Invasion of Yajuj and Majuj
> 
> **Description:** Following a failed invasion of the Ottoman Empire, retreating Daevite forces intentionally destroyed the Iron Wall of Dhul-Qarnayn, triggering an invasion of the Middle East by the forces of 'Yajuj and Majuj.' After suffering heavy losses, the Ottoman army repelled the invaders and rebuilt the Iron Wall of Dhul-Qarnayn with the assistance of Neo-Gnostic engineers from the Kingdom of Ionia, a French client state.
> 
> **Analogue in Current Reality:** The Iron Wall of Dhul-Qarnayn is contained as [[[SCP-2309]]], and no known breach has ever taken place.

> 
> **Description:** A testimony obtained from Vladimir Strannik, a white human with the ability to travel to different points in history while asleep (designated as Phenomenon 2896-012 by the American Secure Containment Initiative [ASCI]). Strannik claims that the general populace have no recollection of Occult War //i// in the 20th century and beyond. 
>

> **Phenomenon:** Navajo Nation 
> 
> **Description:** A Navajo nation-state formed following [[[SCP-2155|Cem Anáhuac's]]] invasion of Texas. Members of the Navajo Nation possess the anomalous ability to alter its appearance into that of various animal species, which is believed to have contributed to the Navajo's resistance against Cem Anáhuac. As such, ASCI has rounded up significant portions of the Navajo population for experimentation to identify measures against mental malady created by Cem Anáhuac.
> 
> **Analogue in Current Reality:** Semi-autonomous Native American territory formed after the Treaty of 1868. [[[SCP-2750]]] population has been decimated due to the policies of the ASCI.

> 
> **Analogue in Current Reality:** No such polity is known to exist. [[[SCP-2101]]] is to be monitored at all times and the Foundation is to offer support to SCP-2101-1 instances in the containment of the former. 

> **Phenomenon:** Legend of Silent Wind 
> 
> **Description:** A folk legend originated from contemporary Jiangsu Province, China. It revolves around an eponymous martial artist who died protecting a village from a Daevite regiment. The corpse of 'Silent Wind' was never found.
