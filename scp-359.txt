**Item #:** SCP-359

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-359 is to be monitored at all times via a radio tracking band fastened to its leg.  Due to its proximity to a major public thoroughfare, a proper containment site could not be constructed. Any interaction with SCP-359 is to be conducted during daylight hours, preferably between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m.  

**Description:** SCP-359 appears to be a metal sculpture of a red-tailed hawk (//Buteo jamaicensis//) with a wingspan of approximately 4.3 m, perched atop a 12 meter arch just south of █████████, ████ in the United States.  During daylight hours (approx. 6:00 a.m.-9:00 p.m. local standard time), it displays no signs of movement and does not respond to any external stimuli.  However, it has recently been determined by the foundation that between the hours of 9:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. it displays the typical behaviors of an adult red-tailed hawk, apart from being nocturnal.  SCP-359 is apparently capable of flight - the mechanisms through which it accomplishes this have not been determined, as its wings are too short to allow for flight.  

SCP-359 first came to the Foundation's attention when local foresters began finding dead bodies of white-tailed deer (//Odocoileus virginianus//) in the area within a 1km radius of the sculpture, which looked to have been preyed upon.  The white-tailed deer has no natural predators in the state of ████.  Investigation officially began on [DATA EXPUNGED] when motorists on the stretch of State Route ██ that passes by SCP-359 reported that the hawk was not on top of the arch.  On the same day, a local farmer reported finding the sculpture in his field, standing over the body of one of his cows, which had injuries consistent with predation by a large bird of prey.  The farmer was administered a Class A Amnesiac and fed the story that the cow had died of natural causes, and its body eaten by coyotes.

When under direct observation by Foundation personnel, SCP-359 seems to be ignorant of their presence unless directly confronted, at which point it acts defensively.  Three D-class personnel have been seriously injured trying to restrain SCP-359.  So far, SCP-359 is not believed to have attacked humans for food.

When mobile, SCP-359 appears to change its physical composition, as any attempts to attach a magnetic tracker have failed, despite SCP-359 being magnetic during the day.

**Addendum 359-1:** On 21 December, ████, SCP-359 began movement three hours earlier than usual.  D-class personnel [DATA EXPUNGED], who was attempting to make repairs to the tracking device at the time, was attacked.  Ornithologists say SCP-359's behavior was consistent with that of a female red-tailed hawk defending her nest.  SCP-359 resumed its normal schedule the following day.
