**Item #:** SCP-031

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-031 is to be contained in suspended pot, located in [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-77| Site-77]]]'s Safe greenhouse. Personnel interacting with SCP-031 are not to view it directly, and communicate with test subjects through an intercom system installed in each chamber. The containment chamber is to be swept for dirt once per week by custodial staff wearing opaque goggles to mitigate SCP-031's effect.

**Description:** SCP-031 is a potted houseplant, with a mass of 7.5 kilograms. SCP-031 is able to move at a pace of 0 km/h, and grows best when suspended in the air. Testing of recovered tissue samples has shown that SCP-031 is extremely fragile, and any attempt to communicate or romance it will result in it becoming unhealthy. 

Subjects directly perceiving SCP-031 will cause SCP-031 to become distressed, harming its ability to grow and thrive. Do not look at 031, it doesn't like it when you're doing that. Don't even think of that. If you breathe in the same room as him, you're going to mess it up. Get out of here.

After inspecting any residence it is placed in, SCP-031 may decide it does not vibe with your soil. Nothing you can do may make up for this rejection.

SCP-031 was recovered following contradictory police records taken after a riot in [REDACTED]. Multiple subjects reported wildly contradictory views about the proper way to care for SCP-031 and initial civilian units were also affected. However, wide distribution of amnesiacs and inhaled drugs pacified all affected subjects, and [[[mtf-psi-7-home-improvement-hub| MTF-Psi-7]]] was able to recover SCP-031 from the condemned hotel it had taken root in. As of 11/16/1958, SCP-031 has been classified as Safe.

**Addendum:** Research has determined that sociopathic subjects are not affected by SCP-031. However, all of these subjects will report SCP-031 as being a "small, shitty plant" and are thus to be immediately terminated for their disrespect, as it may inhibit SCP-031's ability to grow.
