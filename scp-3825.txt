**Item #:** SCP-3825

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3825 is to be contained in the lowest sub-basement level at Site-15, in an enlarged humanoid containment unit. In order to reduce the risk of potential structural damage, SCP-3825 is not to be moved to any area that is not directly supported by solid ground or specially reinforced floors, such as the upper floors of any buildings on-site. 

Investigation into the whereabouts of PoI-3825-1 are ongoing. If possible, PoI-3825-1 is to be captured and brought to Site-15 for interrogation.

**Description:** SCP-3825 is the collective designation for an adult human male and the mass of inert copies of itself it continually generates. SCP-3825 appears as a conglomeration of adult male human bodies physically merged with one another to form a solid mass of human tissue. Each of these copied bodies is referred to as an instance of SCP-3825-1. SCP-3825-1 physically resemble adult male human bodies, but are inert and show no signs of life functions. At the “front” of this mass is a live human male known as SCP-3825-2, which moves, speaks, and behaves identically to a non-anomalous human. 

SCP-3825-2 continually and involuntarily generates instances of SCP-3825-1, identical in appearance to SCP-3825-2, that merge into each other to form the bulk of SCP-3825. These copies appear as “freeze-frames” of how SCP-3825-2 was positioned at the time of their generation. Although SCP-3825-1 appear tangible to outside interaction, SCP-3825-2 can physically pass through SCP-3825-1 instances, allowing more instances to be formed “inside” previous instances. This stacking occurs seamlessly, and results in an increased mass density within the overlap. 

Analysis has determined that each SCP-3825-1 instance manifests for a total of thirty seconds before demanifesting, and as the oldest instance demanifests, a new instance is simultaneously created from SCP-3825-2. SCP-3825-2 generates SCP-3825-1 ten times per second, making the total conglomeration of SCP-3825-1 consist of 300 instances at any given time. Each instance possesses a mass of approximately 85 kilograms, placing the full mass of SCP-3825 at over 25 metric tons. The density of this mass depends on the rate at which SCP-3825-2 changes its geographic location, and can quickly reach structurally hazardous levels when SCP-3825-2 stands still.

**Recovery:** SCP-3825 was discovered in 20██ after several floors of the ████ Laboratory in ████, New York suddenly collapsed, creating a series of holes leading to its basement. Foundation agents embedded in emergency services were some of the first on-scene, and discovered SCP-3825, injured but alive, lying atop a pile of rubble in the basement beneath the collapsed floors. The rubble had been largely crushed into gravel and splinters by SCP-3825’s substantial weight. Civilian first responders were amnesticized, and a cover story about improper adherence to building codes was distributed to the public.

> **Interviewer:** Dr. Swicker
> **Interviewed:** SCP-3825-2
> **Date:** 09/01/20██
> **Notes:** This interview was conducted one week after SCP-3825’s transport to Site-15, once SCP-3825-2 had recovered from its injuries. 
> 
> **<Begin log>**
> 
> **Dr. Swicker:** Good afternoon, SCP-3825-2. How’s your leg feeling?
> 
> **SCP-3825-2:** Not bad, all things considered. I mean, I fell through what, four floors? I guess I’m lucky I’m not a paraplegic. Ribs are still killing me though. Did you guys ever get in touch with my insurance? I dunno if my plan covers… well, whatever you’d call this situation. 
> 
> **Swicker:** That won’t be necessary. All medical expenses are free of charge while you’re under our jurisdiction. 
> 
> **3825-2:** Good, ‘cause I’m pretty broke right now. Do me a favor and tell ████ Labs that if they think they’re sticking me with the repair charges on their building, they can blow me. Tell them to take that up with Arnold. 
> 
> **Swicker:** Arnold?
> 
> **3825-2:** Yeah, Dr. Arnold ████████. Did I not tell you about him? Maybe that was a fever dream or something. You guys have really powerful morphine. 
> 
> **Swicker:** I don’t believe you did. Could you explain?
> 
> **3825-2:** Yeah, sure. ████████ was the guy I was interning with, over at ████ Labs. He was a professor at ███, you can probably find him if you look him up. He’s the one to blame for this damn mess.
> 
> **Swicker:** I’d like you to start at the beginning, if possible. Do you know what caused your current condition, or when it first manifested?
> 
> **3825-2:** If it’ll help you figure out how to fix it, sure. Did I tell you about my job search and all that?
> 
> **Swicker:** You didn’t. That sounds like a good place to begin.
> 
> **3825-2:** Alright, well, I’m sure you government spooks already know that I’m a grad student over at ███. I’ve been trying to get my Master’s in nuclear physics, and I needed some more research experience if I wanted to have any shot at landing a job later on. And lemme tell you, it’s not easy to find an internship when you graduated with a 2.7 GPA. 
> 
> **Swicker:** I assume that’s how you got in touch with Dr. ████████. 
> 
> **3825-2:** Yup. The internship wanted people with “a background in physics and a willingness to learn”, according to the description online. It was pretty vague with the details of what he was studying, but the guy seemed credible enough among the academic types, and beggars can’t be choosers. So I sent in an application, and a month later got a reply saying I was in. I started working with him a couple weeks after that.
> 
> **Swicker:** Can you describe exactly what you were researching? Who else was in your team?
> 
> **3825-2:** Him and I //were// the team, which really was the first red flag. He had a few technicians come in every now and again to install equipment, but we did most of the design and calculation ourselves. The second red flag was when he started calling himself a “chronologist”, which is both a word I’m pretty sure he made up, and a title he gave to himself. He had me sign a confidentiality agreement, but I think that’s out the window now.
> 
> //SCP-3825-2 scratches its head and pauses.//
> 
> **3825-2:** The details are hazy, because he’s about as entertaining as watching static on TV and I hardly ever paid attention. From what I remember of his constant lectures, he claimed he had found a way to conduct honest-to-god time travel. Kept blabbering about eigenvectors and the Runge-Kutta method, which just seemed like his attempt to make me think he knew what he was talking about by throwing around buzzwords. I doubt the guy had done any actual phase-plane analysis in his damn life. I just crunched the numbers when he told me to, kept my mouth shut.
> 
> **Swicker:** You had a lot of doubts, but you stuck with the research anyway?
> 
> **3825-2:** I mean, yeah, I thought the guy was a hack, but he never struck me as actually dangerous. I needed to pad out my resume somehow, and employers don’t really care if your internship actually accomplished anything big. Even when he asked me to be the test subject for his machine, I figured the worst it’d do is zap me with some electricity and I could sue him for on-the-job injury. Arrogant bastard didn’t even make me sign a waiver. I guess the thought of his experiment failing was unfathomable. Not unfathomable enough for him to step into the chamber, though.
> 
> **Swicker:** This machine being what he believed would allow “time-travel”?
> 
> **3825-2:** Yeah. I don’t remember how it worked mechanically, so sorry about that. But I remember how he thought it would work.
> 
> **Swicker:** Do tell.
> 
> **3825-2:** Apparently ████████ was big into Vonnegut, because he believed that “time” as the fourth dimension was something that we, as people, exist on at all points at once. Like an axis extending forever in both directions, and we have a physical form that exists in three-dimensional space at every single instant along that axis. His “theory”, and I use that term lightly because it was more like a fantasy, was that human consciousness travels at a fixed velocity in the fourth axis, time, constantly jumping from body to body in three-dimensional space at a constant rate. Like, one second per second or something. The idea of his machine was to reverse and accelerate this vector, letting the consciousness move backwards along the axis and re-enter a physical form from an earlier time. If it sounds like horseshit, it’s because it is. As you can tell.
> 
> //SCP-3825-2 gestures to the masses of SCP-3825-1 gathered around it.//
> 
> **Swicker:** So, this machine theoretically didn’t allow an adult to go back in time and meet themselves as an infant.
> 
> **3825-2:** Right. According to him, this was how he got around the whole “causality loop” thing. The machine didn’t move your physical form back through time. It just jumped your consciousness, with all its current memories and personality and stuff, back into the body you inhabited in the past. Time travel of the mind, not the body, he said. So basically, you can go back to the years of you being an infant, but you’d be a really, really smart infant.
> 
> **Swicker:** And what of your body in the present? 
> 
> **3825-2:** Yeah, I asked him about that, too. He said that to all outside observers, meaning anyone not using the machine, the reality of the present would shift to match whatever changes we make in the past. Instantaneously, and without their knowing. So I ask him, “what if that leads to us never building the machine?” and he just started rambling about Lagrange polynomials and whatever else he could remember from his undergrad differential equations courses. That was his way of saying “I don’t know, but I’m going to try to make it seem like I do”.
> 
> **Swicker:** I think I follow. Tell me about this first test, if you would.
> 
> **3825-2:** Right, after around four months of work, he has me step into the main chamber of the machine for an early test. Thirty seconds into the past. Oh, and before you ask me, I don’t know where he got the funding for all this crap. Probably blood diamonds or something. I didn’t feel like asking.
> 
> **Swicker:** Understood. Please continue.
> 
> **3825-2:** So I step into the machine, expecting a lot of humming and buzzing and maybe a few painful jolts of electricity, but definitely no time travel. He tells me “I’ll set h to point one to keep energy consumption low”. I remember that part vividly. Then he threw the switch, there was a bright flash, and then I was falling through the floor. Hit the basement, blacked out, you know the rest. When I woke up, I was with you guys. 
> 
> **Swicker:** The experiment obviously didn’t go as planned.
> 
> **3825-2:** Goddamn right it didn’t! Fucking phony had no idea what he was doing. He was just throwing concepts and ideas and tech together until he made something resembling a prototype. Shoulda left when I had the chance. 
> 
> **Swicker:** Do you have any idea what might have caused the machine to bring you to your current state?
> 
> **3825-2:** Your guess is as good as mine, but I’ll chalk it up to ████████ being an arrogant jackass who was dabbling in shit he didn’t have a clue about. And I just happened to be his lab rat. Speaking of which, will you be able to find ████████? 
> 
> **Swicker:** We'll begin the search immediately. 
> 
> **3825-2:** Good. He needs to get his ass over here and figure out how to fix me. You guys have been pretty cool and all, but I’d like to be able to stand on the second floor without caving it in. Besides, I’m never gonna get a date with this weird flesh-snake dragging behind me.

> **Addendum 3825-A-01:** Researchers' Theories 
> 
> The debate over what made SCP-3825 the way it is has become a hot topic amongst every researcher and doctor with the clearance to know about it. A consensus seems to be forming, however, thanks to input from the Foundation’s extradimensional research consultants. 
> 
> The most popular theory as of now is that Dr. ████████’s statements as to the nature of spacetime were partially correct, but his attempt at manipulating the fourth axis of “time” went terribly wrong. Instead of sending the consciousness of 3825-2 thirty seconds backwards along the fourth axis, he instead widened the window that 3825-2 exists in conventional three-space.
> 
> If all things have an infinite number of forms that exist simultaneously along the fourth axis of time, what we see in our three dimensional world is derived from an infinitely small portion of the fourth axis, meaning we only exist instant-to-instant. 3825-2, unfortunately, was made to exist over thirty seconds, rather than a single instant. If a graph can be generated along the fourth axis, composed of all our forms across all of time, SCP-3825 is the result of taking a summation of points, taken every .1 seconds, over thirty seconds of that graph. 
> 
> I suppose we ought to feel lucky that the good Dr. ████████ did not have the means to create a more discrete summation, as a nearly-continuous integral of matter across any distance on the fourth axis would have an enormously high mass, potentially reaching the Schwarzschild density and collapsing in on itself as a black hole.
