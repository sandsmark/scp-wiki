title:Mainline Hub
Welcome to Mainline.

In the world of the SCP Foundation universe, anomalies come in all shapes and sizes. Some are statues, others are tomatoes. We've got toasters, lizards, a cactusman, a man-cactus, and everything in between.

And of course, there are bound to be drugs.

Mainline is a tale about one SCP in particular. "Spirit Dust" is the name whispered from coast to coast in Japan, a new drug craze that centers around the drug's ability to turn its user into an SCP for a while.

Of course, who else is supposed to stop this rather than the Foundation, and its special task force of undercover agents?
