**Item #:** SCP-4683

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4683-1 instances found within Nx-18 are to be contained and incinerated in the field with extreme prejudice, with a fifty-meter area around them being quarantined for at least ten days to observe further anomalous properties. Individuals who have consumed an SCP-4683-1 instance are to be detained for a period of up to ten days to contain any potential anomalies that rise.

For the duration of October 2019, all Anomalous Nexus Zones are to be monitored for the presence of SCP-4683-1 activity from within Site-87's Department of Nexus Research. Foundation resources and agents are to be dispatched as necessary to contain any and all anomalies that arise as a result of the presence of SCP-4683-1. 

**Description:**  SCP-4683 are apples originating in Chapman Orchards in Sloth's Pit, Wisconsin (designated Foundation Nexus Zone Nx-18). Largely identical to non-anomalous apples in terms of needs for growth and cultivation, SCP-4683 instances have a shelf-life of several years, are incapable of being bruised, and are highly resistant to diseases commonly affecting apple trees.

SCP-4683-1 refers to instances of SCP-4683 that are of a cultivar that genetically resembles Golden Delicious apples. However, SCP-4683-1 instances have a skin that resembles semi-liquid gold, which is reported to have a caramel flavoring. Furthermore, markings in Greek reading "ΤΗΙ ΚΑΛΛΙΣΤΗ", or "For the most beautiful", can be found on the skin of SCP-4683-1 instances. Unripe or under-ripe SCP-4683-1 instances will instead read "ΠΟΛΥ ΝΩΡΙΣ", or "Too Early".

The area around SCP-4683-1 instance is prone to large amounts of conflict, coincidence, and probabilistic anomalies. Within Nx-18, this results in high amounts of Narrative Turbulence, leading to unpredictable scenarios occurring.[[footnote]]For further information regarding the Law of Narrative Causality, consult [http://www.scp-wiki.net/i-h-p-proposal SCP-001 I.H.P.] [[/footnote]] Outside of Nx-18, the effect is less pronounced, --most likely due to the anomalous effects being neutered due to being outside of the native Nexus zone--, but can still cause large amounts of probabilistic anomalies to occur.

When consumed, the effects of an SCP-4683-1 instance are greatly increased, resulting in the organism that consumed it becoming an instance of SCP-4683-A. SCP-4683-A instances generate a Micro-Nexus[[footnote]]A space with a heightened Anomaly Occurrence Value whose total area is smaller than three-hundred square meters. To date, the only other example of a Micro-Nexus Phenomenon is Nx-92, "The Complex Apartment", located in New York City.[[/footnote]] around their being, resulting in localized anomalous phenomena. 

Within a Nexus Zone such as Nx-18, this effect is virulent and the area is amplified. A single SCP-4683-A instance can lead to an exponential increase of the local Anomaly Occurrence Value, resulting in an overall degradation of local reality.

//So people understand just how Serious this is: The AOV for Sloth's Pit is roughly 5.3 anomalous events per day. The [http://www.scp-wiki.net/apple-crisp-crisis Apple Crisp Crisis] shot it up to over 50. For an entire day, we were the most anomalous municipality on the planet. 'Terrifying' is an understatement.//-- Nina Weiss, Director, Site-87

**Incident Log:** 

**November 22nd, 2018:** First known manifestation of SCP-4683-1's anomalous properties. Several incidents occurred throughout Nx-18, in an event which has been dubbed "The Apple Crisp Crisis". At 4:30 that day, an individual known to be a member of [http://www.scp-wiki.net/starlow-grocery The Union][[footnote]]A Group of Interest that employs anomalously skilled workers.[[/footnote]] presented itself to Site-87 for containment. Designated SCP-4683-A, it claimed that it had "been commissioned to create something" that it now "sorely regretted". An interview with SCP-4683-A is documented below:

**Agent Allison Carol:** So. Do you have an actual name?

**SCP-4683-A:**  Haven't had one for a while. Just 'The Orchardist' will do.

**Carol:** Right, well. Orchardist. Things went pretty tits-up because of the apples. Seems that gastronomy accidentally used some in the dessert and now half the town's gone insane. We've got temporal anomalies on Main Street, the Catholic School is missing, we've got a 'recreational morgue' in the hospital, and poor Trevor Bailey can't stop ranting about how [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4223 Mountain Dew Apple] is... hold on.

//Carol pulls up notes on her tablet.//

**Carol:** "It's derived from the hate and bile of the darkest recesses of the internet." I'm fairly sure that he needs to stay in this universe for a good, long while.

**SCP-4683-A:** Someone... commissioned me to grow a special batch, from really old seeds. I don't know //how// they got them, they were supposed to have been destroyed. But... they said that you were doing too good of a job.

**Carol:** What do you mean?

**SCP-4683-A:** You managed to crack down big time after the Pit Sloth got taken care of. There was barely anything odd happening, and I think that... well, the powers-that-be got bored. 

//SCP-4683-A produces an apple from his sleeve and takes a bite. This sleeve did not contain an apple upon their containment.//

**SCP-4683-A:** Want one? It's pretty good.

**Carol:** I'll pass.

**SCP-4683-A:** Anyway, uh. I'm not even meant to //have// this job anymore, but the new guy's really reluctant to take over, despite all the signs he's getting. He'll be here in a few months, maybe he'll be more keen to take up the mantle.

//SCP-4683-A produces a glass filled with apple juice.//

**Carol:** Now I'm curious. Do you just tend to apple orchards, or...?

**SCP-4683-A:** I mean, the old cherry orchard got trampled by that giant radioactive George Washington a few 4th of July's ago. I managed to save a few trees, but yeah, mainly apples now.

//SCP-4683-A sips at their juice.//

**SCP-4683-A:** There's a job for everyone in the Union, you know. It's been a while since we've had a Narrator.

**Carol:** Again: I'll pass. Not against unions, but I'm not about to defect to an anomalous organization just because a guy who can make a glass of apple cider appear before him is asking me to.

//SCP-4683-A frowns at their glass of cider.//

**SCP-4683-A:** Was worth a shot, but the offer's open.

**Carol:** I'll keep that in mind.

//Carol starts to exit the interview room, before pausing to address SCP-4683-A.//

**Carol:** Is that cider or juice you're drinking?

**SCP-4683-A:** I thought it was juice. But I don't know anymore.

**December 3rd, 2018:** Several sliced SCP-4683-1 instances were served as part of the school lunch at Caroline St. Middle School. Mass consumption is believed to be partially responsible for the onset of a large snowstorm which stranded over three-hundred students and faculty within the school, necessitating rescue using Foundation resources. 

**January 21st, 2019:** Researcher Christopher Hastings accidentally consumed an SCP-4683-1 instance which appeared in their lunch in place of the non-anomalous apple they had packed that morning. In their shock, Hastings began choking on the bite of apple, which was subsequently dislodged by a Heimlich maneuver delivered by Agent Ruby Williams. This action is believed to directly correlate with Williams and Hastings signing a Relationship Declaration Form in April of 2019.

**February 14th, 2019:** Several marriages were carried out within Sloth's Pit as a result of an SCP-4683-1 instance being thrown down the main street, resulting in [DATA EXPUNGED]. The majority of marriages which occurred during this period were rendered null, either upon request of the betrothed parties, or due to outside factors, such as the other party's inability to consent to such an agreement.

//I married the woodpecker in jest.//-- Dr. Peter Abalone

**February 28th, 2019:** At a performance of a play at Novel Street Elementary School depicting the life of Isaac Newton, an SCP-4683-1 instance was used in place of the intended prop plush apple, resulting in an injury. While attempting to comfort Jackie Ruben, the student playing Newton, Mrs. Lindsay MacGillicudy tripped on the SCP-4683-1 instance, starting a chain reaction that resulted in all individuals within the building finding themselves on the floor, and unable to leave this position. A measurement of the area during this event showed a marked increase in gravitational force, which persisted for over three hours.

**March 12th, 2019:** Civs in Sloths Pit could just say words with one sound, no more. The same is true when we write re: the fruit. The fruit had turned to rot.

**March 26, 2019:** An SCP-4683-1 instance was thrown at Glenn Foster[[footnote]]The mayor of Nx-18[[/footnote]] by an unknown assailant, hitting them in the head. This event resulted in an attempt to ban the ownership and consumption of apples, which in turn led to the formation of a miniature black market surrounding apples, apple products, and food with an apple flavoring. This behavior was linked to a concussion as a result from being struck by the SCP-4683-1 instance.

**April 1st, 2019:** [DATA EXPUNGED]

//So. Many. Badgers.//-- Dr. Tristan Bailey

**April 22nd, 2019:** Drinks served at a midnight screening at the Select 8 Theater tasted strongly of apple. This corresponds with all individuals who left the screening becoming unable to recall the events of the film they had watched when discussing it with individuals who had not seen it for over three weeks.

**July 4th, 2019:** July 4th celebrations were able to proceed unhindered, with no evacuations necessary, and no deaths or collateral damage. This is highly atypical of Nx-18, where 4th of July celebrations have been banned for over fifteen years due to massive spikes in anomalous activity surrounding the holiday. Re-classification of SCP-4683-1 to Thaumiel was briefly considered.

**August 24th, 2019:** The produce section of Starlow Grocery briefly turned into a temperate rainforest. This event was preceded by Lucius Bell, sole employee at this store, finding a shipment of SCP-4683-1 in the storage area and purchasing one for his own consumption. No action was taken, as Starlow is believed to be under the protection of the Union.

**September 23rd, 2019:** At noon on the Fall Equinox, several Nexus locations around the globe begin reporting phenomena consistent with the presence of SCP-4683-1. The presence of SCP-4683-1 is confirmed within Harkness, Maryland and Yumegemu, Tokushima, Japan and Hy-Brasil. Following this, SCP-4683-A was confronted for interrogation.

**Agent Carol:** What the //fuck// did you do?

**SCP-4683-A:** So, you found the shipments.

**Carol:** Shipments? //Plural?!//

**SCP-4683-A:** The... original commissioner, he said he wanted more done. He wanted... well, his exact words were "I want them kept on their toes". So, we kept about... an eighth of the crop in the town, and sent out the rest on a time-delayed shipment--

**Carol:** To other Nexuses. How?! Sloth's Pit's brand of weird can't leave Sloth's Pit.

**SCP-4683-A:** The apples are grown in Sloth's Pit soil, but they aren't //from// Sloth's Pit. The seeds came from elsewhere, so their product can leave.

**Carol:** Who commissioned you to grow these things? How much is out there?

**SCP-4683-A:** I... didn't get his name. He wasn't from here, I know that much. But he knew about this place, and he knew about you specifically, Narrator.

**Carol:** Don't call me that. "Keep us on our toes", Christ. I need a physical goddamn //description//, Johnny Appleseed.

**SCP-4683-A:** He seemed... anti-gone-ish?[[size 0%]]http://www.scp-wiki.net/the-man-who-wasnt-there-hub[[/size]] That's the best description I can give.

**Carol:** That isn't a real word.

**SCP-4683-A:** Point is. There's more of them out there. About 200 tonnes worth, all over the world, and out of it, in some cases.

**Carol:** When are they going to arrive?

**SCP-4683-A:** I'd say... start of October is when they're going to begin cropping up big time. I suggest you dig in.

//SCP-4683-A produces an apple and offers it to Carol.//

**SCP-4683-A:** It's going to be a Hell of a Halloween.
