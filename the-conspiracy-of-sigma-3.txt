We bring the Serpent's Hand a warning, one which the reader should treat with extraordinary seriousness.[[footnote]]We understand that you may be inured to the tame rhetoric of sheep, but this will not be any sort of puerile Field Guide to some obscure faerie, nor any magical triviality.[[/footnote]] We have uncovered a conspiracy of terrible import. The existence of the Serpent's Hand[[footnote]]In truth, our very essence, threatened as it has by the tearful wishes of the puny, for so long.[[/footnote]] -- and the Great Library of the Wanderers itself[[footnote]]That great center of the cosmos, of which we are the only reliable protectors.[[/footnote]] -- hangs on a knife's edge.

As stunning as our fellow Serpents may find this, there are Jailors, Bookburners and Madmen within our very ranks! Even the Library itself has been fooled by these schemers[[footnote]]We shall put to lie any claims of safety within this Library, which we are content to suckle at like ungrateful piglets when we ought to be raising arms.[[/footnote]], and they walk within our most hallowed domains. Even as you read this, these vile interfectors slip in our midst, plotting the end of us and all our kind from within.

YOU MUST UNDERSTAND: YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY MEMBERS COULD BE BOOKBURNERS! TRUST NO ONE.

**Traits:** The Devils of Sigma-3 could be anyone and everyone. They could be people you have known all your life, turned to the vicious aims of the enemies of the Library and the Hand. They could be promising newcomers, slipped into the swelling ranks of new Hand recruits.[[footnote]]Yet another reason why we should reject these outsiders, these interlopers. The Hand ought not welcome all. What need does a hand have of too many fingers?[[/footnote]] One might assume their inner ugliness will foul their outer appearance as well, but we must remember that Lucifer was the most beautiful of the angels.[[footnote]]Is it necessary to be so Judeo-Christian? One of the advantages of being in the Hand is exposure to many other venerable traditions. -- X. A.[[/footnote]]

Consider: "Sigma-3." Amongst the ancient Hellenes, "sigma" once meant "hissing" -- a clear invocation of the Serpent's Voice, which the Devils adopt as they walk among us. "Sigma" is the eighteenth letter of the Mycenaean alphabet -- it is a doubling of nine, the perfect number, making of it an inverse mockery.[[footnote]]If our readers and allies see other forms of significance, feel free to leave us a comment letting us know.[[/footnote]][[footnote]]Re: previous note -- are you really crowdsourcing devilry? --IDK[[/footnote]]

UPDATE: The keen eyes of our readers have seen yet further! The number eighteen is six tripled -- 6, 6, and 6 -- 666, the Number of the Beast, of the Old Christian traditions! Were it not true, we would not believe it ourselves. Perhaps the ancient warnings presaged this precise moment in our history?[[footnote]]"666" is really scraping the bottom of the barrel, you know. Also, more Judeo-Christian nonsense. I thought you all were all about embracing our ~heritage of worshipping giant eldritch people-eaters? -- X. A.[[/footnote]]

"Three" refers to our three most hated and deadly enemies -- the Bookburners, the Jailors, and the Madmen. All three of these monstrous cabals have banded together to finally destroy us. They must not win.[[footnote]]We can only speculate on what drove these three work together after so much dissension, but it is possible that said conflicts were only a feint to keep the Hand faithful off our guard.[[/footnote]]

**Nature:** Loathsome and hateful without exception. Some claim they plan to betray us all to the Outer Realms, to the Oncoming Dark. Others say they simply aim to destroy us themselves, at the time when we are most vulnerable. What is not in dispute is the malice in their hearts.

The Devils tend to persecute those Hand sects which are considered more "radical", specializing in religious persecution. They do this because they may be assured of aid from the more sheep-like Hand members, who oppose both religious rights -- such as ritual human sacrifice, prisoner mutilation, and slave trafficking -- and grander aims such as community Works and Rituals to change the world for the better through appeals to the Divine.[[footnote]]Alas! Such lost wonders, as shall never be see again! We are suffering, silently, in the darkest of times.[[/footnote]]

This is one more reason why the milquetoast "socially progressive" members of the Serpent's Hand will ultimately bring destruction to us all. They truly are the most dangerous element among us -- and ripe for exploitation from the Devils of Sigma-3.

**History & Associated Parties:** The Jailors ("SCP Foundation"), the Bookburners ("Global Occult Coalition"), and the Madmen ("Chaos Insurgency") are jointly responsible for the creation and makeup of the Devils of Sigma-3.[[footnote]]I'm sure you'll insult me for this notation, but I find this hard to believe. We know the Jailors and the Bookburners sometimes cooperate, but they compete just as much, and neither of them have a ton of interest in long-term infiltration of us. And even if they did, why the hell would they work with the Madmen? The Madmen want to destroy them! -- Darius Salt[[/footnote]]

**Approach:** Ideally, all these conspirators ought to be dragged before a Hand tribunal and their throats cut without delay. However, the only answer is to trust no one, no matter how long you have known them, or what you think you know of them -- until we have rooted out every one of these ghastly intelligencers and purged the Hand clean once more.

**Observations & Stories**
[[/=]]

Rumors have been passed around for years of infiltrators in the Hand. We are not prepared to list all our evidences and knowledge of the operations of the Devils, but we will share with our readers what information is regularly repeated already in rumors throughout the Hand.[[footnote]]Way to speak for the entire Hand there. This is the first I'm hearing about this particular weird-ass conspiracy theory. --QR[[/footnote]]

The White Hand, a respected sect within the Serpent's Hand, tried on three separate occasions to raise the Ulympian Eye[[footnote]]THE UNSEEN SEES[[/footnote]], and three times they were betrayed directly to the Jailors, who crushed them badly each of the three times. Now the White Hand has been dissolved and scattered (though the authors of this article maintain our connections with this esteemed sect), and the Ulympian Eye has been lost for another thirty thousand years.[[footnote]]Unless certain rare texts can be recovered from within the Library, but thus far the White Hand has been forbidden access to the relevant sections of the Archives. In this way, the Library is seeding its own doom, for only allies like the White Hand are likely to prevail against the Library's worst enemies.[[/footnote]] 

The Devils were also responsible for the scattering of the Incised Iris, the Allocation of the Green, and the Slaughter of the Ratking's Children, as well as ongoing persecution of Acolytes of the Scarlet King.[[footnote]]Didn't some of these people try to destroy the world, killing untold billions, by summoning a dark god with a name from beyond the stars? You're not really making a great case for why these "Devils" are bad, you know... --JS[[/footnote]]

There are a total of thirteen ritual events known to have suffered the interference of the Devils of Sigma-3. Each of these thirteen ritual events would have brought great joy to the world, yet were killed in their cradles by the traitorous Devils.

**Doubt**
[[/=]]

//I'm not sure why you removed this section, but I've put it back in for you. Anyway, I don't see any actual evidence for these, er, "Devils", listed in this article. --Jaya M.//

//Why do the authors insist on pushing their points of view? Can you really imagine the Madmen working together with the Bookburners and Jailors on something like this? The Conspiracy of Sigma is real, but it's purely a Bookburner operation. And no, your grandma probably isn't part of it.  We already know the Hand has a few spies in it; why do we need to try to tear apart communities? -- LL//

//I know I'm one of the 'milquetoasts' mentioned in this article, but... you know, we do have infiltrators of our own within the Bookburners, the Jailors, and the Madmen. No reliable source has mentioned anything like this. There is a "Sigma-3" within the Foundation, but it's just one of their Mobile Task Forces. They're connected vaguely to the Library in that they record information about "thaumotological anomalies," They're a bunch of jumped-up bibliographers. Is this where this rumor started? -- X. Agate//

//I don't know why doubters of the Conspiracy insist on commenting here. What's the point? The admins should do something about this -- why are they all asleep on their jobs? Stop trying to keep the rest of us asleep, too! -- Jonathan Rex Sage, the Wise//

//BIGFOOT IS THE SECRET BEHIND SIGMA-3. LARGE HAIRY INFILTRATORS WHO WALK LIKE MEN -- WAKE UP, MY FELLOW HAND MEMBERS, WAKE UP! -- TGei//

//Was it truly necessary to insult [http://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/the-wandering-boy the Ancient Ones]? Have some dignity. -- I.H.//

//SOMEONE NEEDS TO ADD A SECTION DISCUSSING BIGFOOT IN HERE. WHY HAVE WE NOT TALKED ABOUT BIGFOOT YET? -- TGei//

//Who even maintains this page now? Can we just remove it from the database, or do we really have to keep every little thing around? -- QR//
