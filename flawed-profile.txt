{{**NAME:** Edward "Flawed" Flawrence}}

{{**SECURITY CLEARANCE LEVEL:** Level 2}}

{{**DIVISION:** Advanced Robotics}}

{{**HISTORY:** Researcher Edward was discovered along with his prototype time travel device at the 20██ Science Competition at the █████-████████ High School in █████, ███████.}}

{{Foundation Agents embedded in the program interviewed Edward and discovered the device to be the result of a bootstrap paradox. While he did not invent the device //per se//, the engineering skills required to build the device warranted Edward a position at the Foundation. Edward accepted the offer and officially entered Foundation employment on ██/██/20██.}}

{{Rumor has it that Edward used his device to desperately persuade Foundation agents into accepting him about 14,000,605 times, but it is unconfirmed.}}

{{**PROFILE:** Researcher Edward Flawrence may appear outwardly introverted, but beware because he might be the next guy to torture you with generally unfunny comments on every-single-thing-happening or worse, //unironically terrible// wordplay. Edward might look like an obedient and dutiful one, always accepting new tasks, but most of them end up on the desk that he's too lazy to clean off. He can also overanalyze things at times, making an argument with him extremely irritating.}}

{{According to his former colleagues, Researcher Edward does not have a [REDACTED FOR PERSONAL REASONS]}}

{{**ADDENDUM FWD-A:** While this is unconfirmed, it is noted that those within immediate vicinity of Edward has a higher chance of failure when doing basic tasks. Such failures include liquid spills, falling items and in some cases, disorientation. Whether or not Edward contains a probablilistic anomaly has yet to be concluded.}}

{{**ADDENDUM FWD-B:** Recently, Researcher Edward Flawrence has filed several complaints and expressed disagreement towards the Foundation's Secrecy Policy.}}

{{//I get it that the purpose is to keep the world sane, but can't we even tell close ones, ones that you really trust? All I wanted is to impress this girl, now I'm saving the world and she doesn't even know if I'm alive or not!// - Researcher Edward}}

{{On ██/██/20██, Researcher Edward's requests were (reluctantly) approved by the Ethics Committee.}}

{{The next day, Researcher Edward submitted the aforementioned individual, who appeared to be in massive paranoia, to Foundation custody for amnesticization.}}

{{//She didn't take it too well.// - Researcher Edward}}

{{//**AUTOMATIC SERVER MESSAGE RECEIVED:** The Foundation has no record of this ever happening, nor have Edward ever had a partner in the first place.//}}

+ Author Commentary

++ [[[SCP-3267|SCP-3267]]] - Memories Bound in Paper

> Hah, my first article. I admit that, while having read many articles before joining, I did not quite grasp what I was supposed to do for a scip. At least I remembered to use the Critiques forum beforehand though, lol. 
> 
> After failing to get "several" drafts through to no avail (all of which I cringe upon now), I came up with an idea: A library ghost that is way too strict about the rules. And making up a story for a haunting is easy. But then I struck multiple plotholes, and was it not for the incredible help of people on chat, I wouldn't have made it. After countless suggestions and two major rewrites on the storyline, I finally settled with Hippo's ideas, and went for more of a FNaF-esque soul-transfer-thing. Now looking back at it, the scip in its entirety seemed quite incohesive, but I was relatively satisfied back then. And still relatively happy about it now. I might do a minor rewrite in the future, but it is unlikely.

++ [[[SCP-3726|SCP-3726]]] - AnthropomorFic

> The inspiration behind this is somewhat simple and unrelated. I was thinking about the act of killing ants, how humans feel superior over small animals that can't fight back. Then I compared it to discrimination. I wrote the thing under an hour, and spent several hours getting feedback before posting it. Thinking back now, I should have gotten more, as the thing is quite a hit-or-miss. There are praises, and there are dislikes. I do plan to rewrite it in the future, but it'd take time before I snap out of my procrastination and actually do it.

++ [[[are we flawed yet|Artwork]]]

> How did you find this? No no no no, don't look at it, no, please, oh goddammit you looked didn't you.
> 
> Well, succumb to my cognitohazards.

++ [[[endless-light|Some Are Born To Endless Light]]]
> Yay, something after 3 - 4 months of endless procrastination. 
> 
> Took inspiration from MaliceAforethought's [[[Time After Time]]], really cool tale, check it out. 
> 
> But really, how well this article did amazes me when I go back to check it. At the time of me writing this commentary, it hasn't gotten any downvotes yet, and even have quite a few upvotes from people who I look up to[[footnote]] Including a rare psul upvote yay [[/footnote]], so needless to say I'm quite proud of this one. Also one year of not writing seems to narrow my vocabulary quite a bit, so I'm quite surprised at how fancy the wording is.

++ [[[scp-4267|SCP-4267]]]
> It was a year and a half between the writing of this scip and the last thing I wrote before it. I got into FRC, coolest program ever, but it also took a chunk out of my free time. When I returned, I did not have the motivation (or memory) to continue my ongoing scips, and decided to go with a new idea. 
> 
> I dug into my old idea dump and picked a randomly generated one involving a cannon and loneliness. Molded it into a claustrophobic article, with some details heavily inspired by The Enigma of Amigara Fault. However, my mind somehow got locked on a "short-scip mode" and could not for the love of God expand the article out, and what I wanted to convey was seriously limited. After several rounds of feedback (which were somewhat positive) I was still not confident that this would fly.
> 
> I talked with Hippo a bit, where his godly idea-filled mind imparted some wisdom on me. I switched to a chimney instead of a cannon, and even at one point came up with a fairy tale backstory (which I'm quite fond of, actually). I looked for fairy tales associated with chimneys and palmed my face so hard when I found Santa fuckin Claus. The rest is shenanigans. And now you have a very dumb article which somehow appears as a different holiday figure to each viewer.
> 
> The ideas I got throughout the conception of this one are still viable and I hope to incorporate them into other things in the future.
