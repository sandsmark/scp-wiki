++ [[[SCP-3267|SCP-3267]]] - Memories Bound in Paper

> Hah, my first article. I admit that, while having read many articles before joining, I did not quite grasp what I was supposed to do for a scip. At least I remembered to use the Critiques forum beforehand though, lol. After failing to get "several" drafts through to no avail (all of which I cringe upon now), I came up with an idea: A library ghost that is way too strict about the rules. And making up a story for a haunting is easy. But then I struck multiple plotholes, and was it not for the incredible help of people on chat, I wouldn't have made it. After countless suggestions and two major rewrites on the storyline, I finally settled with Hippo's ideas, and went for more of a FNaF-esque soul-transfer-thing. Now looking back at it, the scip in its entirety seemed quite incohesive, but I was relatively satisfied back then. And still relatively happy about it now. I might do a minor rewrite in the future, but it is unlikely.

++ [[[SCP-3726|SCP-3726]]] - AnthropomorFic

> The inspiration behind this is somewhat simple and unrelated. I was thinking about the act of killing ants, how humans feel superior over small animals that can't fight back. Then I compared it to discrimination. I wrote the thing under an hour, and spent several hours getting feedback before posting it. Thinking back now, I should have gotten more, as the thing is quite a hit-or-miss. There are praises, and there are dislikes. I do plan to rewrite it in the future, but it'd take time before I snap out of my procrastination and actually do it.

> How did you find this? No no no no, don't look at it, no, please, oh goddammit you looked didn't you.

> Well, succumb to my cognitohazards.

++ [[[endless-light|Some Are Born To Endless Light]]]
> Yay, something after 3 - 4 months of endless procrastination.

> Took inspiration from MaliceAforethought's [[[Time After Time]]], really cool tale, check it out.
