title:Visons of a Better World
It was such a simple idea, really. Barely a day dream, and yet... The proper forms were filed, the proper investigations taken, and, finally, everything approved. A single instance of SCP-500 was fed through SCP-786. And then, fed through a second time. Then, the pill now being too large to once more fit through the funnel, a chunk was removed, and the test was repeated, for quite some time, resulting in a near infinite supply of SCP-500. The pills were crushed, powdered very fine... and then introduced into the worlds water supply. Virtually over night, all diseases were cured. Behold, a better world.
