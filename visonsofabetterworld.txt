title:Visons of a Better World
It was such a simple idea, really. Barely a day dream, and yet... The proper forms were filed, the proper investigations taken, and, finally, everything approved. A single instance of SCP-500 was fed through SCP-786. And then, fed through a second time. Then, the pill now being too large to once more fit through the funnel, a chunk was removed, and the test was repeated, for quite some time, resulting in a near infinite supply of SCP-500. The pills were crushed, powdered very fine... and then introduced into the worlds water supply. Virtually over night, all diseases were cured. Behold, a better world.

That’ll never work.  You see, disease is only half the problem, and its half that should probably wait.  After all, natural selection has gotta do something, right?  What we //really// need to do is figure out how to make more SCP-458s.  Just imagine it.  One to a town, all across the world.  Forget disease! We need to cure //hunger//!  People living in deserts will stop killing each other over a single, drying oasis.  Families in Russia, or the homeless?  All well fed, happy, and suddenly prosperous.  Hell, the clone tree can grow pills that work 30% of the time, right?  Why not pizza boxes that do the same?  Just keep opening it!  Suddenly… poof! A better world.
