This log contains all currently declassified incident logs regarding [[[SCP-3780]]] and the Department of Temporal Anomalies' Operation Thunderbolt. Temporal Anomalies personnel are to use the following format when filing declassified logs:

> **Date:** 22/11/1963
> 
> **Attempt:**

> **Preventative Measures:**
----

> **Date:** 22/11/1963
> 
> **Attempt:** At some point between 6:00 AM and 12:00 PM, Oswald is surreptitiously swapped with an Anderson Robotics Saker unit. The deception is not discovered until 12:30 PM, when the Saker fails to shoot Kennedy and attempts to flee. Upon incapacitation, the unit is discovered. 
> 
> **Preventative Measures:** Temporal Anomalies personnel move Lee Harvey Oswald forward in time from 5:59 AM to 12:01 PM. The Saker unit pretending to be Oswald at 12:01 PM is incapacitated and transferred to Oswald's bedroom at 5:59 AM. Oswald is then subjected to a pre-prepared hypnotherapy regimen and prepped for assassination, which then proceeds as scheduled.

> **Date:** 22/11/1963
> 
> **Attempt:** An instance of [[[SCP-1746]]] forms over Dallas, forcing the presidential motorcade to be cancelled as a result of the storm. The resulting storm pattern devastates the city.
> 
> **Preventative Measures:** In the original variant of the timeline in which this incident took place, the waffle cone had not yet been invented, and the requisite frozen dairy confectionary to prevent SCP-1746 from forming did not exist. Thus, the Department of Temporal Anomalies sent agents to the 1904 Worlds Fair in Chicago to introduce and popularize the dessert, which would ensure the existence of the waffle cone in time for its use to prevent SCP-1746 prior to the presidential motorcade.

> **Date:** 22/11/1963
> 
> **Attempt:** At 11:47 AM, one hundred instances of the individual known as Allison Chao storm the Texas Book Depository, overrunning all posted guards as well as subsequent reinforcements. Temporal measurements of the depository suggest that each instance is a version of Allison Chao separated temporally by a single second relative to the original Chao's base time period. Each instance is uniquely prepared to handle part of the Department's countermeasures; together, they are able to continually overcome the Department's protective measures and kill Oswald.
> 
> **Preventative Measures:** The Department of Temporal Anomalies contacts each instance of Chao and provides her with different partial information regarding [REDACTED] in exchange for betraying her associates. As a result, the offensive fails at 11:48 AM as the Chaos turn on each other. At 12:03, the surviving Chaos temporally evacuate the area; Oswald is dosed with a mild amnestic to ensure that he forgets the events of the raid and successfully assassinates Kennedy on time.

> **Date:** 22/11/1963
> 
> **Attempt:** At 9:31 AM, an unknown assailant poses as a Secret Service agent and covertly bites President Kennedy. Simultaneously at 9:31 AM, the same assailant laces Oswald's bullets with lunar regolith. When the bullet impacts Kennedy's head, the President transforms into a werewolf, regenerates the bullet wound, and begins harassing pedestrians.
> 
> **Preventative Measures:** Prior to the planting of regolith, agents of the Department of Temporal Anomalies substitute Oswald's ammunition for bullets composed of a silver alloy. The assassination proceeds as expected, and evidence of Kennedy's lycanthropy is suppressed post-mortem. Due to differences in density, the silver bullet experienced a flight path and penetration profile slightly altered from what would be expected for a typical bullet fired from that angle. This detail is sufficiently minor that its likelihood of being noted by civilian observers is extremely low.

> **Date:** 22/11/1963
> 
> **Attempt:** At 12:25 PM, an entity identical to nightclub owner and Oswald assassin Jack Ruby somehow breaches Temporal Department defenses of the Texas Book Depository. Entity identified itself as "Lee Harold Oswalt" to guards, who allowed to pass uninhibited without concern for the situation. Entity discovered Oswald, and the two began to kiss and then have sex, distracting Oswald from his position killing Kennedy. Personnel either took no notice of this, or seemingly did not consider the situation unusual until a cephalopod tentacle emerged from the Ruby-entity's torso and stabs Oswalt in the heart. At that moment, personnel realized what was happening and decided to intervene,  the Ruby-entity reportedly exclaimed "That's all, folks!" and vanished. 
> 
> **Preventative Measures:** Oswalt's injuries were found to be minor, with no evidence of chest wounds or heart wounds found, despite contrary appearances. After brief medical treatment the assassination proceded as planned. At the tine of his death, Jack Ruby was found to have no anomalous qualities.

> **Date:** 22/11/1963
> 
> **Attempt:** At 5:30 AM, both Jacqueline Kennedy and Lady Bird Johnson appear to quickly gain large amounts of weight and then just as quickly lose them. At 6:08 that evening, Patricia Johnson McMillan[[footnote]] A journalist who interviewed both Kennedy and Oswald in her career, and later became a close family friend of Marina Oswald.[[/footnote]] is found wandering the side of a highway near Ciudad Techo, Bogota, Colombia, with a typed note in her coat pocket reading "Fat's where it's at! Look's (*sic*) like the first ladies lost the Battle of the Bulge." Oswalt was not affected.
> 
> **Preventative Measures:** Due to the anomaly's noninterference with the actual assasination, the Temporal Department only records the events as related to the central anomaly. It is theorized that this was an unusual and unsuccessful attempt to halt the assassination by an unknown party. All related persons issued Class-B amnestics. Following the assassination, Ciudad Techo, Bogota was renamed to Ciudad Kennedy. The significance of this is unknown.

> **Date:** 22/11/1963
> 
> **Attempt:** The assassination proceeds as usual until Oswald opens fire. He fires several rounds, missing each time (one shot wounds a bystander). President Kennedy's motorcade accelerates and escapes to safety. After the incident, Oswald is detained and found to be heavily inebriated. An unknown temporal agent had made contact with him earlier in the morning and purchased a large number of drinks for him. 
> 
> **Preventative Measures:** Tachyonic interference around the bar in which the unknown agent plied Oswald with the drinks makes prevention of his alcohol consumption untenable. Oswald is placed within a Class-II non-causal temporal loop until he is sober. He is then dosed with amnestics and returned to the Texas Book Depository in time to complete the assassination.

> **Date:** 22/11/1963
> 
> **Attempt:** A suitcase which contained a miniaturized thermonuclear device with a yield of 1.2 megatons of TNT (technology anachronistic for 1963) was discovered in the Texas Book Depository. It was accompanied by a note which read, 'Dear Foundation: Fuck it.' Device detonated shortly before assassination could be completed, killing Oswald, the President, all present personnel, and an unknown number of civilians. 
> 
> **Preventative Measures:** Experts in thermonuclear ordinance sent back to defuse weapon before detonation. Assassination proceeds as usual.

> **Date:** 22/11/1963
> 
> **Attempt:** A prepubescent spectator throws a rock onto Dealey Plaza when the motorcade passes. As Oswald begins firing, the President's limousine swerves slightly to avoid the rock. Kennedy is only hit once, a non-fatal shot to his left shoulder, before the motorade escapes to safety.
> 
> **Preventative Measures:** A Temporal Anomalies Agent grabbed the rock from the spectator's hand. Subsequent interrogation revealed no further motivation beyond juvenile mischief.
