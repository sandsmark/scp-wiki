**Item #:** SCP-159

**Object Class:** Safe 

**Special Containment Procedures:**
SCP-159 is to be permanently placed in the entrance window to Site ██. SCP-159 should only be activated when authorized Class D or above attempt to enter Site ██, and only activated by the current entrance guard, typically █████ ███████. The guard currently observing SCP-159 must make sure one of the neon tubes never flickers – if this is to occur, said guard must call an Level 2 agent or above to rectify the situation (see Document [2.71.32.█).

**Description:**
SCP-159 has the appearance of a standard OPEN neon sign. However, when deactivated by removing it from a standard power outlet, the building or room it is currently being displayed for becomes impossible by any means to enter (however, upon the observation of [DECEASED], it is still possible to exit). When active, however, the entrance to whatever building or room it is displaying for becomes suddenly unlocked.

**DOCUMENT: [2.19.21.██]**, Observations of The Effects of SCP-159

NOTE: All testing was performed on a standard tool shed with a window (for SCP-159 to be displayed from) and a wooden door.
-	When active, entrance becomes possible to lock, but unconventional methods can still open the door (lockpick, hatchet, etc.)
-	When inactive, however, the entire shed becomes impossible to breach by any method. Tests included thermal lances, high fragmentation explosives, tunneling, and hydrochloric acid. Requests for a miniature atomic explosion have been repeatedly denied; if a suitable location can be found for the test, O5 officers will review SCP-159’s atomic testing.

**DOCUMENT: [2.53.21.0]**, Dr. ███████ ████████’s Response to Personal Use

“Although some of us here are indeed, concerned for privacy, we should remind you that Site ██ is a high tech stronghold. Granted, some of you are bashful when it comes to showers, but that’s no need for you to try sealing the entire shower room for your personal use. Any other requests on this level shall be responded by a swift termination for the requester.” ~ Dr. ███████ ████████

**DOCUMENT: [2.71.32.█]**, If SCP-159 Tubes Should Fail

If a neon tube on SCP-159 should ever flicker, the current guard on duty must alert a Level 2 or above officer. After the alert, unplug SCP-159. This does open up Site ██ for potential security risks, but the threat of SCP-159 being destroyed is of far greater concern. When the officer arrives, they are instructed to replace the tubing with standard replacement neon tubing – it appears to be the device that the neon tubing is on produces the security effects, and not the tubing itself. But Dr. ███████ ████████ has a suspicion that if a tube should burn out, SCP-159 might be rendered unworkable and unfixable.
