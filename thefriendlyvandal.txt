[[tab A Note About My Future: 8/17/2019]]

As of today- August 17th, 2019- I'm going to try not to write for the wiki anymore, or to interact with the community anymore. I'm doing this in an attempt to get serious about my writing IRL and possibly get into a well-known writing Master's program in my state in a couple years, once I graduate from college. To do this, I need to build a portfolio, and I need to stop writing only for SCP. While I remain as invested in it as I have been, I feel like I can't fully commit myself to taking my original writing seriously. I need to make the jump and force myself to swim.

Roget once told a friend of mine that he wished this site could be a jumping off point for writers as opposed to a permanent fixture in their writing. This place has been a great help for me over the past 7 to 8 years and I'm grateful for the drive it gave me while I had it. It gave me something to reach for, and now I need to reach for other things. 

I will be deleting all my SCP drafts off my personal wikidot site and all my non-early-RP SCP posts off my tumblr (of which there are probably hundreds). I'm keeping all my AO3 stuff up as well as all my articles here on the wiki. I won't delete this account, but I'm going to sign out of it and try not to sign back in unless an emergency arises. 

To fully cut myself off, I need to post what I have finished of the project I've been working on for the past year. I'm going to reparent the chapter I have posted to this page instead of the Broken Masquerade hub, and I'm going to delete that page from the hub itself. In the next tab, I'm going to post what I had of that project, back to back. It was not finished, and you'll notice that many parts of it are missing, but I liked where I got with certain aspects of it, especially the chapter //Umbra//. I also really like my OCs, and might put them in some of my off-site stuff going forward. 

As nervous as I am, I'm also feeling excited for what the future could hold for me, and for the budding original projects I have going. I'm optimistic about my future. My goal is to eventually get something published, and then my loftier goal is to make it into that Master's program. If I end up like, getting anything published, I might post a notice here. 

Write boldly and bravely, everyone!!
-Van
