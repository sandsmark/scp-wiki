Should I deactivate my almonds, have my almonds deactivated, or otherwise get lost reeeeeaaallly lost in the sauce/become incapacitated, all my wiki stuff, including everything related to the wiki on [http://vanslibrary.wikidot.com/ my personal sandbox site], related old sandbox sites listed above, all my old stuff on my tumblr from my old 2013 Dr.Gears roleplaying days (//haunted voice// 2.9 inches.....), and all the wiki stuff on my [https://archiveofourown.org/users/thefriendlyvandal/pseuds/thefriendlyvandal ao3], are automatically in the jurisdiction of [https://v1als.tumblr.com/ v1als on tumblr] (through his associated wikidot account) and his husband. They can call the shots on everything, make edits, delete should worse come to worse, etc, although I would prefer a copy of my work to be saved. 

Everything else stored on my google drive(s), the writing program on my laptop (Zenwriter), the flashdrive on my keys/any and all flash drives one may find in my possession, unfinished shit that might be lying around my room in my hometown (mostly my earlier stuff), all my blogs/essays/nonfiction works, and in general all my writing not publicly accessible goes to my dad, and he can call the shots on all that and do with it what he wants. There //is// a good deal of unfinished stuff in that pool of shit. Like, literal years worth. Including some embarrassing things. And some things I wrote for myself with no intention of publishing. And some stuff that I would not like to have read so long as my almonds remain active and my sauce not lost. But like. You know. As for the unfinished wiki stuff that v1als and his partner may not have access to, the access of that remains at my dad's discretion, although they're the ones to go to should one wish to make that public. 

The SCP wiki was not a place I was expecting to put my writing will for my overall body of work, but I've been writing for a good decade now and I actually have, like...a //real ass body of work// just lying around. So I thought it should go somewhere. 

Note that I'm known for going long stretches of time without touching the Wiki, only to swoop back in and dump a HUUUUGE amount of shit like, a year later. So me being inactive doesn't necessarily mean I'm dead. Should I, you know, become deactivated, V1als should probably edit this page saying 'Hey lads, Vandal's almonds are deactivated. He's finally free of the ess see pee wiki and I will see him in hell' or something similar. Now, given I don't think he's aware that this message exists, because I don't think he or his primary accomplice really frequent my author page on the ess see pee wiki, but you know... I'm not even sure if I'm gonna keep this up, and that's a very strange discussion to have with friends, I think. Even people very close to you. Like what am I gonna do, roll into the group chat like 'hey lads, if I die, can y'all call the shots on all my public work on the site where I'm most well known as an author?' Like could you imagine? That's pretty wild. I'll edit this if it ever comes up in casual conversation, like if we're just hanging out and we're like, 'man, what if we died lol'. But should I have my almonds dried and deprived of their moist water content before that conversation happens, this is where I stand. 

As for my dad, he doesn't have a choice. He's gonna be faced with my 15,000 word nonsensical, plotless angst fanfiction of my own goddamn characters rotting on my hard drive, and he's gonna have to learn to come to terms with that somehow.
