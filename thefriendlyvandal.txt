[[tab A Note About the Wiki and my Future: 8/17/2019]]

To Whom It May Concern: 

As of today- August 17th, 2019- I'm going to try not to write for the wiki interact with the community anymore. I'm doing this in an attempt to get serious about my writing IRL. To do this, I need to build a portfolio and start fleshing out some of my original stories, and I need to stop writing only for SCP. While I remain as invested in it as I have been, I feel like I can't fully commit myself to taking my original writing seriously. I need to make the jump and force myself to swim.

Roget once told a friend of mine that he wished this site could be a jumping off point for writers as opposed to a permanent fixture in their writing. This place has been a great help for me over the past 7 to 8 years and was very formative in my early stuff, and I'm grateful for the drive it gave me while I had it. It gave me something to reach for, and now I need to reach for other things. 

I'll be deleting my non-early-RP SCP posts off my tumblr (of which there are probably hundreds), or at least all my SCP posts from the past year or two. My tumblr URL itself will be changed. I'm keeping all my AO3 stuff up as well as all my articles here on the wiki. I'll also be leaving all my SCP drafts up on my personal Wikidot site, but will be moving to a new Wikidot account under a new URL for my original drafts moving forward. This Wikidot account will not be deleted, but I'll be signing off and trying not to use it anymore unless some seriously wild shit goes down, or for some reason I decide to come back or make edits any time in the future.

--To fully cut myself off, I need to post what I have finished of the project I've been working on for the past year. I'm going to reparent the chapter I have posted to this page instead of the Broken Masquerade hub, and I'm going to delete that page from the hub itself. In the next tab, I'm going to post what I had of that project, back to back. It was not finished, and you'll notice that many parts of it are missing, but I liked where I got with certain aspects of it, especially the chapter //Umbra//. I also really like my OCs, and might put them in some of my off-site stuff going forward.-- 

EDIT AUGUST 30TH 2019: I've been thinking more about this story and I think I'm gonna rework it into something original, because the stuff that's good is like, //really good// by my standards and I really love the core of it. Because of this, I'm taking this copy of it off my author page. It's gonna need some serious work - that's 18k words of SCP content - but you know, you gotta do what you gotta do.

As nervous as I am, I'm also feeling excited for what the future could hold for me, and for the budding original projects I have going. I'm optimistic about my future. My main goal is to eventually get something published. If I end up accomplishing that, I might put a note here.

Write honestly and bravely, everyone!
-Van

++ [1] It aired on C-Span.

May 2025

Which political party stood for which side of the issue on the congress floor is ultimately irrelevant. It passed senate with a slim majority vote, then tumbled around capitol hill for a month before the hearing date was set. It was a nervous time. There were many unanswered questions of the very legal type that do not matter to those this bill affects, questions like is the Foundation a privatized organization? and how will this affect the no anomalous prison system? and do anomalous persons have rights? And because the people were scared and the men in suits are even more so, many of the specifics become glossed over in the way they are in politics. There was a word change here, a specifically worded statement there. There were many people who saw things they then pretend not to have seen. There were meetings with Foundation officials, and most importantly there was money passed around through the discreet budgetary veins of a large and incomprehensible machine, and then it was on the congress floor, and it aired on C-Span.

The bill was exactly 1,652 pages long. It was that long because it was the first of its kind. The money to pay came from the U.S. Military budget, and there was some huffing about this as well as long term fiscal outlooks and staff for the new Sites, but the fine print had been scavenged more than anything on capitol hill had been in decades into text that bound like barbed wire, stung like task force tasers, pounded like chamber doors slamming in bright fluorescent lights. The marble floor of congress gleamed mercilessly. A couple representatives stood at the podium and give strange, wandering speeches of the same breed given by the willfully ignorant. Yes, no. Maybe.

The Foundation sent one, too.

She stood outside the hearing room in her dark tailored suit, plugging one ear with a finger to better hear her cell phone. Unlike many of those expressing their opinions on the stand inside, Andrea Adams had spent many sleepless nights going over the 1,652 pages of this document, and was one of the fewer still who understood the full ramifications.

“They’ve made changes,” she said, distancing the phone a few inches from her left ear as the squabbling started. The person on the other end wasn’t technically supposed to have access to these documents, but even in retirement, he couldn't help but stay close and express his opinions. Four decades of working with Type Greens will make one attentive to anything major pertaining to that line of work passing in congress.

“What kind of fucking changes?!” Alto Clef guffawed down the line from somewhere north of Phoenix, Arizona. His leaked version of the document was from two months before, and was only around 1,000 pages. The extra 652 really make a difference, Andrea thought. God, what didn’t they change.

“Okay,” she said, slowly, “Don’t freak out, but they added 500 pages.”

There was an exasperated sigh from the other end.

“God, what a fucking shitshow!” Clef roared. “This is what I fucking said, didn’t I? If it ever went to congress…fucking…Jesus! God! For fuck’s sake!”

“It gets worse,” she said, “They want to contain them from birth.”

“They want screenings probably, too, right? Pre-natal detection and shit?” She could practically hear the years coming of his life. With any mercy from god he might have a heart attack before this passes, Adams thought. Put him out of his misery.

“They do,” Andrea confirmed. That was buried somewhere in the extra 652, where all the messy details were. The tech itself had existed for the better part of a decade. With the new Kant counters, an anomalous infant could be confirmed at as young as the second trimester. The wonders of science and all that.

“God…” He said, breathless. She half-expected to hear the wheeze of a respirator, some kind of indication that Alto Fucking Clef might be on his way out of this world at last, but all she heard was the sound of him collapsing melodramatically into an armchair.

“Enjoying retirement yet?” she teased.

Clef laughed bitterly. “Enjoying that I don’t have to be the one talking to senators.”

“I’m sure they’re enjoying not having to talk to you, either, if it’s any consolation," she smiled wearily. “They know you, by the way. Or they know of you, at least. Your signature is on a lot of papers.”

“Damn right it is!” With a chill, Adams realized she could hear the C-Span hearing coming through a TV on his end of the line. “They should know what I think by now, then.”

“Yeah,” she whispered. Alto’s opinion on Type Green control went undiscussed between them. He wasn’t a man that had ever been subtle about his thoughts in that regard.

“…Do you want to hear my prediction?”

Andrea heard the current speaker taking questions in the room behind her, and shuffled the papers in her hands nervously, pressing the phone between her ear and her shoulder. Opening remarks, the body of what she wanted to say; running through her notes about a new era, now. “I’m up next. I can’t talk for much longer-”

“If this passes, they’ll tear you all apart.”

He hung up.

Andrea would think over that line a lot in the coming decades. The sudden coldness in his voice implied what she already suspected: he knew she, his own former apprentice, had helped write this bill. He knew that she had especially had a hand in the final 600 pages, the damning final third. And more than anything, Alto Clef had suspected it damn near all along that she wouldn’t adhere to the mantra he’d lived by all 50 years of his career: kill them all.

So he wouldn’t have been surprised then, Adams thought, when he watched her take the stand in congress to give what had become the Foundation’s final word on the matter. Prenatal screenings at public health clinics, and entry of results into a database. A Foundation ‘Retainment Agent’ assigned to each child to preform social worker roles. Close monitoring. Rights to contain regularly through childhood if needed. Rights to separate them from others, rights to be careful, rights to be oh, oh so careful. More funding to build the humanoid sites and containment centers they needed to hold a generation of anomalous children, not just Type Greens anymore, hopefully growing up in a better, safer world.

Alto Clef did not call back afterwards. Adams suspected he had said all he felt he had to say.

++ [2] …and the nadir was cold and cruel.

March 2028

Placing Foundation sites was a nightmare before Korea, but this brave new world did not care where the designated 24 new humanoid sites were to be placed, and for that matter neither did most of the Americans watching this unfold. They rose across the country steady and fast. People- regular people, people who knew little and assumed plenty- watched them go up in the distant periphery of their daily lives with the detachment of someone believing it’s for the best. Life changed very little. Foundation patrol cars still sped along back freeways, kicking up dust in smoky trails. Notes on the third page of the local newspaper. Hey Susan, have you seen that thing they’re putting up where the Winston’s farm used to be?

In Oregon, it rose 45 minutes outside of Portland, in the Cascade mountain range. The equipment vans rumbled off the interstate onto gravel backroads that snaked through damp pines and Douglas firs, splashed in puddles and rocked side to side on the precarious terrain. The Foundation Jeeps wore their back tires uneven where the guns rested in the trunk with tire chains and emergency flares. This is where Site-54 rose: 1,200 feet above sea level, a fifteen minutes from the nearest town, and deep enough in the wilderness that very few outsiders had the opportunity to gawk at the newest local attraction as the rest of America had done with their own.

54 was a ribcage. The main wings thrust partially into the mountainside with steel rebar and drilling machines, and what wasn’t encased in stone sprawled outwards in a sprawl against the rock: several outbuildings, a large recreation yard lined with chain link, part of a medical wing, an armory, a dormitory building, a small office building, and a parking lot with a loading bay. The 500 horsepower Scranton reality anchor- a menacing black mechanical giant tucked in among the spacious subterranean containment wards- was the first piece of large equipment to be plugged in once the site was added to municipal power.

All of this was rather overwhelming to Walter Wilde, Foundation Retainment Agent.

He parked his car- a tan Saturn with the Foundation logo plastered along the sides- and leaned forward in his seat. The site had been open a couple months now, and he still couldn’t help but look up at the dark rock and faux wood siding when he pulled in. Huge. Absolutely fucking huge.

++ [3] Sisyphus

If there had been a time where the Foundation Pacific Regional Administration building didn’t stand on the corner of the intersection three blocks from the park he played in as a child, on the outskirts of the northern part of Portland overlooking the decay it had come to cause, Kilroy Fisher didn’t know it.

He’d seen it first when he was thirteen. He was sure he had had to have seen it before then, before the containment protocol went up and the city he’d lived in since he was four became something very different, but the first time he saw it and remembered it was when he was that age: the big brick building with adornments at the top like a great oak bookcase, the antique facade marred with barbed wire along the edges of the attached parking garage. It was the good part of the north side of Portland. The potholes were filled right away.

Sears took him there. If it had been anyone else but Sears, his mother’s ex boyfriend and someone with a certain amount of presence in the anomalous underground, as well as a generally imposing person— Sears was a tall fat man who, although generally amiable, was known for reacting to Foundation shakedowns with a certain amount of unbridled rage— he probably would have been more afraid than he was.

“I want to show you where I used to work,” he’d said, and they had been on the side of town by coincidence, although for the life of him Kilroy could not remember what it had been. The security cameras on the Portland Administration building had traced them as they passed. A time before the building was a time without the cameras, too, and he remembered seeing Sears walk so stiffly by, positioning himself closer to the great red box on the intersection, putting Kilroy on his right hand side closest to the opposite storefront, shops not for them and full of things they could not afford. They walked quickly. Kilroy had tried to get a better look one they’d been three quarters of the way down the street. Sears had responded with one big hand between his shoulder blades.

“Don’t let them get your face,” he’d said, and they’d kept walking.

The building that used to house the Amazon office sat two blocks away from Portland Administration. It always confused Kilroy how Sears had managed to go to work every day so close to it, passing it even, somewhere in a very different world where the tech incubators had been something other than abandoned, when there had been a lot more people and a lot fewer drugs. Sears told him before that he hadn’t always hated the Foundation like he did. He said he remembered even before the barbed wire went up that that wasn’t an unpopular opinion.

“You used to work here?” he’d asked, a bit taken aback. Unlike the ruins of the tech incubators on the northwest side, the old Amazon office had been repurposed instead of abandoned; it seemed to still be an office building, but Kilroy could see traces of the flashy stylistic choices typically chosen by large successful corporations with money to spend and stockholders to impress: geometric overhangs, wide windows, solar panels on the roof, faux wood paneling right inside the door. The building had an uncharacteristic smoothness, a modern styling made to look distinctive, carefully styled to fit something that had long abandoned it. It looked like a definition without a word.

He couldn’t imagine Sears of all people working in a place like this. Sears, who ran the Phreaker club out of an abandoned laptop assembly center on the outskirts of Portland, who he associated strongest with ebook publications and certain street drugs. Sears, who he’d never seen wear a shirt without a hole in it, who would not tolerate Foundation agents on his property despite them coming out at least two weekends every month. Sears, in a time far away when he was too young to remember, walking to work at the fancy modern Amazon office two blocks from Portland Administration; striding past and not being afraid of the cameras and going the same way home; getting paid, he imagined, on the regular, probably on not too bad of a salary.

Sears laughed and nodded. “I worked with the Kindle,” he said. “Man, at the time…we were about to launch a new one with a holographic screen. ‘Kindle Air’ is what they called it. It was gimicky as fuck looking back, but we were all obsessed with getting it right, you know? The first round of beta testing went well, but we were all terrified. Corporate wanted it done by the holidays. We had a month left and hit a bug with the battery. Like, it was functional, but it could be better and we wanted it to be better, so…”

He paused. Kilroy felt a tightening in his gut.

“…I mean, like, there were a lot of us working overnight, is what I’m trying to say,” Sears said tentatively, “I was running a test on the software. There were about five people around me, all like us. Must have been an hour to midnight. I wanted to go home and shower and change, so I was like, ‘you know, I’ll be back in a few hours. You guys keep going’. And you know Kilroy? They did. They sure fucking did keep going.”

He paused again. The building suddenly looked very empty, and very cold.

“And they died,” Kilroy said, almost as a question.

“They died,” Sears said, “and lemme tell you, kid, I’ve never seen investors pull out so fast.”

Somewhere far away, a dog was barking.

++ [4] In Which the City of Portland Puts a Legal Limit on the Number of Hair Straighteners One Person can Purchase at Once

As Mobile Task Force Commander Draven Kondraki squinted down at the charred hair straightener at the Portland police department, it occurred to him all at once that he had absolutely no idea what the kids were doing these days.

At least, it was clear that it had been a hair straightener at one time, before half of the clamp had been torn off and the resulting wires duck taped at the base. Even through his latex gloves he could tell it was sticky on the handle. The chord, which miraculously was still attached, ran across the examination table to what he vaguely guessed was a battery. The plug had been removed and the chord hotwired on manually. The whole contraption had been in a confiscated backpack. In all his years of action the amount of ingenuity drugs brought out of people continued to shock and amaze.

"And you…I mean, they…" he gestured vaguely at the head of the straightener, which was coated in a sheen of black tar.

"They burn it on themselves, yes," said his Lieutenant, "into the skin. It's a high-heat topical application."

That would have to hurt, Draven thought. "It's an analgesic, I hope?"

She shook her head. "It's a stimulant. More like cocaine than opiates."

"And kids still want to do this."

She looked at him strangely. "You're not very accustomed to the Type Orange crowd, are you?"

"I work more in the realm of Greens myself," he said, setting the contraption back down. "Oranges are technopaths, right?"

"That's right. There's a large population here," she said. "Portland used to be the Silicon Valley of the 20s' and 30s'.”

He raised an eyebrow. ‘Used to be?’

‘The city paired up with the Foundation to curb cybercrime a decade or so back,’ she said. ‘They weren’t too happy about it.’

‘You put containment procedures on the city of Portland?’

‘Not containment procedures,’ she said. ‘An ongoing initiative.’

‘Right.’ Draven ran two fingers under the chord, idly following it back to the hot wired battery. The tarry stickiness tapered off to a dusty, gritty feeling. ‘And the initiative was…’

‘Well, type oranges exert psychic control over electronics. So the thought was to inhibit that connection,’ she said. ‘Regional control decided to try an experimental technology. The effects were more neurologically severe than we anticipated when it went live. Foundation sentiment hasn’t been very positive around here since.’

‘Foundation sentiment hasn’t been very positive anywhere lately,’ Draven muttered.

‘Jesus, you can say that again.’

Draven’s fingers had reached the battery. It was a black, blocky contraption about the size of his hand, with a conspicuous silver switch at the top.

"Mekhane's got plans for you, dude," Crafter Of Mine said. "I had a dream last night, man."

"What did he say?"

"What did they say, man. Gender doesn't exist in the void, remember?"

"Right, right. What did they say?"

"Mostly a bunch of static, but like, it was directed at you. Like, they were pinging you, dude. Like, spiritually." He put a hand over his heart. "Pinging the username in your soul, man…"

"You are really, really high, Craft."

"I always smoke weed after I see the Mekhane, dude! It's intense as hell! I've been vaping since 4AM! I haven't even checked my messages yet!"

++ [6] a bending of reality

January 2034

She arrived at the hospital in six pieces. Her 6-year-old son arrived to Site-54 in one. Her husband stood sleepless in the kitchen of the big dark house and unplugged the crockpot she'd left running, then walked out the back door, down through the sandy soil of the backyard to the sharpened shale shoreline, and in the wake of seagulls wheeling overhead in the dimming light decided who to love.

It did not take long. The dark nearly escaped him.

+ 1. Penumbra

++ [7] MILES INTERROGATION 

There were dead moths trapped in the plastic casing of the rectangular overhead lights. 

Miles thought about the moths a lot. Foundation facilities were notorious for their barren nature, their desolate, oppressive sheen— but there were imperfections. Always imperfections. As a veteran of containment he’d made it a passive game to seek them out, and once he started seeking them he always could find them; moths in the light fixtures, scuffs in the paint. The office of his psychologist had a long black streak pressed into the baseboard near the sliding blast door. The Foundation emblem was painted into a pressed embossing on those blast doors, and on some of them— if you looked closely enough, if you had the time and the eye for it— you could see the paint chipping at the tips of the inward-facing arrows.

Chinks in the armor. Holes in the facade. Foundation facilities were designed the way they were for a reason, but the veneer was thinner in some places than in others. Palmer had told him there was a family of swallows that had started a nest in the broad overhanging steel of the entrance, right where the site meshed with the mountain slope. Miles was rooting for them. 

Not that he ever saw them. But it was a nice thought. 

He wasn’t exactly choosing to look at the moths in the light, but it was better than focusing on Director Eiler, standing a few feet in front of him with his cool dark gaze. Medical had already strapped him into the chair, so it really was a case of either looking at the dead moths in the overhead lights or looking at Eiler, unless he wanted to make eye contact with the medical officer to his left, uncoiling a length of long, thin plastic tubing. Miles knew that if he looked at it, he’d panic. He’d want to back out. And he’d made it this long, damn it. He didn’t want to back out.

“End of the line, Cuin,” Eiler said. “Last chance.” 

He would have panicked if he hadn’t been so weak. At least it made it easy. “I’m not eating.” 

Eiler had an immaculate way about him. He always had, all the years Miles had been in Site-56. He was a couple inches taller than Palmer, not really thin so much as he was lean, clean nails, slicked back dark hair, fucking impeccable the way he looked at you, the way he held himself, showed himself, talked to people. He liked this job, Miles knew, and he didn’t hide it. He didn’t hide that he was tired of the strike dragging on, either.

Kilroy was //extraordinarily// high on chink, which is why he didn't feel it when he fell over the top of the chain link fence surrounding the Foundation parking lot, hit the ground in a way that his left arm hit the edge of a dumpster.

++ [8] Foundation 04500 Containment-Issue Ereader VS 1000 Degree Knife

There are some who will debate the use of ereaders by anomalies in containment. Why not have a physical library, they say, like in most large prisons or hospitals, or provide tablets instead?

Most of these people have never set foot on a Foundation site and never will, and therefore do not understand 1. the degree of freedom granted to anomalies in containment, 2. the amount and selection of books regularly read by sapient entities in containment, and 3. the actual scale at which the Foundation operates all it's systems on a daily basis. 

These people also underestimate the amount of experience the Foundation has with handling the issues mentioned above. For instance, those arguing about the Foundation wasting their tax dollars have, in fact, been paying for the Foundation ereader system since 2010. Sometimes people want to argue for the sake of arguing to drag out discussion of larger problems as much as possible, and a portion of people who want to do away with ereaders in containment also want to do away with libraries in general for similar reasons, and at the end of the day the detail is so mundane it renders itself a footnote until rendered otherwise. For example: 

In the July of 2033, popular tech unboxing Youtuber Mootis21 decided to somehow acquire a Foundation in-house manufactured ereader. The documentation of the ordeal stretched to five episodes that garnered quite a bit of attention, first because of the amount of red tape around obtaining literally any piece of Foundation technology from the outside, then because of the amount of red tape around showing that technology onscreen to the public, then because of the red tape around acquiring one (1) Foundation ereader to unbox on youtube, and finally because the ereader itself was incredibly underwhelming despite the insistence that it was highly classified paramilitary technology. 

Mootis21 compared the device to popular brands and found it to underperform in most areas aside from durability, a characteristic that stunned audiences with it's demonstration in the fifth and final episode, 'Foundation 04500 Containment-Issue Ereader VS 1000 Degree Knife'. Due to the classified nature of the technology in question, the 45 minute long video was a breakthrough in the genre of  destroying expensive and obscure electronics for the sheer satisfaction of it all.

Of course, the mundanity of both the series and the technology in question meant that the ordeal did not bother the Foundation, and as the months wore on it affected absolutely nothing, except that the nature of the final episode of Mootis' investigation revealed it's full charred inner workings to the camera, and it was in the months afterwards that Nathan Sears- technopath, anti-Foundation anarchist and former Kindle engineer living in a decrepit abandoned laptop factory in Portland- decided that it might be possible to reverse engineer the innards of these ereaders from shots in 'Foundation 04500 Containment-Issue Ereader VS 1000 Degree Knife'. 

He was successful. The disappointing specs of the 04500 Containment-Issue Ereader allowed the hardware to be reconstructed fairly easily. 

Once he had engineered the bare hardware on his workbench three levels up from the former factory floor, Nathan Sears decided that it might be possible to develop a system to shuttle uncleared information and banned books to these machines for those who were seeking it.

And it was Nathan Sears that developed a form of malware to spread this system once he had built the programs and hardware to do so.

And it was Nathan Sears who began, systematically, to deploy anything and everything he could to these machines, using the mundanity of the Foundation ereader system to provide cover from Foundation security. And Nathan Sears quite honestly did not think it would be able to last this long, and thought that maybe he was underestimating the Foundation's attention to the ereaders they gave to people in containment, and for a few years hovered on the edge, starting slowly with access to newspapers, to transcripts of radio shows and movies, staying up at night wondering if he would be taken away. 

But he wasn't. And the years wore on. And it occurred to Nathan Sears that really, truely, the Foundation did not care, and that he was but an insect invading an afterthought of a wireless system, someone regularly rooting through a dumpster at the edge of Area 51. He was so entirely insignificant that the regular security sweeps, when they happened, didn't pick up on him, or just didn't consider him a big enough problem to do anything about it. Maybe, he thought, there was someone like him working wherever the Foundation had their ereaders manufactured, someone who knew but also valued what he was doing, or alternatively some sort of divine intervention sheltering him from the effects of all the few and minor system and inventory updates that came along. 

Once he had reached this realization, Nathan Sears entertained the idea of maybe doing more, something involving the ereader touchscreen capabilities usually used for searching for titles in the database and going to locations in books. And he would need help to do more. It was around this time, then, that Nathan Sears recognized Kilroy Fisher living on the streets of Portland. By the time Fisher was physically well enough to work again, Sears had the chatroom service ready to be deployed through the malware that had at this point been inserted into the Foundation ereader service for a decade, and the two went to work implementing it on a small scale, to the Site-54 system of some 100 devices. 

Of course, it would be hard to find it. It had to be hard. Providing a rudimentary chatroom service was much different from providing some sort of popular-on-the-outside erotica. They decided, after some deliberation, that the chatroom would have to be unlisted in the database. They would make it accessible through an ebook hyperlink, somewhere hidden enough to evade Foundation IT but open enough that a person with nothing else to do aside from read could theoretically find it. //What// book, or where, was left up to Kilroy, who could not resist the temptation to associate it with some sort of literary irony. 

He put it in William Gibson's //Neuromancer//, the 1984 science fiction novel that popularized the word 'cyberspace'. The quote on page 106 now read: 

> There were cigarettes in the gift shop, but he didn't relish talking with Armitage or Riviera. He left the lobby and located a vending console in a narrow alcove, at the end of a rank of pay phones. 
> 
> He fumbled through a pocketful of lirasi, slotting the small dull alloy coins one after another, vaguely amused by the anachronism of the process. The phone nearest to him rang. 
> 
> Automatically, he picked it up.
> 
> "Yeah?"
> 
> Faint harmonics, tiny inaudible voices rattling across some orbital link, and then a sound like wind. 
> 
> "Hello, Case."
> 
> A fifty-lirasi coin fell from his hand, bounced, and rolled out of sight across Hilton carpeting.
> 
> "Wintermute, Case. It's time we talk. If you are reading this, you are in containment in Site-54, and we have leaked this book into the SCP Foundation ereader system from the outside. This link will allow you to communicate with an illegal librarian of sorts. Revealing the location of this link to Foundation staff will nullify chatroom access." 
> 
> It was a chip voice.
> 
> "Don't you want to talk, Case?" 
> 
> He hung up.
> 
> On his way back to the lobby, his cigarettes forgotten, he had to walk the length of the ranked phones. Each rang in turn, but only once, as he passed.
   

Admittedly Kilroy was not optimistic as to how someone would find this. What were the odds that even one person in the system of 100 devices on a single Foundation site would request a copy of //Neuromancer// from the central system? How many of them, then, would read to page 106? And what were the chances of that person being willing to talk to someone from the outside? 

Kilroy thought this because he greatly underestimated 1. the degree of freedom granted to Miles Cuin specifically, who lived in class 1 lockdown containment and had absolutely nothing else to do, 2. the amount and selection of books regularly read and reread by Miles, who was disproportionately attracted to byronic male antiheroes (which was absolutely NOT gay, thank-you-very-much) and 3. the actual scale at which Miles loathed both himself and the Foundation nearly equally.

So Kilroy was on Chink, as he generally was. He had the chatroom up in a separate window, as he generally did as requested by Sears. He was working, late at night, a month after the malware was deployed, and was so high and deep in concentration he thought he nearly thought he imagined the message:

> **78839**
> Wintermute?

++ [x] Pythagoras

The lockdown exercise yard was incomprehensible. Miles thought of it more like a shaft of some sort, the sheer height of it, how it slit through the mountain with it's blank concrete walls. It was bigger than his chamber- he could walk bigger laps in it, which he didn't mind in the case of making the best of things- but also infinitely more void, like he sat at the bottom of an insurmountable pit.

The perpetual cold that penetrated the deep dark of Site-54 also penetrated the smooth steep concrete of the yard, but it was different in that daylight filtered in some two stories above, first through a flat plexiglass roof protruding at some point from the mountain, and then through a sheet of barbed mesh several feet below, the latter of which seemed redundant to Miles in the grand scheme of things. Despite the pit being the only place where he had exposure to natural daylight, once a week at 1:15 pm on Wednesdays, it also seemed like the least likely place for a breach to happen. It wasn't like anyone could climb that high, and if they could they'd hit the mesh, and by the time they hit the mesh the guards could see them on the rectangular security cameras in the four walls directly below the mesh, their protrusions the only real handholds he could find; and that was a long way straight upwards, and a long way straight down.

He thought that often. That was a long way down. He was a long way down, and that was after a short walk to the yard up a few flights of stairs with a guard on either side of him, then down a long hallway lit with fluorescent lights to the solitary steel barn door on sliding rails. So his chamber, and in conjunction the life he led, must be a long, long way down. And the pit was a visual representation of that.

Miles tried to calculate it once. He wasn't very good at math, but he was being taught trigonometry in the readings they gave him and decided to try to calculate it, if for no other reason aside from his own amusement.

At 1:15pm, the sun beat straight down through the skylight onto the security cameras, and the one mounted directly above the barn door sent a shadow across the floor. Miles measured this shadow, toe to toe, estimating two feet; and the angle was steep given the direct sunlight into the pit, so he'd say 85 degrees from the shadow on the floor up the hypotenuse to the camera; and the angle between the floor and the wall was 90 degrees. The sum of a triangle's angles add up to 180 degrees, so, he figured, that would make the degree of the angle between the camera and the wall 5 degrees, which seemed extraordinarily steep, but the shadow on the ground was extraordinarily short compared to the size of the chamber itself, and Miles didn't have a protractor to really get a measurement on. After dealing with the sines and the 2 foot side, that would make about 22 feet straight up, except for the mesh right above the cameras was another good distance from the skylights.

So, Miles decided, 25 feet. It gave him a strange sense of accomplishment, that estimate. In the Class 1 yard, I am 25 feet from the surface. It didn't seem that bad. 25 didn't seem like an incredibly large number, and the pit always made him feel so small at the bottom. Optical illusion, then, he thought, or maybe 25 feet always seemed that big no matter where you were or what you were looking at, or maybe it just seemed that big when the only real light you ever got to see was about that far above you, about that far out of your reach, a distance that would kill you if you fell.

Miles then tried to extrapolate: how far down was his chamber from the surface? Miles didn't know how to do the math for that. It was some 20 steps from the barn door down the hallway to the stairwell. Four landings straight down in terms of stairs, barren stairs that only led between the yard hallway and the ward. Then another walk, longer, straight and flat, back down to the sliding door at the beginning of the ward, right next to big barn door that divided the orange class from the red- so many doors- and then another short walk to his chamber.

Miles decided that was too many goddamn triangles. And the mountain would slope up as he went down. So how many feet, straight up? He could at least say it was more than 25. Probably many more than 25. Some number that actually was big. But unlike in the concrete yard, Miles wasn't sure that it was his chamber's depth alone that made him feel so small all the time. Sometimes Miles looked up at the 25 foot pit and thought about what it would be like if this deep, heavy world he'd lived in for years would suddenly come crashing down.

In a way he wished it would just happen already. He imagined the mountain bringing hundreds of feet of rock down on top of his steel chamber. He imagined it coming down on him in the shower, or in the hall. He imagined the rock crumbling away, sending the stairs leading up to the 25 foot pit careening down however many feet four landings consisted of, and of course some Wednesdays at 1:15 he imagined what it would take for him to climb, to put his hands and feet in the corners with a running start, and if he got high enough he could ignore the mountain entirely and drop down the entire length of the shadow in that burning noon light, bisecting the hypotenuse, the sines and cosines, the 22 foot right altitude and everything Pythagoras fought for, and he would hit the adjacent side and crack his head open on the floor of the yard and the last thing he would see would be the cameras.

++ [x] god i dont even fucking know its just about portland

The biggest facade the Foundation kept, in Kilroy's opinion, was their records. The Foundation was notoriously meticulous with their records, always was and always will be, but they were also very meticulous about what they kept //off// the record; files that existed but had been misplaced, people who had disappeared in the night, reporters who were paid off, projects that had been officially shut down but who's influences remained, sustained by single drips from an unknown source. The Foundation operated in an infuriating grey area where movements pinched the legal guidelines with lawyer-tight accuracy; just far enough to do harm, but not far enough to be persecuted. When lines were crossed, money went quite a ways in the art of not being persecuted. And of course, maintaining a good public appearance also went quite a ways, even if the public image rested on this facade of transparency. 

The technopaths and Maxwellists of Portland had decided some time ago that if they wanted to fight in the grey area, then the grey area would just have to be made to work. And you could make good money selling information to GOIs. It was a hobby, really, most of the time. 

The Maxwellists were not strong believers in the art of being petty, but the technopaths were. For instance, the technopaths did not //technically// dig the tunnels themselves, but used drones to do it for them, which Kilroy thought was stretching their luck a bit far, 

------

Although Miles lived in a room by himself that he could not leave, in a place where he had not seen sunlight in two years, he did not consider himself, consciously, to be lonely. This was largely because Miles had a very active inner dialogue with himself. He read, he wrote, he thought. He had a regular rotation of people he would see; it wasn't like he was without any human interaction entirely. Wilde, Palmer, whoever brought him food, his psychologist. Eiler, sometimes. 

These five people, along with himself-- the constant commentary on his actions, on what he was reading, fantasy worlds he constructed to immerse himself in, the dim reality of what he saw in the mirror, of who he was and who he perceived himself to be--  was enough to superficially sustain him. He liked to imagine that it sustained him in a deeper than superficial way, because this all created the illusion that he was busy; yes, he could go for several days without talking, or by only talking to himself, pacing around the very edges of his chamber, doing homework, thinking and constructing and writing and reconstructing, but in that state he considered himself to be entertained, and therefore Miles did not think he could be lonely. 

Miles would learn later in life that saving oneself from boredom was different from saving oneself from loneliness. He would see that he was both terribly lonely and horribly depressed, because without another person-- not Foundation staff, but a real //person//, someone who might find his perceived glaring flaws and neuroticisms tolerable-- Miles was left to his thoughts, which both sustained him and festered in the way that a mild acid corrodes to bone if left undisturbed.

Yes, he spoke to people every day, or mostly every day. Yes, if he didn't have anything to do while sitting alone in the place where he lived, he could make something up to entertain himself. Yes, if he found himself impossibly bored with real life, he could simply embark on something of his own making, an extended fantasy expedition that could last for weeks or months on end, running in the background, feeding the parts of him that could not bear to be. He could not be depressed because he was not bored, and he could not be totally isolated because he spoke to a handful of people every day, and yet even when the connection with Kilroy would come- something that would prove very dear to both of them- the corrosion would still come, hot and sinking in a way he was not aware of until his fantasies and books and writing suddenly ceased to distract him, and then the realization of isolation would set in, the desperate need to be touched or spoken to face to face, the painful ache of a social creature, and what could he do then? Where could he go? How could he escape himself when what he believed was himself proved transient? 

And that was always the worst, the sudden pressing weight of isolation, of loneliness he repeated to himself he did not have. He didn't think he wanted sexual intimacy; he didn't picture himself in a romantic way with someone, didn't see himself fantasizing about people he could never meet and interactions he could never have. But he //did//, at night, pretend he was being held. As with many things, he would imagine this thing he could not have, and if Miles was good at anything he was good at imagining:

The person was always nameless, faceless, genderless; he did not picture their clothes, or their hair, or their appearance in general, because he did not have anything to base it off of, or any preferences of the kind of person he might like or love, or enjoy being held by to begin with. Miles //would// imagine that they loved him, except in an unconscious kind of self loathing this somehow made him profoundly uncomfortable, and so he would simply pretend he was someone else, in a different place, being held. Both of them nameless, faceless, genderless. Both of them, fit into a plastic cutout of memory from his childhood he labeled under 'outside': highways, people going to work, trees changing colors with the seasons, dogs on leashes, malls with neon lights, his parents' house by the ocean, the elementary school he once attended. These two people, he thought, had a nondescript place in this nondescript world, but they had a place. And they were calm, and happy, and they were touching each other in a way that was heavy and warm, and in this way Miles would lose himself to sleep, and he was not lonely at all.

++ [x] Two Bros on Foundation Property 25 Feet Apart 'Cause They're Not Gay

Mine of Craft drove the van north past Regional Authority in it's great bookcase brick, passing people congregated in alleyways selling flash drives with strange documents, mangled mechanics, chink in pill bottles and ziplock baggies, becoming increasingly barren before giving way to roads with sunflowers sprouting from the sidewalks, decrepit neighborhoods, vacant lots between warehouses and crumbling concrete structures, all of which Kilroy recognized, then vaguely recognized, then eventually didn't recognize at all. 

The brakes on the van were fucked in such a way that stopping at a light for longer than a few seconds caused the pressure to wane and fail from the brake hose, and started the car rolling forward ever so slightly into the intersection. When this happened, Craft calmly stomped repeatedly on the pedal in a way that led Kilroy to believe that theoretically, in this city where people dealing with mechanics were a dime a dozen, he was just too goddamn lazy to get them fixed, or just wasn't willing to spend the money so long as the car could still be stopped. Thinking about where they were going and what they were heading out to do, Kilroy was beginning to think that maybe Craft put a little too much faith in god sometimes. 

//Too late for that//, he thought, looking at the long silver antenna protruding from the edge of his backpack, and the receivers and wiring connecting it to his laptop. If he could get Sears' program to work on his phone this would be a hell of a lot easier, but then again he was beginning to wonder if the Foundation would pick up the signal, which then turned into the subtle realization that this was very real, trespassing on Foundation property like this. It was one thing to trespass in the city, it was another thing altogether to trespass up the mountain; Craft said the Maxwellists held vigils there occasionally, and that they'd never been caught with all their equipment, and that the mountain was probably too big for site security to patrol all at once. 

Kilroy didn't really want to ask who the vigils were for. It made him worry about Miles. 

The cracked city streets turned into suburb that smeared out and thinned. Box houses with golden retrievers in the backyards, then farmland across the street, then only farmland. Then forest. And then they were going upwards, slightly, towards what was marked as a Nature Reserve: Next Right, and then they turned left (sound of Craft stopping for a deer and pumping the brake pedal against the floor as it ran away), and then they were going up a neatly maintained road flanked by douglas firs and pine needles, and the radio station they were tuned to started to crackle out until it, too, was smeared into a disconcerting nothing. Kilroy turned it off without touching the console. 

"...And you know where this thing is?" He asked. It seemed strange to him that something like a recreation yard would just be out in the open, unless the Foundation was very, very confident in the structure's ability to prevent a breach. Kilroy had never been formally contained, but he knew enough to know that the Foundation didn't fuck around with their containment structures. 

Craft didn't take his eyes off the road. "You really can't miss it, dude. Like... wait, hold on." 

Without any more warning, Craft swung the car to the right, plunging into the woods. Kilroy scrambled to grab the antenne before it smacked into the dashboard, then held the backpack against the passengers' seat and gripped the arm rest. For a second he thought they were crashing, except that Craft looked incredibly calm; and then the woods opened onto a weedy gravel maintenance road. 

The van hit the path and leveled out. Craft hit the brakes, then looked back down the path to the right, where Kilroy guessed the road opened onto the main Foundation grounds; then let the car roll left when the brake fluid failed to hold. And then they were driving, kicking up gravel, and Kilroy exhaled a breath he didn't know he had been holding. 

"Dude, holy //shit//," he said. 

"Sorry, cowboy. I forgot where the entryway was," Craft said. "But anyway. You'll see when we get there. It's not really an exercise yard in the normal sense of the word."

"How'd you guys find it?" 

"You know Dot Zip? A few years ago he came out here when he was high and tripped over it."

"He...//tripped over it?//" 

"Oh, yeah. Twisted his ankle and was stuck there until we could come get him." 

Dot Zip delt in shit-grade Chink and squatted in a warehouse reeking of the industrial paint strippers he thought were a well kept secret ingredient. It would have surprised Kilroy to see him //not// high, seeing as he slept twenty feet from his workbench, and the idea of him tripping over some sort of obscenely obvious fence or building wasn't incredibly far fetched. He wasn't exactly the sharpest tool in the shed, and she was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb in the shape of an "L" on her forehead...

Having finished the thought to its logical conclusion- All Star playing over a visual of Dot Zip crying softly in the grass on Foundation property, slurring a prayer to Mekhane, a white patrol car in the far distance looking much more menacing after huffing paint remover- Kilroy turned back to the situation at hand. 

The road, after a while, began to turn slightly; Kilroy began to see the curvature of the Mountain and the fact that they were beginning to gain some amount of altitude. He nervously opened his backpack and poked around until he found the status check light Sears had insisted be installed. A dot the size of the head of a pin glowed green from the monstrosity of hardware plugged into his laptop. Still connected to the ereader system, if nothing else. Still could message Sears if this all went to shit. 

He was starting to feel tired under the hot, sick feeling of Chink crash creeping under his skin. He thought about when he last slept; decided it was a good few days ago, probably more. But that was just how Kilroy worked. When they got back he would take the rest of the lull in work to sleep, probably for a good while. But he wanted to see Miles first, and the adrenaline of that was starting to leech the drug out of his body faster than normal, and there was more than exhaustion under the drug, whenever he crashed hard like this; there was an anxiety, an urge towards avoidance, a potent sense of self-loathing and an overwhelming ominous dread, sometimes all at once. 

Kilroy wanted to sleep when he crashed for more than just the reason of being tired. He wanted to sleep because when he was sober, he was scared, and worse than being scared: he was unfocused. Like he was becoming now. He should have just taken another hit, he thought. He should have seen this coming, and how the hell was he going to deal with anything with Miles, with whatever there was with Miles that made him so worried even when he was high--

And then the forest opened into a meadow, yellow and gold and dappled with early spring wildflowers. The sky was wide and blue and faded into the grey Portland skyline to their left, where the meadow continued downwards; and upwards, to their right, to the peak of the mountain, where it clung to the rock for a distance beyond a steel grey fence about ten feet from the road and eventually dissolved into craggy rock beyond what was visible from the van.

Kilroy was beginning to see why the Maxwellists risked Foundation security to pray here.

"We gotta go in through the broken part," Craft said in his thin metallic voice, indicating the fence to their right, "There's a place up here that they never fix. Probably think it's no big deal."

"Where the hell do you park the car?" Kilroy was starting to feel the antsy effects of crash, starting with the realization that if they got caught they could be killed, and whether or not they would be able to adequately hide the van, and when the patrol cars would come by, and if there were cameras they just couldn't see, and what would happen to Miles if they found the ereader hack--

"Relax," Craft said, sensing his mounting anxiety, "See that rock up there?" 

Kilroy looked. Straight ahead, just to the left of the gravel road extending out of sight in front of them, was a boulder surrounded by a tight grove of trees. As they approached, Craft swerved off into the meadow flanking it, flattening weeds and grass behind them (//oh my god, what if they see the tire marks?//) then moved smoothly around the back of the grove to what seemed to be a less-than-frequently used alcove lined with gravel.

"The Foundation patrol people park here sometimes. Not always, but in a pinch they do, apparently." The back of the van was facing the fence. Craft hit the brakes, then put the car into park, then pulled back the parking brake, then flipped it forward, then pulled it back again until it made a disconcerting shrieking sound, then grimaced, pushed it forward again, pulled back again until it shrieked //and// clicked, then seemed satisfied enough and pushed open the driver's side door. The trees would theoretically catch the van if the brakes went out, but between Kilroy's underlying anxiety and the downhill direction the car was facing, the fact that Craft wouldn't just get the fucking thing fixed irritated him to no end. 

But the meadow really //was// beautiful. If they hadn't been so close to Foundation property, this might have calmed him down more than it actually did. Kilroy heaved his backpack up, shut the door behind him, and tried to find any sign of actual Foundation presence beyond the fence. Nothing. 

"It's up there," Craft said. Kilroy squinted. Still nothing. Checked his phone. The time was 1:00. 

"Can we get there in 15 minutes?" He asked.

"Oh, absolutely, man. It's seriously straight ahead," Craft answered, walking confidently up the slope to the fence, which was much larger as they got closer, and lined with barbed curls on the top. Ahead of them was a sign that read: SCP FOUNDATION PROPERTY. ELECTRIC FENCE. DO NOT CROSS. 

Craft led them up at an angle, and then they were walking along the fence at a distance where Kilroy could sense the sharp tang of electricity at the back of his mind. They walked until there was another grove of trees, and behind them an area of the fence that the Maxwellists had cut away and lined the edges with heavy-duty rubber. How they managed that, he had no idea. 

The opening had plenty of space to spare crawling through- they had probably brought equipment up here at some point- but the sheer voltage still made his ears ring, overwhelmed his senses in a way that made him wish he was high even more than he had before, wished he was in a state where he could take in that amount of technopathic input. He'd taken similar voltages on Sears' payroll and still managed to think over the hot psychic roar of electrified metal, but now it just felt raw and painful and overwhelming, spiking into the back of his head and rattling down his spine. 

"You okay?" Craft asked. Kilroy realized he was standing on the other side of the fence, wincing. 

"Yeah, I'm good. Just, k'now..." 

"A lot?" 

Kilroy sighed. "Yeah. A lot." 

Craft nodded sympathetically. "My eye always goes fuzzy through there. Don't know what they're trying to stop with that kind of voltage..." 

"People like us," Kilroy said, and found himself smiling despite it all.

"Still a hell of a lot for people like us. Jesus!" Craft called behind him. "I always thought if like, somebody died on that thing, you could just throw them back on and they'd come to life again, y'know?" 

Kilroy laughed, more out of obligation than anything else, and then found himself wading through knee-high grass and flowers, listening past the ringing in his ears to the hum of insects around them, the warm heat of the sun. They walked like that for a while, just placidly up the mountain, until the fence was still in view but farther off; and then the meadow seemed to flatten out for a bit, eventually meeting up with a craggy gray slope significantly steeper from what they had been walking up on, and it was there that Kilroy started scanning for more electrified fencing of some sort, expecting it to be bolted into the rock, caged in like Alcatraz on an isolated outcropping. 

And then Craft shouted something from ahead of him, standing thigh-high in the golden meadow. Kilroy started to quickly close the distance, still fixated on the endless rocky slope beyond, and very much almost tripped on it. 

He stumbled back slightly, and, perplexed, examined what he was looking at.

It was incredible how well hidden it was with just the meadow surrounding it. A short cement rectangle the size and shape of a Semi trailer stretched lengthwise through the wildflowers, the width of the walls as thick as his forearm, protruding up about a foot from the ground and layered on top with thick panes of weathered but passively transparent plexiglass. It was clear that there used to be some sort of fencing around it that had been taken down- inputs for poles set into the short cement walls at regular intervals, rusted bits of metal in the grass around their feet- that for whatever reason had proven to the Foundation to be too problematic to bother keeping up, and in a way it's subtraction made it remarkably camouflaged in plain sight, utterly invisible from the road. Somehow, despite its size, it was truly only something that could be found by accident. 

"This is it?" He asked, and then answered his own question by leaning over the side, looking straight down through the plexiglass, and came to the conclusion all at once that if he had been Dot Zip wandering on Foundation property at night, high on paint thinners and god knows what else, he would have //definitely// thought he was going to die. He thought he was going to die just looking down at it. It almost gave him vertigo, like looking down past the edge into a massive drained swimming pool, as deep as olympic pools were long. Maybe deeper. 

He had no idea. But it was clear that this was it. It was a room of some kind, sunlight bathing the rusting mesh layer several feet below; then below that, immaculately clean walls of thick cement, smooth as titanium; and then at the very bottom, the number {{1}} stenciled into the floor with what clearly used to be red paint. Kilroy looked up, looking for another, one stenciled with the number {{2}}, before realizing that it was probably the class number. 

Class 1. Lockdown. Where Miles was, or where he lived, or whatever state of being this counted as. Looking down into the pit, desperately suppressing notes of the pressurized anxiety he always felt for Miles, it looked a bit like purgatory. 

Kilroy checked his phone again. 1:12, Wednesday.

"When did he say?" Craft asked. 

"1:15," Kilroy said. And the Foundation, he knew, very rarely ran late. Craft laughed a low, robotic noise. 

"Should I leave you two alone? Is this a date?" 

"It's //not// a date," Kilroy said, perhaps and more aggressively than he intended. He dropped his bag on the ground next to the cement wall and took out his laptop, checking the status light on the hardware in his bag as he went. Still green. That reassured him somewhat, until he went to set down his computer on the wall and nearly had a heart attack, having somehow forgotten about the massive covered pit in the five seconds he'd looked away. He paused; took a deep breath; reminded himself about Miles; then, disobeying every inch of everything he'd ever been taught about protecting electronics, set his laptop, which was functionally everything of value that he owned as well as his main means of livelihood, on the edge of what appeared to be the deepest fucking hole in the ground he had ever seen in his life. 

It held effortlessly. Being afraid was exhausting. Kilroy wanted to crawl into bed and sleep for days, or otherwise disappear into his apartment and wait out the Chink crash in a place where the world could not touch him. 

Instead, he opened his laptop and turned on the ereader server terminal, navigated to Miles' communication log, and typed: 

> **killjoykillroy**
> hey we're here

And then immediately wished he could delete it and type something less awkward, because that message seemed very awkward, and he was very scared on multiple levels, some of which he could not pin down enough to name, and he really, //really// wished he was high right now. Either high or asleep. 

Kilroy looked back into the pit. It was empty and still, industrial in a very anti-human way. The longer he spent looking into it, the more it made sense why Miles called the 1st and 2nd class containment wards 'the deep dark'; there was the horrifying sense, looking into it, that this was the highest point, the only section visible to the outside world. 

------

The guards let Miles take his ereader. Didn't let him hold it while they walked, of course- had his hands locked behind his back as usual- but Miles had a theory that in the Foundation, it came to a point where you physically could not contain someone any harder, and you might as well let them have what they want within the limitations of their incredible imposed mundanity. 

They walked him down the hallway and, swiping an ID in the door to the stairwell, began the ascent. 

------

1:15 came and went. 1:16. 1:17. 1:18. 

Mine of Craft had taken to laying in the grass several feet away, idly watching the clouds. Kilroy watched the minutes tick by on his phone and wondered how the hell he wasn't freaking out about this. 

//The Foundation does not run late//, he thought. //If there is one fucking thing in this world that's never late, it's the SCP Foundation//. 

And then, the big barn doors opened.

+ 2: Umbra

++ [x] Umbra 1 

Director Eiler strode from his office down the hall, quickly, quietly, and with purpose. He smiled to a couple sparse people as he passed; took the staircase, the narrow steps down from the administrative offices pressed against the side of the mountain. Dropped down, took them in stride with his hands in his pockets. Hit linoleum of the second floor. Several nods of acknowledgement to passing secretaries, and then through the short maze of proper offices, abandoned since the last shift of the afternoon. The quarter guard change buzz sounded over the intercom as he swung around a corner down another flight of stairs. 

Ground floor. Director Eiler paused at the bottom, finding himself at the edge of the midnight buzz as the time was read over the intercom; it was Agent Wilde’s voice, a floor above, talking into a fat grey microphone in the Site control room. He was reasonably sure that Wilde had been the only one there, or so it seemed when he glanced inward to the monitor-lined room as he passed; he’d seen him with a book out, headset on, illuminated by the backlight of the security camera feeds. Good that it was just him, he thought.

Past the trickle of staff leaving for the night. Rattles of car doors, a playful honk from the parking lot that he barely heard, the faint smell of cool night and non-recycled air. Down another hallway and to the left, the long window-lined corridor to Site medical had been recently repainted the soft green of luna moth wings. Although Eiler liked the color, he thought it clashed with the carefully coordinated Foundation color scheme of primary reds and greyscales in a way he found strangely unsettling. It wasn’t ugly per say; it just felt…civilian. Like it wasn’t important. Like it wasn’t //his//. 

Eiler didn’t like that at all. But he persisted down the corridor to the nurses’ station regardless. 

He had an idea of what he was going to say before he said it: it was something he had had to say plenty of times before. The infirmary was smaller than a normal hospital, and it didn’t take him long to close the gap between the entryway and the lone station; half the lights in the ward were turned off, the ones closest to the darkened rooms of the ward. The night nurse looked up as he approached, and he leaned up against the ledge of the sliding reinforced window separating the waiting area from the station, fingers tapping on the metal overhang. 

He spoke first. “Hey!” he said, friendly enough; they’d met before, but he couldn’t for the life of him remember her name. “I’m sorry about this, but something’s come up on the radio. I don’t suppose you have a tranquilizer on hand?” Tight smile. Good performance.

She looked surprised. It wasn’t hard for him to feign, if not outright nervousness, then a sort of restless underlying agitation betraying a sort of urgency. “We can get a medical team, if you need it—” 

Eiler waved a hand dismissively. “Oh, that won’t be necessary. It’s just a bit of a behavioral issue,” he said, and he said it in the same way he might convey that a force feeding was needed, a subtle crossing of an administrative line. She nodded. 

“Name?” 

“Miles Cuin? He’s in class one.” 

The tranquilizer itself, as she retrieved it from the locked cage in the back shadows of the station, was a thick plastic pen with a protective plunger on the top, the prescription written on a white tag down the side. It was something similar to an epipen in form and function, but had a bit more weight to it; Foundation grade tranquilizers were generally built with slightly more active participants in mind. He smiled politely, thanked her, and portrayed a sense of urgency in his stride until he was out of sight, back around the corner in the moth-wing corridor…and then he slowed. 

The capped autoinjector felt heavy in the pocket of his black slacks. He’d used them before, of course, plenty of times. Hopefully he wouldn’t need it now, but if things went south he figured it would be good to have. 

Down, now, back to the main hallway, then another left, away from the buzz of activity at the entry checkpoint and into the mountain itself. The second checkpoint was at the beginning of the class IV containment zone, and was made of floor to ceiling black cage wire doors, two of them, with a tight holding space in-between. Eiler passed through the first gate with nothing more than a glance and a nod to the guard on duty, who regarded him mildly from the security desk and pressed a button on the touch screen console; the gate opened with a mechanical click, then locked behind him with the slight metallic rattling of chain link. The second gate only needed an ID when coming out. He unlocked the latch with one hand— the squeal of the hinges was infuriating on this gate, but in all his years at Site-54 they’d never managed to fix or replace them— and it swung shut behind him with a slightly heavier metallic clang. The guard didn’t look up from his phone. 

Back to the greyscale and red color scheme. Eiler never felt frightened or even unsettled about walking around in containment wards. In a way, he didn’t understand people who were; he felt almost empowered walking down the dimly-lit low-security chambers and dorms at night, knowing that there was a place for everything and everything in it’s place. Knowing, more than anything, that he had control, perhaps, that people would come to him. It made him feel, 

//important,// Eiler thought. //I’m important. The Foundation chose **me**.// 

And that made him feel as if he had a purpose, just like everything about the Foundation always made him feel as if he had a purpose, and it filled him, always, with a sense of renewed pride in himself, in what he was doing, and in an innate authoritative identity he could not place in words. He found as he walked, then, that the fear of what he was about to do dissipated as the pride warmed his chest; the doubt he had had in himself melted away in the ever-increasing dark, came off like candle wax, like rain off the pines outside, because not only were his actions warranted, they were endorsed. Who was he if he didn’t act on this? Who was he if not the right hand of the Foundation? 

(Who was he? What was he doing? Where would he be without all this…?)

So he was doing what needed to be done. And Eiler thought with some degree of rare self-confidence, as he walked through the cadaver of the empty checkered halls, that even if those above him found out he would not be opposed. Those he was close to in administration felt very similarly to him on many things. If they found out they would have to write down on paper that he was wrong, but they wouldn’t actually //think// he was wrong; and the evidence would get lost, the discipline would be mild, and most importantly he would keep his image intact among them. Bolster it, even. 

Portland Administration wouldn’t turn on him like the people below him would. The people below him in rank, the civilians he saw on the street…none of them understood. They would think badly of him, Eiler thought, if they would find out, which would absolutely be unwarranted concerning the //context// of the thing. And he knew that as much as he despised those below him; as much as he feigned a smile to the civilians on the street; as much as he went through the motions of something conveying sympathy, empathy, compassion more than he thought necessary;

(oh, all the //work// he did to deserve this! how much they didn’t know //that they owed him!//)

he simply could not shake the shattering rejection he would face from them should they find out. It wasn’t that he was guilty at all —Eiler felt that he was really the victim in much of this, actually, a victim struggling against a string of relentless misunderstanding and ostracism, the evidence being that he really //was// miserable— it was just that they would think he was guilty, and in a way that was worse than anything else he could imagine. The pain, the emotional turmoil of being loathed; and all because they just didn’t understand him! All because they didn’t understand the Foundation! Just didn’t get that //this is just how things are done to people who deserve it!//

Really, it was easier to lie should the situation arise. He was obliged to, in fact, and Eiler came to the terminal at the end of the hallway: an aging touchscreen modem set into a narrow outcropping, locked in stiff wire caging. He unlocked the front with a swipe of a spare ID— not his, mind you, but an emergency access card usually locked in a drawer in his office— swung the tiny door open, and swiped the card again, this time at a reader to the left of the monitor. //Level 4 access approved//, the popup said, and in the thin electronic light casting bird cage shadows onto his pressed uniform, he typed in the search bar: 7-8-8-3-9.

One result. He opened the containment file, and navigated to the attached terminal.

The modem turned black. He swung the casing door shut and felt it lock behind him. When the hallway forked into three directions not twenty feet down the corridor, he chose the middle one, walked until the low-security chambers and bunk rooms dissipated into single occupant ones, and reached the class III gate. 

There was no guard on duty here. Guards came in rounds every thirty minutes, and it took another thirty minutes for them to make their way through all the wards. And even if he saw them, or they saw him…Eiler wasn’t terribly concerned about that. They knew who he was. Who would question his intentions? Who would believe any malicious intent, with his demeanor so perfect, so polite? Of course, he repeated to himself that it wasn’t really //malicious//, but they would surely //think// it was malicious, which was ridiculous (he passed through the single set of doors with a swipe of his false ID card) and all because Miles was lying about him, saying that he was someone he wasn’t, well…

//His// people wouldn’t believe that kind of shit, he told himself. But people //did// seem to start hating him out of the blue for no reason at all. He had to attribute that to Miles spreading lies about him, then, because nothing he was being accused of was true, and he was a good person, and an honest man, and anything saying otherwise would be a lie pure and simple.

And as he passed down the class III 10-18 ward, he hated to admit that he //was// anxious, because he wasn’t really anxious about the actual act of what he was about to do. That part to him was already justified; Miles was a liar, and spreading false propaganda about the the director of his site constituted continued uncooperation and hostility. No, it was the possibility of people finding out that kept repeating, endlessly, ceaselessly in his mind: //They’ll hate you for no reason. They won’t understand. They just don’t get the **context** of the thing.// 

It put his mind at ease a bit that if anyone found out, he could blame the Foundation, not him, because Miles deserved to be here and be punished— Miles had killed someone, and had continued to be dangerous. And surely people wouldn’t jump to defend someone who had killed someone, or else that might say something about their own characters, picking the side of a priso— no, he corrected himself, a patient over himself. Over who he truly was. 

Yes, Eiler thought, still running it in circles in his mind, turning it over, feeling the slow cultivation of armor over his motivations: this was right. His initial instinct was correct. After all, the Foundation had chosen him for this position, and they wouldn’t have chosen him if he hadn’t been capable, and most importantly if they didn’t think he could do what had to be done.

++ [x] Two men

Here is a scene recorded on CD in a scorched clear hard shell case, forgotten in one out of a thousand manilla envelopes some time before Korea came and a riot broke out and almost burned down the towering grey Foundation archive building in Quebec: 

Two men in a Foundation interrogation room. It is a recorded scenario so ubiquitous and recognizable that the American public at large has seen it satirized on Saturday Night Live not once, but eight separate times since Korea. This particular record has long been misplaced, divorced from it’s original file and dropped to the bottom of a drawer seven filing cabinets to the left and three upwards, and in this way it’s anonymity, sitting in Qubec among this sprawling dragon’s treasure of untouchable things, could be considered nearly avant garde. 

But. And. Two men in a Foundation interrogation room, with the rain pounding the Portland pavement above just barely detectable on the audio: 

“You know, every single really, truly evil person I’ve ever met has insisted to me that they’re kind.” 

Silence. The man handcuffed to the table is a large man wearing a baseball hat and a black Amazon hoodie. The man across the table is wearing full Foundation guard gear, although only the back plate can be seen. The detained man continues: 

“They say, ‘I was persecuted. I was slandered. I’m kind, you see. I know what’s best for you’. But they only think they’re kind because they don’t have the balls to realize they aren’t, and that nobody truly is. And they keep hurting people, over and over, never considering they might be in the wrong.” 

He looked up, towards the interviewer. There is a long cut, fresh and running with blood, mixing with rainwater from his hair, curling along his jaw. 

“That always hurts the most, ironically. When they can’t admit that they’re wrong, so they just stand there and blame you for everything, and for their own shortcomings. Makes you think you’re going crazy. You get what I mean?” 

"Mister Sears, I really think we should stick to the questions--"

“So. I’ve been detained for…two hours now. I’ve had four different people in here to talk to me, and each one of them I tell them, ‘holy shit, you just killed everyone in my office. You just killed a huge portion of the people in this city,’ and they tell me, ‘you don’t understand, it was for the best. You don’t get it, you’re wrong, we’re in the right here. We’re the good guys. Why do you dislike us?’. Like hell I dislike you people. I don’t like it when people hurt the people I love, and I don’t like having the wool pulled over my eyes, and I don’t like it when I realize how goddamn sick you people are, and that you’ve been planning this all along while we’ve been walking to work and home, and kids were going to school, and you’ve been sitting here in this shitty brick building planning this for //months//, for //years//, and then you have the //audacity// to tell me I’m wrong for disliking you. You people think you’re kind. Swooping in to save the good people of Portland from cybercrime. Rearing up to bash down this new threat...Fuck all of you. Let me go."

But the recording continues for another six hours.

And with that in mind, he reached the deep dark. 

The class II ward was locked down significantly heavier than the previous two, but the heavy metal door opened before he could reach it. Eiler briefly considered retreating down the hall, but realized in the last moment that it would spark more suspicion for him to do so (suspicion of which, he reminded himself, was unfounded), and— in the split second before Agent Palmer appeared with orange guiding lights flickering down his uniform— he relaxed. And smiled. 

“You’re up late,” he said, casually. Palmer nodded politely in response, the great metal doors sliding shut on oiled rails. 

“I am, but I’m on my way out,” he said. The floodlights closest to the gate were on, although the hall was only sporadically lit behind him; it was just enough light to navigate, and enough to leave wide dark diamonds on the scuffed tile. Eiler positioned himself on the edge of the light, hands in his pockets, and nodded to the gate. 

“Nothing wrong, I hope?” 

Palmer shrugged. “Ah,” he said, gesturing to the white metal ereader in his left hand, “nothing terribly serious. I tried to drop this back off with Miles, but for some reason the lock wouldn’t let me in.” He shrugged. 

Eiler raised his eyebrows. “Dropping it off at this hour? I’d think he’d be sleeping.” 

“Well, he was when I checked on him earlier, and I was just going to leave it with him, but…I suppose it can wait until tomorrow. He’ll be disappointed, though.” Palmer’s blonde hair was interrupted around the ears with a streak of white. If it hadn’t caught the floodlight glow where they stood before the deep dark, Eiler wasn’t sure he’d have noticed. “He likes it with him.” 

“He likes his books, I’ve heard,” Eiler said, more to push the conversation along than anything.

Palmer sighed. “Well, that and…Westburo thinks it’s been doing a lot for him recently. In terms of keeping his energy up, I mean.”

Eiler paused. And crossed his arms over his chest. 

“You don’t say?”

++ [x] Castling 

"Did you used to be a person?" 

"I was," said Observer Zero, "But it was a long time ago now." 


"What is the Foundation without technology, Fisher? And what is technology if not a connection between people. A man in the woods lights a fire with a stick, and society rejoices. A man helps a paramilitary organization to make a database for anomalous things, and he's cast into the network and told to be loyal." 

"I remember a time when the level of technology that seeps into our lives was imperceivable. The Foundation knew about us, but what about us? What could we do? Out of the rainbow of designations, what are we but a footnote? A psychic denomination that can interact with technology? What good or harm could we do to them?" 

"But we live in an age where a Type Orange may have more influence than a Type Green. The Foundation feels threatened. They look around themselves and wonder what they've gotten themselves into. If they wanted to protect Foundation intel from technopaths, they would go back to dot-matricies and microfiches, try to subvert rather than destroy. But they didn't do that because they didn't want that. Look at what they've done here. You grew up in those conditions. Anything is a threat to them, everything is seeking to undermine. And they won't stop. And isn't that the soul of containment? Containing a threat under the guise of protection, austerity. Of course there are threats to the world; threats that should be contained. And for a long time before Korea, the Foundation was devoted to addressing those things specifically. But with social and political power comes the right to abuse. And that's what they've done here."

++ [x] a foundation 

Director Eiler stood just inside the chamber with self-imposed austerity that made Miles feel hollow with shame for having been asleep when he'd entered the room. The fluorescent lights came sudden and painful and he almost dismissed it as a dream until: 

"Wake up, Cleaver." 

Miles laid there, blinking hard. Eiler dropped his ereader onto the blankets, the screen blank and dead. He reached out with a black pit in his stomach and flipped it over. Six tiny screws dropped out onto the blankets and skittered onto the floor. In the upper third of incomprehensible electronic innards, there was a gaping hole where something had been removed. 

"Get dressed," Eiler said, "now." 

"Please don't," Miles said, although he did not know what he was pleading against, and his voice came out groggy and strained. He had suspected Eiler would find out, but deep down hoped he wouldn't. There was a kind of primal fear lent to not knowing the consequences in their entirety; of being offered, constantly, the vague allusion to eventual pain like an incoming weight, not hurting but always pressing; the certainty only that at provocation Eiler would not hesitate to take and not stop taking. Anything. Everything. Whatever he still had.

Talking to Kilroy had made him feel brave. Writing had made him feel brave; saying that he did not like all this made him feel like he had a chance. It felt detached from these consequences that he did not understand, gave him control over the apathy that threatened to pull him under. But the time had come, and with it came the unprecedented terror of this russian roulette of taking, and aside from the ereader-- which had just been taken, shot one with five more in the barrel-- Miles had nothing left to lose. And if he had nothing left to take, Eiler would simply take something else. Something less material this time.

He should have died, he thought. He should have cut deeper.

"I wasn't giving you an option," Eiler said, cooly, strongly, almost smugly. "I told you to get dressed." 

Miles did. His heart was pounding and he said nothing. No question he could ask would get him an answer. He pulled one of the uniform red jumpsuits from the chest at the end of the bed and zipped it up to it's encroaching collar. Eiler watched him patiently, leaning against the brick wall beside his bed, steady and calm and oh so carefully poised. Miles swallowed. The zipper pinned itself on the soft flesh of his windpipe with just enough pressure to remind him who he was, and where he was, and exactly how much freedom he was allowed. 

"Against the wall," Eiler said. Although there was no clock to tell him what time it was, no sun to show him daybreak, Miles suspected it was early because Eiler had broken the delicate cycle of time suspended in the deep dark: he had turned the lights on, and there was no clattering of a single metal cart outside, no sounds of guards in the hallway, and no time between the turning on of the ward lights and the opening of his own chamber door where he could dress quickly and sit motionless on the edge of the bed with his eyes closed, counting the opening and closing of airlocks on their sleek submerged rails, reminding himself that there were people around him, people he could not see. 

He stood against the wall with his hands behind his back and listened. Listened for anything. A shout, a laugh, the sound of an alarm, if nothing else an indication that this could be a breach, the most recognizable Foundation ritual and as regular as seasonal monsoons. 

But Eiler's breath came even and careful as he handcuffed his wrists behind his back and led him into the black silence beyond the shore of his chamber. Shadows cast with red. Faded paint on arching cathedral walls. Hummings of machinery in the bedrock of the mountain as clear as prayer. 

Miles shivered. The tiny running lights only illuminated the bottom half of the ward corridor. Without being able to see the ceiling, he suddenly felt immeasurably small, and when the door to his chamber closed behind them there was a faint memory of a time before this was all he knew, a memory of his mother teaching him to swim, of sitting in the shallow end of a hotel pool looking out into a silent warped world. 

Eiler jerked him forward. Red light on a pressed white dress shirt; reflections on the tips of his hair. To his horror they were not going up towards the big steel doors marking the beginning of the ward. They were going down.  

The containment bay did not have steps; it sloped gradually towards the nadir of the mountain. A single inset rail ran down the middle of the hallway, thin enough to step over, gleaming parallel to peeling caution tape and the faint running lights. Miles supposed it was intended to transport heavy equipment, but he had never seen it used. In the dark it lay sunken into the tiles like a spine.

"Oh, Miles, what //will// we do with you..."

He could not see Eiler's mouth move in the dark, but the words pooled in the vacant space and echoed just enough to be drowned out by the sound of stale air coursing through the vents above. The older man's right hand pressed hard against his handcuffs, fingers splayed over his wrists as if they held down the wings of a small bird. For a moment Miles wondered if he could even see, and then wondered if he could just kick him and run in the other direction, although what he would do once he got to the big steel doors he did not know, and who would hear him at this hour he was not sure, and who would even care he could not imagine.

"I don't know," Miles said. The blackness swallowed the words. Another memory, this time from an article in a digital encyclopedia he'd read a year before: //The lighting in deeper cave systems constitutes a phenomenon called 'cave darkness', a condition where so little light exists to penetrate the mammalian cornea that human vision cannot adjust...//

"You don't know what to do with yourself?" Eiler said. Even with the running lights glowing along the corridor, it suddenly dawned on him that in the disorienting dark he could not tell which airlock was his. "You seemed to have quite the agenda in that manifesto of yours." 

"So you've read it," Miles said. 

"I have. Very articulate, I may add. Says good things about the Foundation's education system." 

"I don't have anything else to do aside from read all the time. That's not much of an education system." 

"Then who taught you to write, Miles? Tell me." His right hand tightened on Miles' wrists. There was a shift in tone implying he was being generous, a slight, angry implication that he was lucky to be able to speak at all. Miles pretended not to notice this. 

"My dad did," he said. Eiler huffed. 

"It's a shame about all this, then. You could have been talented."

Miles inhaled. And slowly exhaled. Suddenly he felt exhausted. "...Where are you taking me?"

"Oh, I touched a nerve there, I see," Eiler chuckled. "Must have gotten you up on the wrong side of the bed." 

"It's..." Miles wanted to say a time, but he had no idea. "...It's really early." 

"It is."

"You're not the only one with a tragic backstory, you know," Eiler called over his shoulder. "My father was a college professor. Taught classics, of all things. He was also one hell of an alcoholic..." 

Miles heard a metal cabinet ram shut with a loud BANG. Something fell into the washbasin and thudded like dead weight. "When I was ten, he got into a drunk driving accident. They took him to the hospital and had him in with a shrink-" his voice suddenly was sharper against the tile and metal of the room, facing towards him now, "-and the shrink told him, 'you know, it seems like your problems are ingrained in your identity, sir. Your //personality//, if you will. If you can find a core for yourself, some sort of //foundation// instead of resorting to whatever this is, you might do a lot better for yourself'". 

There was the sound of polished black dress shoes turning swiftly, then clacking like hooves on the polished white laminate, walking back towards the chair. "//Well!// My father never liked unsolicited advice from strangers to begin with, but that got to him. He waited damn near six months to get out of there, and in that time he decided exactly what kind of core he wanted." 

And then he was in his line of vision, smiling placidly like he always had. Miles squirmed against the leather restraints, and he disappeared again, reammerging with the careful insertion of an IV needle into the inside of his right elbow. Miles sucked in a breath. His gloved hands were exceedingly cold. 

"He came home. Can't you believe?" Eiler continued, circling back around to the front of the chair, then ripping the sterile plastic from a syringe. "He passed all the psychiatric evaluations from thereon out. Detoxed, even..." Eiler trailed off. The vial of liquid was so small Miles couldn't make out the color until it was being pulled, millimeter by millimeter, up into the needle and the syringe beyond. Eiler tapped it carefully against the side of the glass tube, then held the plunger between his teeth and began to roll the sleeves of his pressed white dress shirt up to the elbow. In the sharp clinical light, the pale undersides of his forearms were littered with straight wisps of scars, lined like the braces of a railroad track. 

"I really should have thought to do this beforehand," he spoke around the syringe, then finished buttoning the cusps and removed it, holding it delicately in his right hand. "I apologize. Can't be good clinical practice to hold it like that. But as I was saying." 

Before Miles had a moment to brace himself, the needle was in one of the pale blue veins of his left hand. He instinctively jerked what wasn't pinned under a wrist restraint; without a moment's hesitation, Eiler slammed his fingers under the tip of the tan armrest and held them there, forcing his palm down cool and steady, emptying the remainder of the contents into back of his grip. With his body pinned down, it was easier for Miles to realize he was trembling. The substance burned in a way that wasn't explicitly painful, but left a sort of numbness in its wake that made a pit open in his stomach.

"He came home from the hospital. And detox. He told me about the shrink," Eiler pulled the syringe out and walked somewhere behind him to dispose of it. Miles realized, vaguely, that although Eiler's hands were gone, his own was still gripping the chair tightly, as if he was willing whatever it was to stop the inch-by-inch creeping of heat up his arm. 

And then Eiler reappeared, now in the form of a hand around his lower jaw, bracing him forwards against the forehead restraint. Miles met his eyes, cool and calm; and then he drifted them down to Eiler's throat, and realized with a sense of detached horror that he had loosened his tie.

"You know what he said?" Eiler muttered. 

Miles could not respond. Whatever it was had travelled up to his neck now, creeping down his torso, coursing through his capillaries. He had never wanted something to stop more in his entire life. He had never wanted something to be a nightmare more.

"'If I'm going to build a foundation, I'm going to build it from the wreckage of you,'" Eiler whispered. And then smiled. And then took his hand away. 

Miles swallowed. There was a vague awareness of the jumpsuit zipper pressing against his windpipe, gently, softly, present. Eiler stepped back. 

"And then he did." 

The reality cycler roared to life. It occured to Miles that he was going to die.

++ [x] Doberman Executioner 

Flashes. Miles sees flashes from the machine to his right, then feels them behind him eyes, popping in the front of his skull, then ricocheting pain, and then Draven stands on a cold overhead catwalk and looks down on the crowd below and is afraid.  

In. Out. Benjamin Kondraki fades from his mind and Alto Clef sets in, telling him he does not have to feel to shoot, and he does not have to think to finish a job. //That's how he killed all those kids,// he thinks. //He just was, and then they weren't.//

His body relaxes. The warmth in his chest is the feeling one gets with certainty, stability, a meaning. He remembers a time when he could think while doing these jobs, when his morals lined up with his soul and certainties. Not anymore. His job has changed since Korea. Now, his job is simply to be. 

And Draven Kondraki would be. 

------

Although Miles does not physically hear the loud cracking sound he hears it mentally, like an electric shock, like something has wormed into one ear and whipped itself against bone. He feels tranquilized all at once; static on his tongue, invading his mouth, burning his teeth. Thinking becomes a struggle. There are small black dots at the edges of his vision and he slumps in the restraints slightly, then hauls himself upwards, pushes his back into the chair, groggily begs himself not to pass out, although it feels less like he wants to pass out and more like he wants to shrink his soul away and fall into a sleep as dark and smooth as the Marianas Trench. 

He wants to sleep. Eiler woke him up, he remembers. He's been so tired lately. He wants to go back to sleep...

And then there is a hand around his jaw, pushing him back against the headrest, tilting up upwards...yes, up to the moths in the overhead lights. 

"There are no dogs in the deep dark," the figure says, the shadow, the white tooth tiles of god, "That's one high. And now we go low..." 

------

A single shot from the overhead catwalk. The girl's head explodes into unrecognition. A memory from when he was eight surfaces, vaguely, in the back of his mind: his father saying humans take a tenth of a second to react to anything. Draven applies this tenth of a second. He drops the sniper rifle and starts to run as the crowd is recoiling, and as he runs he hears the sounds of more shots from the wings, from inside the crowd, from the imposters that have invaded this space with such precision. 

------

"There are no sharks in the water," says a voice. It's his father's. They are looking out over the shale beach, the dark sea, the churning tide. Seagulls wheel and cry above them. His father says, "Do you hear me, Miles? There are no sharks in the water." 

Miles says, "Yes there are," and the vision disappears, up, back up, back to the chair where he is not certain Eiler said 'sharks' or 'water', and he is not certain of much at all, or even if the dark shadow outlined along the wall beyond his television static vision is anyone he knows, and then he is up again; another crack, this one louder; a nip of electricity at his tongue. His head is pushed back again. The palm of a hand is on his windpipe, inches above the zipper on his collar. The hume change is faster this time. He wants to beg and his jaw will not move.

"...And high again," Eiler says. His train track forearms. Miles realizes in his peripheral that he's sweating profusely through his jumpsuit, that it's running down his face and dripping from the tip of his nose. "You see how this works? There's a process here, Miles--" and the rest is drowned out by the buzzing of the hume field and the high, sharp crack of reality in his ears...

------
[DRAVEN AGAIN]

------
He's holding him on the precipice of a steep cliff, dust and blue sky and noone to hear him scream. Eiler leans in. 

"There is no broken masquerade, Miles," he said, "There was no Korea. Do you hear me, Miles? You've been tricked. Lied to. I need you to listen to me." A tightening around his throat. Hot tears in his eyes. "This is the best you'll ever get, you see? There is no life for you outside of here. Now I want you to say it with me..." 

A low, animal whine chokes up from his throat, thick with terror. 

"Say it with me, now. 'There is no revolution because there is no broken masquerade'."

"Please stop," he sobs, "Please stop..."

Draven wanted this to stop.

A stranger with a straight black cane walks in step down the hallway of the new regional authority building.

There were dead moths trapped in the rectangular overhead lights. The room was cold. He had opened his eyes and had been. 

"My psychologist says I should stop the nightmare here, you know. Try to change the ending, or jerk myself out of it." 

Eiler tightened the forehead restraint. Against his windpipe, the light pressure of a zipper. On his right hand, a scar from a cut he'd gotten fixing shingling on their house five years ago. He exhaled. 

"I noticed that," Eiler said, "but I'm still here, aren't I? And you're still here. With your medications, it would seem that it's almost...intentional, you letting me do this to you."
Inhale. Exhale. He was shaking. 

"I have a family now, Dean," Miles said. "I can't go around...cutting myself anymore."

"So you're letting the nightmares come. I would think that's unusually masochistic of you." 

"Some habits are hard to break." 

"The habit of internal turmoil," Eiler said, "The ritualistic breaking and reforming of the self..." 

"It's hard for me to be scared of you when you talk like that, you know."
 
"I would think it would be hard for you to be scared at all knowing this is a dream." 

"I think Kilroy would beg to differ." 

"He'll wake you up?" 

"Not until he comes to bed," Miles said, "That gives us a few hours."

Eiler smiled. "I'll make this fast, then."

"There's no need for that." 

"So you really //do// want this to hurt." 

Miles was quiet for a second. "No. I want to feel something. That's different from wanting to hurt for the sake of hurting."

"How is that different?" 

"Apathy versus self-loathing."

------

//"Miles..."//

Something shook him. Some//one// shook him. 

He opened his eyes to orange lamplight and strands of long blond hair turning white at the temples; to the feeling of sweat beading at the nape of his neck and a hand on his shoulder. Carefully, steadily. Kilroy does not pull him out on his own, but he is something graspable; Miles reaches for him, peels back the layers of himself, and ever so slowly crystallizes from the solution of dreams. 

"Hey..." Kilroy's voice sounds worried. Miles didn't mean to worry him. He's breathing, but the breaths are fast and his chest is tight and hot and compressed; he goes about trying to slow it, if for no other reason than to stop worrying Kilroy, and he isn't sure why he has to worry Kilroy so goddamn much, and why Kilroy works so fucking hard for him trying to calm him down, rubbing his back and talking to him, Kilroy with his glasses still on from coding half of the night, and these thoughts only made it harder for him to breathe in the grand scheme of things, and then Miles was crying, 


"I'm gonna wait for you on the shore," Kilroy said. 

"You don't have to be my lifeguard." 

"I never said I was. But if you don't come up for air I'm coming in after you." 

"I'll always come back up."

"And you always have. But sometimes I see you and you're just..." Kilroy paused. "...I think you're in deeper than you tell me." 

"Kilroy," Miles said, "I told you. I'll always come back from... wherever I go." 

"You'll keep coming back until you don't," Kilroy said. "And sometimes I'm afraid you won't."

"I promise I'll let you know if that time comes." 

"No, you won't," Kilroy said. "You say you will, but you won't. You never have. Sometimes I wish you'd just tell me."

"Kilroy," he said, "I'm not suicidal." 

"You're self-harming, though." 

Miles froze. Kilroy stretched and yawned.

"Wait," Miles said. "Wait. You can't know that. I'm not--"

"--You're not cutting, I know. But you have like, a look, dude. Like, a vibe. I don't know." 

"I have a self-harm //vibe?//"

"Miles," Kilroy said, "Babe. we've been married for like, eight years. We have a house and a child. I am //very// attuned to your vibes." 

"I know you are! I just... didn't think I had vibes for specific actions." 

"Well, to be fair, I wouldn't call self-harming a specific action," Kilroy said. "But it's like, a state of mind, you know? Like, you get all lost in thought and stuff and you usually are, so that's fine, but then you get all tense. It's a state of like...eating at yourself, and then eating at yourself in ways that hurt you. It's kind of like you're in pain."

"...//Really?//" 

"You can't measure your own vibes?" 

"I can barely tell when I'm hungry and you expect me to detect my chakras?"

"I mean, to be fair on the front of actions, aside from the self harm vibe you also have a vibe for when you badly want to eat shredded cheese out of your hand like a horse."

"You must be detecting that constantly." 

"It's not just when you're brain wants to eat shredded cheese out of the bag like a horse, babe. It's when your //soul// wants to eat shredded cheese out your hand like a horse."

"I adore the implication that eating shredded cheese out one's hand like a horse is a state of mind constituting a vibe of it's own."

"It is. You get a special spring in your step. It's adorable. But that's beside the point."
