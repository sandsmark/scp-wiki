[[tab A Note About My Future: 8/17/2019]]

As of today- August 17th, 2019- I'm going to try not to write for the wiki anymore, or to interact with the community anymore. I'm doing this in an attempt to get serious about my writing IRL and possibly get into a well-known writing Master's program in my state in a couple years, once I graduate from college. To do this, I need to build a portfolio, and I need to stop writing only for SCP. While I remain as invested in it as I have been, I feel like I can't fully commit myself to taking my original writing seriously. I need to make the jump and force myself to swim.

Roget once told a friend of mine that he wished this site could be a jumping off point for writers as opposed to a permanent fixture in their writing. This place has been a great help for me over the past 7 to 8 years and I'm grateful for the drive it gave me while I had it. It gave me something to reach for, and now I need to reach for other things. 

I will be deleting all my SCP drafts off my personal wikidot site and all my non-early-RP SCP posts off my tumblr (of which there are probably hundreds). I'm keeping all my AO3 stuff up as well as all my articles here on the wiki. I won't delete this account, but I'm going to sign out of it and try not to sign back in unless an emergency arises. 

To fully cut myself off, I need to post what I have finished of the project I've been working on for the past year. I'm going to reparent the chapter I have posted to this page instead of the Broken Masquerade hub, and I'm going to delete that page from the hub itself. In the next tab, I'm going to post what I had of that project, back to back. It was not finished, and you'll notice that many parts of it are missing, but I liked where I got with certain aspects of it, especially the chapter //Umbra//. I also really like my OCs, and might put them in some of my off-site stuff going forward. 

As nervous as I am, I'm also feeling excited for what the future could hold for me, and for the budding original projects I have going. I'm optimistic about my future. My goal is to eventually get something published, and then my loftier goal is to make it into that Master's program. If I end up like, getting anything published, I might post a notice here. 

Write boldly and bravely, everyone!!
-Van

[1] It aired on C-Span.

May 2025

Which political party stood for which side of the issue on the congress floor is ultimately irrelevant. It passed senate with a slim majority vote, then tumbled around capitol hill for a month before the hearing date was set. It was a nervous time. There were many unanswered questions of the very legal type that do not matter to those this bill affects, questions like is the Foundation a privatized organization? and how will this affect the no anomalous prison system? and do anomalous persons have rights? And because the people were scared and the men in suits are even more so, many of the specifics become glossed over in the way they are in politics. There was a word change here, a specifically worded statement there. There were many people who saw things they then pretend not to have seen. There were meetings with Foundation officials, and most importantly there was money passed around through the discreet budgetary veins of a large and incomprehensible machine, and then it was on the congress floor, and it aired on C-Span.

The bill was exactly 1,652 pages long. It was that long because it was the first of its kind. The money to pay came from the U.S. Military budget, and there was some huffing about this as well as long term fiscal outlooks and staff for the new Sites, but the fine print had been scavenged more than anything on capitol hill had been in decades into text that bound like barbed wire, stung like task force tasers, pounded like chamber doors slamming in bright fluorescent lights. The marble floor of congress gleamed mercilessly. A couple representatives stood at the podium and give strange, wandering speeches of the same breed given by the willfully ignorant. Yes, no. Maybe.

The Foundation sent one, too.

She stood outside the hearing room in her dark tailored suit, plugging one ear with a finger to better hear her cell phone. Unlike many of those expressing their opinions on the stand inside, Andrea Adams had spent many sleepless nights going over the 1,652 pages of this document, and was one of the fewer still who understood the full ramifications.

“They’ve made changes,” she said, distancing the phone a few inches from her left ear as the squabbling started. The person on the other end wasn’t technically supposed to have access to these documents, but even in retirement, he couldn't help but stay close and express his opinions. Four decades of working with Type Greens will make one attentive to anything major pertaining to that line of work passing in congress.

“What kind of fucking changes?!” Alto Clef guffawed down the line from somewhere north of Phoenix, Arizona. His leaked version of the document was from two months before, and was only around 1,000 pages. The extra 652 really make a difference, Andrea thought. God, what didn’t they change.

“Okay,” she said, slowly, “Don’t freak out, but they added 500 pages.”

There was an exasperated sigh from the other end.

“God, what a fucking shitshow!” Clef roared. “This is what I fucking said, didn’t I? If it ever went to congress…fucking…Jesus! God! For fuck’s sake!”

“It gets worse,” she said, “They want to contain them from birth.”

“They want screenings probably, too, right? Pre-natal detection and shit?” She could practically hear the years coming of his life. With any mercy from god he might have a heart attack before this passes, Adams thought. Put him out of his misery.

“They do,” Andrea confirmed. That was buried somewhere in the extra 652, where all the messy details were. The tech itself had existed for the better part of a decade. With the new Kant counters, an anomalous infant could be confirmed at as young as the second trimester. The wonders of science and all that.

“God…” He said, breathless. She half-expected to hear the wheeze of a respirator, some kind of indication that Alto Fucking Clef might be on his way out of this world at last, but all she heard was the sound of him collapsing melodramatically into an armchair.

“Enjoying retirement yet?” she teased.

Clef laughed bitterly. “Enjoying that I don’t have to be the one talking to senators.”

“I’m sure they’re enjoying not having to talk to you, either, if it’s any consolation," she smiled wearily. “They know you, by the way. Or they know of you, at least. Your signature is on a lot of papers.”

“Damn right it is!” With a chill, Adams realized she could hear the C-Span hearing coming through a TV on his end of the line. “They should know what I think by now, then.”

“Yeah,” she whispered. Alto’s opinion on Type Green control went undiscussed between them. He wasn’t a man that had ever been subtle about his thoughts in that regard.

“…Do you want to hear my prediction?”

Andrea heard the current speaker taking questions in the room behind her, and shuffled the papers in her hands nervously, pressing the phone between her ear and her shoulder. Opening remarks, the body of what she wanted to say; running through her notes about a new era, now. “I’m up next. I can’t talk for much longer-”

“If this passes, they’ll tear you all apart.”

He hung up.

Andrea would think over that line a lot in the coming decades. The sudden coldness in his voice implied what she already suspected: he knew she, his own former apprentice, had helped write this bill. He knew that she had especially had a hand in the final 600 pages, the damning final third. And more than anything, Alto Clef had suspected it damn near all along that she wouldn’t adhere to the mantra he’d lived by all 50 years of his career: kill them all.

So he wouldn’t have been surprised then, Adams thought, when he watched her take the stand in congress to give what had become the Foundation’s final word on the matter. Prenatal screenings at public health clinics, and entry of results into a database. A Foundation ‘Retainment Agent’ assigned to each child to preform social worker roles. Close monitoring. Rights to contain regularly through childhood if needed. Rights to separate them from others, rights to be careful, rights to be oh, oh so careful. More funding to build the humanoid sites and containment centers they needed to hold a generation of anomalous children, not just Type Greens anymore, hopefully growing up in a better, safer world.

Alto Clef did not call back afterwards. Adams suspected he had said all he felt he had to say.

[2] …and the nadir was cold and cruel.

March 2028

Placing Foundation sites was a nightmare before Korea, but this brave new world did not care where the designated 24 new humanoid sites were to be placed, and for that matter neither did most of the Americans watching this unfold. They rose across the country steady and fast. People- regular people, people who knew little and assumed plenty- watched them go up in the distant periphery of their daily lives with the detachment of someone believing it’s for the best. Life changed very little. Foundation patrol cars still sped along back freeways, kicking up dust in smoky trails. Notes on the third page of the local newspaper. Hey Susan, have you seen that thing they’re putting up where the Winston’s farm used to be?

In Oregon, it rose 45 minutes outside of Portland, in the Cascade mountain range. The equipment vans rumbled off the interstate onto gravel backroads that snaked through damp pines and Douglas firs, splashed in puddles and rocked side to side on the precarious terrain. The Foundation Jeeps wore their back tires uneven where the guns rested in the trunk with tire chains and emergency flares. This is where Site-54 rose: 1,200 feet above sea level, a fifteen minutes from the nearest town, and deep enough in the wilderness that very few outsiders had the opportunity to gawk at the newest local attraction as the rest of America had done with their own.

54 was a ribcage. The main wings thrust partially into the mountainside with steel rebar and drilling machines, and what wasn’t encased in stone sprawled outwards in a sprawl against the rock: several outbuildings, a large recreation yard lined with chain link, part of a medical wing, an armory, a dormitory building, a small office building, and a parking lot with a loading bay. The 500 horsepower Scranton reality anchor- a menacing black mechanical giant tucked in among the spacious subterranean containment wards- was the first piece of large equipment to be plugged in once the site was added to municipal power.

All of this was rather overwhelming to Walter Wilde, Foundation Retainment Agent.

He parked his car- a tan Saturn with the Foundation logo plastered along the sides- and leaned forward in his seat. The site had been open a couple months now, and he still couldn’t help but look up at the dark rock and faux wood siding when he pulled in. Huge. Absolutely fucking huge.

[3] Sisyphus
If there had been a time where the Foundation Pacific Regional Administration building didn’t stand on the corner of the intersection three blocks from the park he played in as a child, on the outskirts of the northern part of Portland overlooking the decay it had come to cause, Kilroy Fisher didn’t know it.

He’d seen it first when he was thirteen. He was sure he had had to have seen it before then, before the containment protocol went up and the city he’d lived in since he was four became something very different, but the first time he saw it and remembered it was when he was that age: the big brick building with adornments at the top like a great oak bookcase, the antique facade marred with barbed wire along the edges of the attached parking garage. It was the good part of the north side of Portland. The potholes were filled right away.

Sears took him there. If it had been anyone else but Sears, his mother’s ex boyfriend and someone with a certain amount of presence in the anomalous underground, as well as a generally imposing person— Sears was a tall fat man who, although generally amiable, was known for reacting to Foundation shakedowns with a certain amount of unbridled rage— he probably would have been more afraid than he was.

“I want to show you where I used to work,” he’d said, and they had been on the side of town by coincidence, although for the life of him Kilroy could not remember what it had been. The security cameras on the Portland Administration building had traced them as they passed. A time before the building was a time without the cameras, too, and he remembered seeing Sears walk so stiffly by, positioning himself closer to the great red box on the intersection, putting Kilroy on his right hand side closest to the opposite storefront, shops not for them and full of things they could not afford. They walked quickly. Kilroy had tried to get a better look one they’d been three quarters of the way down the street. Sears had responded with one big hand between his shoulder blades.

“Don’t let them get your face,” he’d said, and they’d kept walking.

The building that used to house the Amazon office sat two blocks away from Portland Administration. It always confused Kilroy how Sears had managed to go to work every day so close to it, passing it even, somewhere in a very different world where the tech incubators had been something other than abandoned, when there had been a lot more people and a lot fewer drugs. Sears told him before that he hadn’t always hated the Foundation like he did. He said he remembered even before the barbed wire went up that that wasn’t an unpopular opinion.

“You used to work here?” he’d asked, a bit taken aback. Unlike the ruins of the tech incubators on the northwest side, the old Amazon office had been repurposed instead of abandoned; it seemed to still be an office building, but Kilroy could see traces of the flashy stylistic choices typically chosen by large successful corporations with money to spend and stockholders to impress: geometric overhangs, wide windows, solar panels on the roof, faux wood paneling right inside the door. The building had an uncharacteristic smoothness, a modern styling made to look distinctive, carefully styled to fit something that had long abandoned it. It looked like a definition without a word.

He couldn’t imagine Sears of all people working in a place like this. Sears, who ran the Phreaker club out of an abandoned laptop assembly center on the outskirts of Portland, who he associated strongest with ebook publications and certain street drugs. Sears, who he’d never seen wear a shirt without a hole in it, who would not tolerate Foundation agents on his property despite them coming out at least two weekends every month. Sears, in a time far away when he was too young to remember, walking to work at the fancy modern Amazon office two blocks from Portland Administration; striding past and not being afraid of the cameras and going the same way home; getting paid, he imagined, on the regular, probably on not too bad of a salary.

Sears laughed and nodded. “I worked with the Kindle,” he said. “Man, at the time…we were about to launch a new one with a holographic screen. ‘Kindle Air’ is what they called it. It was gimicky as fuck looking back, but we were all obsessed with getting it right, you know? The first round of beta testing went well, but we were all terrified. Corporate wanted it done by the holidays. We had a month left and hit a bug with the battery. Like, it was functional, but it could be better and we wanted it to be better, so…”

He paused. Kilroy felt a tightening in his gut.

“…I mean, like, there were a lot of us working overnight, is what I’m trying to say,” Sears said tentatively, “I was running a test on the software. There were about five people around me, all like us. Must have been an hour to midnight. I wanted to go home and shower and change, so I was like, ‘you know, I’ll be back in a few hours. You guys keep going’. And you know Kilroy? They did. They sure fucking did keep going.”

He paused again. The building suddenly looked very empty, and very cold.

“And they died,” Kilroy said, almost as a question.

“They died,” Sears said, “and lemme tell you, kid, I’ve never seen investors pull out so fast.”

Somewhere far away, a dog was barking.

[4] In Which the City of Portland Puts a Legal Limit on the Number of Hair Straighteners One Person can Purchase at Once

As Mobile Task Force Commander Draven Kondraki squinted down at the charred hair straightener at the Portland police department, it occurred to him all at once that he had absolutely no idea what the kids were doing these days.

At least, it was clear that it had been a hair straightener at one time, before half of the clamp had been torn off and the resulting wires duck taped at the base. Even through his latex gloves he could tell it was sticky on the handle. The chord, which miraculously was still attached, ran across the examination table to what he vaguely guessed was a battery. The plug had been removed and the chord hotwired on manually. The whole contraption had been in a confiscated backpack. In all his years of action the amount of ingenuity drugs brought out of people continued to shock and amaze.

"And you…I mean, they…" he gestured vaguely at the head of the straightener, which was coated in a sheen of black tar.

"They burn it on themselves, yes," said his Lieutenant, "into the skin. It's a high-heat topical application."

That would have to hurt, Draven thought. "It's an analgesic, I hope?"

She shook her head. "It's a stimulant. More like cocaine than opiates."

"And kids still want to do this."

She looked at him strangely. "You're not very accustomed to the Type Orange crowd, are you?"

"I work more in the realm of Greens myself," he said, setting the contraption back down. "Oranges are technopaths, right?"

"That's right. There's a large population here," she said. "Portland used to be the Silicon Valley of the 20s' and 30s'.”

He raised an eyebrow. ‘Used to be?’

‘The city paired up with the Foundation to curb cybercrime a decade or so back,’ she said. ‘They weren’t too happy about it.’

‘You put containment procedures on the city of Portland?’

‘Not containment procedures,’ she said. ‘An ongoing initiative.’

‘Right.’ Draven ran two fingers under the chord, idly following it back to the hot wired battery. The tarry stickiness tapered off to a dusty, gritty feeling. ‘And the initiative was…’

‘Well, type oranges exert psychic control over electronics. So the thought was to inhibit that connection,’ she said. ‘Regional control decided to try an experimental technology. The effects were more neurologically severe than we anticipated when it went live. Foundation sentiment hasn’t been very positive around here since.’

‘Foundation sentiment hasn’t been very positive anywhere lately,’ Draven muttered.

‘Jesus, you can say that again.’

Draven’s fingers had reached the battery. It was a black, blocky contraption about the size of his hand, with a conspicuous silver switch at the top.

[5] KILROY + MAXWELLIAN
Crafter Of Mine

"Mekhane's got plans for you, dude," Crafter Of Mine said. "I had a dream last night, man."

"What did he say?"

"What did they say, man. Gender doesn't exist in the void, remember?"

"Right, right. What did they say?"

"Mostly a bunch of static, but like, it was directed at you. Like, they were pinging you, dude. Like, spiritually." He put a hand over his heart. "Pinging the username in your soul, man…"

"You are really, really high, Craft."

"I always smoke weed after I see the Mekhane, dude! It's intense as hell! I've been vaping since 4AM! I haven't even checked my messages yet!"

[6] a bending of reality
January 2034

She arrived at the hospital in six pieces. Her 6-year-old son arrived to Site-54 in one. Her husband stood sleepless in the kitchen of the big dark house and unplugged the crockpot she'd left running, then walked out the back door, down through the sandy soil of the backyard to the sharpened shale shoreline, and in the wake of seagulls wheeling overhead in the dimming light decided who to love.

It did not take long. The dark nearly escaped him.
