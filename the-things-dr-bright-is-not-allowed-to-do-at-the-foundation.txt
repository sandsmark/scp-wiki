title:The Things Dr Bright Is Not Allowed To Do At The Foundation
**Revised List**

1) Dr Bright is not allowed to feed anything with peanut butter to Kain.

2) Telling new researchers that you can tame [[[SCP-682 |682]]] with a rolled up newspaper and a tummy rub is right out.

3) No longer allowed to challenge Abel to unwinnable games like tic-tac-toe. It was three weeks before Abel conceded a draw.

4) [[[SCP-018]]] is not to be taunted!

5) [[[SCP-808 |808]]]/[[[SCP-105 |105]]] is never going to happen. Let it go.

6) Giving [[[SCP-113 |113]]] to Diogenes is just plain pointless.

7) Attempting to disprove [[[SCP-343 |343]]], //to// 343, is a horrible idea. Agents are still studying the resulting paperweight; supposedly so heavy that 343 should not be able to lift it.

8) There is no viable situation in which [[[SCP-816]]] should be used for "The Time Warp."
