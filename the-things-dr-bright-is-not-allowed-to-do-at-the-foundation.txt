1) Dr. Bright is not allowed to feed anything with peanut butter to Kain.

2) Telling new researchers that you can tame [[[SCP-682]] with a rolled up newspaper and a tummy rub is right out.

3) No longer allowed to challenge Able to unwinnable games like tic-tac-toe. It was three weeks before Able conceded a draw.

4) [[[SCP-018]]] is not to be taunted!

5) Giving [[[SCP-113 |113]]] to Diogenes is just plain pointless.

6) Attempting to disprove [[[SCP-343 |343]]], //to// 343, is a horrible idea. Agents are still studying the resulting paperweight, supposedly so heavy that 343 should not be able to lift it.

7) While it is true that "No one expects the SCP Inquisition!", that is only because there is no such thing.

8) Dr. Bright is not king of anywhere.

8.1) Neither is he queen of anywhere.

12.1) Not even if Dr. Palmer asks nicely.

13) There is no market for SCP brand pornography.

15.1) Should not replace Dr. Rights marital aids with a 'novelty' aid shaped like a lamp.

16) The Better Business Bureau is not the correct agency for dealing with containment failures from horrible eldritch artifacts sold by Marshall, Carter, and Dark.

17) Dr. Bright must never come in contact with anyone under the age of 18. --Let him contact them. It's the only way they'll learn.-- Just because it is a learning experience, does not mean anyone needs to come in contact with Bright.

18) Any requests by Dr. Bright to utilize [[[SCP-212]]] for enhancement are to be denied, due to several requests being submitted with the research goal stated as "to stick my privets in it and hope for the best."

20) Dr. Bright is not allowed to bargain with personnel for their "souls" if they are unaware of [[[SCP-158]]].

24.2) Nor are you allowed to create and wear hats made using or out of various anomalous objects. We understand that your [[[SCP-894]]] top hat collection has some tactical value, but that is not a valid reason to wear them in the presence of other researchers.

25) If an SCP file says never to do something, it is not because we want to control your mind. --Yes it is.--

25.1) No, it's not, and Dr. Bright may not edit this document.

26) [[[SCP-437]]] is not to be handed out as weaponry to unsuspecting new researchers.

27) [DATA REDACTED ON O5 REQUEST]. Not even for recreational use.

28) Not allowed to send Nigerian-esque spam email to the Church of the Broken God.

29) Not allowed to lead a Mobile Task Force --against the UIU-- --under any circumstances.-- --without inviting Dr. Clef-- at all. In fact, just stay 500 feet away from any Mobile Task Force at all times.

31.1)Especially not with D-class in garb.

32) [[[SCP-963]]] is not a joy buzzer.

32) If a mind-controlling SCP is discovered, it is to be turned over to the proper authorities. It is not to be used to advance himself or others higher in the Foundation. --Kondraki--

32.1) Taking said mind controlling SCP to a strip club or Vegas shall be right out.

33) Dr. Bright is NOT: A superhero of any sort, Head of Public Relations, in charge of Orientation for new staff, a doctor of psychology, --a member of Site Command--, made out of bacon, in possession of a IQ over 300, Head of SCP Review, or a member of Maintenance Staff. (Sorry boys, Dr. Bright IS a member of Site Command. It's usually best not to ask why.)

34) No longer allowed to make up jodies for morning calisthenics.

41) Dr. Clef and Dr. Bright are not allowed to interact without the presence of a responsible administrator. 

41.1) Dr. Kondraki does not count as a responsible administrator.

42) Chainsaws are not the solution to every question.

44.1) Not even if Dr. Rights asks nicely.

58) [[[SCP-288]]] is not an appropriate Valentine's Day gift.

59) [[[SCP-082]]] is not to be given song requests, especially not "Like A Virgin".

60) "Accidentally" spilling green gelatin on a dead body in the presence of the O5 was funny exactly once, and the smell of excrement exuding from O5-2's khakis spoiled the moment.

62) Dr. Bright is no longer allowed to utter the phrase "More than 1,000 babies" in the presence of any SCP personnel.

63) Nothing in the Foundation is rated 'Over 9000.'

64) Stop posting classified information on 4-chan.

66) No using [[[SCP-705]]] for personal gain.

66.1) Or to plant monitoring equipment.

66.2) And absolutely no giving them tons of extra Play-Doh 'just to see what they can make.' That Mecha was damned annoying!

66.3) No telling them that Dr. Rights' underwear drawer is a 'strategic ambush position'. --As a matter of fact, no telling ANYTHING that Dr. Rights' delicates drawer is a strategic ambush position.--  Nothing in there has any strategic value, Bright.

66.4) Dr. Bright is not to explain his definition of strategic value, ever again. Anyone found asking will be terminated. 

67) If it involves doing something wrong, it isn't right.

68) If Dr. Bright has to ask, it's above his clearance level.

68.1) If it's above Bright's security clearance... run.

69) Dr. Bright is not allowed to declare war on any country, thing or person.

70)  --A stripper a day keeps the doctor away.-- Dr. Bright is not allowed to contribute to this list. --Besides, ██% of Foundation staff have their Ph.D. It'd take more than one stripper to keep them away.--

70.1) Strike that last sentence. Dr. Bright, I don't know where you found a 300 lb, midget stripper with three teeth and severely disfiguring [DATA EXPUNGED], but please put --her-- --him-- it back.

72) Foundation credit cards or expense accounts are not to be used to purchase pornography.

74.2) Dr. Bright may not play Dungeons and Dragons with --humanoid-- any SCP objects.

76) Dr. Bright is not allowed to go to fan conventions.

76.1) Let alone use them as recruitment drives.

76.2) Especially not at Furry Conventions.

79) When writing a report, more detail is expected than "Object class: Keter. Special Containment Procedures: [DATA EXPUNGED]. Description: [DATA EXPUNGED]."

79.1) And inventing new security clearances just so nobody can see what you've written is also considered poor form.

80) Showing Monty Python episodes to [[[SCP-239]]] was not a wise decision. Please never try this with any other reality warping SCP.

81) "For the Emperor" is not an acceptable justification for any decision.

82) "My evil twin did it" is no longer considered a viable excuse.

82.1) Nor is "My good twin did it," considering the implications.

83) Yes, forum trolls are annoying. No, they don't automatically become D-class personnel.

85) Dr. Bright is not allowed to send e-mails with memetic hazards attached.

85.1) Not even when replying to spam.

87.1) "Weeding out some of these angsty teens with attitude problems," however, is.

90.1) Not allowed to play dodgeball with [[[SCP-2558-J]]].

91) Any proposal which includes the phrase 'Metric Fuck Load' is straight out denied.

92) --Instances of SCP-2558-J-Ex are not to be spooked when being held by members of O5.-- No instances of [[[SCP-2558-J]]] should be anywhere near an O5, let alone SCP-2558-J-Ex.

94) The Foundation motto is "Secure, Contain, Protect", not any of the following:

* "Stab Carrion Powerfully"
* "Suck Cock and Penis"

* "Will it blend?"
* "Commies love us!"
* "Snap Crackle and Pop"

95) Dr. Bright is no longer allowed to play "Hippocratic Oath Chicken" with the medical staff.

96) A full minute of stunned silence means "My God what did you do?" not "Please continue."

97) Pranks placed into new staff's desks are not funny because they "liquefied in record time."

98) Attempts to use Foundation radio telescopes to contact omniscient and omnipotent extraterrestrial entities will result in a bill for any damage to local space-time, including the cost of demoting objects to dwarf planet status.

99) Despite his title, Dr. Bright is not allowed to prescribe any medication to other staff members.

99.1) In light of "The Enema Incident", Dr. Bright is not allowed to prescribe homeopathic or alternative therapies either. 

100) Not allowed to use this list as a checklist.

101) Dr. Bright is no longer allowed to offer the solution of "Use more guns" to any problem.

101.1) Just because it works in an [[[Recovered Papers Of Icarus Smith |alternate universe]]] does not mean it works in ours.

102) Despite what he may say and any evidence, no matter how plausible, the SCP Foundation has never and will never be associated with Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and regardless of what Dr. Bright may say, he is not, and I quote, "A real life wizarding tutor." And we ask him to stop showing us his "wand".


102.1) Nor is he a Vampire. That was body glitter and bad acting.

102.2) And despite what the computer file on him may say, he is not Muad'dib. The spice can flow just fine without him.

103) The "Tamlin House School of Witchcraft and Wizardry" is just a plain bad idea.

104) Yes, empirical evidence is the foundation of science. Yes, blind faith is the death of reason. No, this does not logically imply that Dr. Rights is ethically obligated to demonstrate the existence of her breasts under laboratory conditions.

105) [[[SCP-173]]] and --[[[SCP-974]]]-- are not allowed in the same room. 

105.1) Dr. Bright is no longer allowed near any photocopier.

106.1) If Dr. Bright is found deliberately getting high to get out of paperwork, he is to be placed in a Type 4 cell and hosed down with cold water from a pressurised hose for no less than 5 minutes. Maybe this will teach you that drugs are bad m'kay?

107) Cthulhu and R'lyeh are not valid reasons to send Pandora's Box out and into the Pacific Ocean in order to capture them. Furthermore, these are not even SCPs, and do know I will find the person who decided to enter a database file for them.

108) Dr. Bright is not allowed to upload visual memetic kill agents to --4chan-- --7chan-- any imageboard.

108.1) Well, okay, maybe to 4chan. It'd be doing the gene pool a service.

109) Dr. Bright cannot change the standard issue D-Class uniform to black pants with a red polo shirt.



111) No matter how many times he may claim it, no matter how many uniforms we may confiscate, and no matter how many oriental people we have to terminate as his host, Dr. Bright is not a ninja, nor has he ever been.

111.1) No. Not even if he uses [[[SCP-281]]] to do it.

112) There are no security codes for:
* Zombie conga line

* Man disguised as a palm tree
* Man with porn 'stache
* Kung fu rasta
* Puppy-eating monks
* Justifiable homicide of all you dumb ass mother humpers.
* --Bright Family Reunion-- (Code Brown. Find a place to hide, and make sure you leave an offering of booze outside your door.)
*  Dr. Kondraki beach party.

113) Just because Bright is //a// doctor does not mean that he is //the// Doctor, no matter how many British men he possesses.

113.1) No, [[[SCP-963]]] is not proof against this.

113.2) Nor is any structure that results from placing [[[SCP-184]]] inside of a police call box.

113.3) Tying up female members of the staff and calling them "companions" is right out.



115) While humour can be an effective way to improve staff morale, it is //highly// inappropriate to make "Your mum" jokes in the vicinity of [[[SCP-597]]].

116) Dr. Bright may not classify any researcher, including himself, as a memetic hazard.

117) Dr. Bright is no longer allowed to accept or use the following as payment for bets:
* Your soul
* Anyone else's soul
* Virgin's blood
* Reproductive organs
* SCPs
* Memories (real or imagined)
* --Pieces of your past-- I have no idea how that worked with Clef, but apparently he can do it.
* The island of Manhattan
* Beads
* Firstborn children
* Second-born children
* Red-headed stepchildren
* Gold spun from straw
* A child's laughter
* A child's tears
* Virginity

* Aural Virginity
* --Nasal Virginity-- (I do NOT want to know!)
* Ponies
* Anyone's grandmother
* Anyone's sister

118) No matter how many times he photoshops himself into a picture of [[[SCP-682]]], and no matter how many Australians he possesses, Bright is not, and never was, the "Crocodile Hunter".

118.1) Nor does every SCP/D-Class "really hate it when you jam your thumb up their bum.

118.2) And he is not allowed to do that "Right naow!"



119) As funny as Incident 387/682-██ was, Dr. Bright is not allowed unsupervised access to [[[SCP-387]]]. Agents are still trying to figure out how an animate model of 682 was so invulnerable, despite being made of just plastic blocks.




124) Dr. Bright is not allowed to tell new researchers experimenting on [[[SCP-168]]] to divide by zero, find the square root of negative one or find the last digit of pi using the SCP. Dr. ██████ is still comatose, and 168 itself is quite displeased with the event.

125) Dr. Bright is not allowed to use examples from Star Trek when administering Turing tests to artificial intelligences of any sort.  In fact, Rule 20 applies to AIs as well. Computer hardware does not grow on trees, dammit!


126) Dr. Bright is not allowed to plant [[[SCP-2383-J]]] into science labs. We're still picking up complaints from the office of Stephen Hawking.

127.1) Nor is he allowed to set himself up as a god to them.

127.2) Testing between [[[SCP-786]]] and SCP-587 is also banned. "David and Goliath" scenarios are just as harmful to its inhabitants as the Godzilla incident.

127.3) Dr. Bright  is not allowed to use [[[SCP-786]]] to simulate "Dwarf Fortress".

128) Dr. Bright is not allowed to play [[[SCP-682]]] any Uwe Boll movies.

129) Dr. Bright is not allowed to tell new researchers that typing @@"01100110011011110111001001101101011000010111010000 100000011000110011101001011100 0010000000101111010100010010111101011000"@@ in a text file and renaming it "079.exe" will give them complete control over [[[SCP-079]]].

130) Dr. Bright is not allowed to use [[[SCP-559]]] with one candle in order to [DATA EXPUNGED] attempted breast-feeding incident.

130.1) In fact, let's just amend that to 'Dr. Bright is not allowed to be breast-fed. Period'.


132) Dr. Bright is not allowed to claim [[[SCP-014-J]]] has "Breached Containment" and then leave a dining fork in the hallway.

138.2) Dr. Bright is not permitted to use [[[SCP-294]]] to create orgasms of any kind, memetic, sentient or otherwise.

138.3) Given the results of requesting a cup of "Dear God No", Dr.Bright is no longer allowed to use [[[SCP-294]]] directly or outside of approved testing.

138.4) Given that he asked another staff member to request a "Cup of Explodium" from SCP-294 to "see what would happen", Dr Bright is not allowed to ask other staff members to access SCPs for him, no matter how instructive, funny or helpful the results would be. The only exception to this is SCP-963.

Not even if you try to throw in 682 trying to disguise it as a termination attempt.

145) Dr. Bright is not allowed to get on the PA system at site 19 and announce that he just won The Game.

150.1) Strike that, Dr. Bright is not allowed to create pornography of anything, ever.

150.2) Contrary to what he may tell you "I'm the physical manifestation of Rule 34" is not a sufficient reason for creating pornography of any kind. Including pornography of pornography. We know about the 2girls1cup pornography incident --and it was glorious--. No it was not.

151) We don't care HOW may O5's agree to it and how many precedents there are, Dr Bright is not allowed a pet SCP.


153) Dr. Bright is not allowed to combine a cadaver infected with [[[SCP-008]]] with [[[SCP-217]]].

157.2) --Nor is he allowed to request [[[SCP-909]]] to write down "O5-██ has forbidden Dr. Bright from requesting [[[SCP-909]]] to wri-- //Let's just keep Dr. Bright away from [[[SCP-909]]]// - O5-██
