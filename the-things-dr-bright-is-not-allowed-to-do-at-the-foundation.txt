title:The Things Dr Bright Is Not Allowed To Do At The Foundation
**Revised List**

1) Dr Bright is not allowed to feed anything with peanut butter to Kain.

2) Telling new researchers that you can tame [[[SCP-682 |682]]] with a rolled up newspaper and a tummy rub is right out.

3) No longer allowed to challenge Abel to unwinnable games like tic-tac-toe. It was three weeks before Abel conceded a draw.

4) [[[SCP-018]]] is not to be taunted!

5) [[[SCP-808 |808]]]/[[[SCP-105 |105]]] is never going to happen. Let it go.

6) Giving [[[SCP-113 |113]]] to Diogenes is just plain pointless.

7) Attempting to disprove [[[SCP-343 |343]]], //to// 343, is a horrible idea. Agents are still studying the resulting paperweight; supposedly so heavy that 343 should not be able to lift it.

8) There is no viable situation in which [[[SCP-816]]] should be used for "The Time Warp."

9) Dr. Bright is not king of anywhere.

10) [[[SCP-963]]] is not to be used for recreational or procreational purposes.

11) [[[SCP-963]]] is not to be used to instigate Harpy "Cockfights" no matter how high the betting stakes.

12) Although it is entirely possible to use SCPs currently under control of the Foundation to create tentacle monsters, no.

12.5) Not even if Dr. Palmer asks nicely.

13) There is no market for SCP brand pornography. 

13.5) No, not even in Germany.

14) You cannot give the command "Strip" with  [[[SCP-061]]]

15) Should not replace the buckshot in Dr Clef's shotgun shells with any of the following: birdseed, confetti, cake sprinkles, sawdust, or sexual lubricant.

16) Should not replace Dr. Rights' lamp with a "novelty" lamp shaped like a marital aid.

17) The Better Business Bureau is not the correct agency for dealing with containment failures from horrible eldritch artifacts sold by Marshall, Carter, and Dark.

18) Lacing [[[SCP-408]]]'s feed with LSD.

18.5) No, especially if Dr. Kondraki is around.

19) Come in contact with foreskins or foreskin-related paraphernalia.

19.5) Yes, this means he has to be circumcised. Every time.

--20) Dr.Bright must never come in contact with anyone under the age of 18.-- --Let him contact them. It's the only way they'll learn.-- Just because it is a learning experience, does not mean anyone needs to come in contact with Bright's foreskin.

21) It is inadvisable to leave Dr. Bright without guards near a fire alarm for more than six seconds. Results can be catastrophic (see Containment Breach Report #████ for an example).

22) Any requests by Dr. Bright to utilize [[[SCP-212]]] for enhancement are to be denied, due to several requests being submitted with the research goal stated as "to stick my privets in it and hope for the best."

22.5) Dr. Bright is now approved to do testing on SCP-212 with [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privet Ligustrum vulgare]. Do not be fooled, his cries of disappointment are actually squeals of joy.

23) Victims of [[[SCP-217]]] are not toys.

24) Never, ever let Dr. Bright consume any amount of [[[SCP-496]]]. Although giving him ordinary weed (crabgrass, corn smut etc) and telling him that it's SCP-496 is okay.

25) Don't let Dr. Bright get a sample of SCP-379. Let my laptop be the last victim.

26) Not allowed to go off my medication.

27) Not allowed to pretend I have any medication to be on.

28) May not use any form of the word 'accident' as an excuse.

29) Violate the dress code, even on 'casual' Fridays.

30) If an SCP file says never to do something, it is not because we want to control your mind. --Yes it is.--
