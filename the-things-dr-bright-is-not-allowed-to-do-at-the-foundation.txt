[[/>]]


**Revised List**

1) Dr. Bright is not allowed to feed anything with peanut butter to Kain.

2) Telling new researchers that you can tame [[[SCP-682 |682]]] with a rolled up newspaper and a tummy rub is right out.

3) No longer allowed to challenge Able to unwinnable games like tic-tac-toe. It was three weeks before Able conceded a draw.

4) [[[SCP-018]]] is not to be taunted!

5) Giving [[[SCP-113 |113]]] to Diogenes is just plain pointless.

6) Attempting to disprove [[[SCP-343 |343]]], //to// 343, is a horrible idea. Agents are still studying the resulting paperweight, supposedly so heavy that 343 should not be able to lift it.

7) While it is true that "No one expects the Brightish Inquisition!", that is only because there is no such thing.

8) Dr. Bright is not king of anywhere.

8.1) Neither is he queen of anywhere. Additionally, Dr. Bright is not allowed access to SCP-113.

9) [[[SCP-399]]] is not a "Green Lantern Ring".

9.1) --Nor is it a Red, Orange, Yellow, Blue, Indigo, Violet, Black or White Lantern Ring-- SCP-399 is not //any// type of Power Ring. //(We don't care how many colors you paint the bloody thing, Bright.)//

10) [[[SCP-963]]] is not to be used for recreational or procreational purposes.

11) [[[SCP-963]]] is not to be used to instigate Harpy "Cockfights" no matter how high the betting stakes.

12) Although it is entirely possible to use SCPs currently under control of the Foundation to create tentacle monsters, no.

12.1) Not even if Dr. Palmer asks nicely.

13) There is no market for SCP brand pornography. 

13.1) No, not even in Germany.

13.2) It probably would generate a great deal of revenue if sold in Japan but still, 682 on Iris, Jesus Christ man.

14) You cannot give the command "Strip" with  [[[SCP-061]]].

15) Should not replace the buckshot in Dr. Clef's shotgun shells with any of the following: birdseed, confetti, cake sprinkles, sawdust, or sexual lubricant.

16) Should not replace Dr. Rights' lamp with a "novelty" lamp shaped like a marital aid.

17) The Better Business Bureau is not the correct agency for dealing with containment failures from horrible eldritch artifacts sold by Marshall, Carter, and Dark.

18) Lacing [[[SCP-408]]]'s feed with LSD.

18.1) No, especially if Dr. Kondraki is around.

19) Come in contact with foreskins or foreskin-related paraphernalia.

19.1) Yes, this means he has to be circumcised. Every time.

20) Dr. Bright must never come in contact with anyone under the age of 18. --Let him contact them. It's the only way they'll learn.-- Just because it is a learning experience, does not mean anyone needs to come in contact with Bright.

21) It is inadvisable to leave Dr. Bright without guards near a fire alarm for more than six seconds. Results can be catastrophic (see Containment Breach Report #████ for an example).

22) Any requests by Dr. Bright to utilize [[[SCP-212]]] for enhancement are to be denied, due to several requests being submitted with the research goal stated as "to stick my privets in it and hope for the best."

22.1) Dr. Bright is now approved to do testing on SCP-212 with //[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privet Ligustrum vulgare]//. Do not be fooled, his cries of disappointment are actually squeals of joy.

23) Victims of [[[SCP-217]]] are not toys.

24) Dr. Bright is not allowed to bargain with personnel for their "souls" if they are unaware of [[[SCP-158]]].

25) Don't let Dr. Bright get a sample of [[[SCP-379]]]. Let my laptop be the last victim.

26) Not allowed to go off my medication.

27) Not allowed to pretend I have any medication to be on.

28) May not use any form of the word 'accident' as an excuse.

29) Violate the dress code, even on 'casual' Fridays.

29.1) No matter how many times you say please, Dr. Bright, we won't put any of the hats you've been asking about into the dress code.

29.2) Nor are you allowed to create and wear hats made using or out of various anomalous objects. We understand that your [[[SCP-894]]] top hat collection has some tactical value, but that is not a valid reason to wear them in the presence of other researchers.

30) If an SCP file says never to do something, it is not because we want to control your mind. --Yes it is.--

30.1) No, it's not, and Dr. Bright may not edit this document.

31) [[[SCP-437]]] is not to be handed out as weaponry to unsuspecting new researchers.

32) Not to misinform Dr. Laugher as to [[[SCP-260]]]'s location.  Oh, wait, that's no longer applicable.  Not to misinform ANYONE of SCP-260's location.

33) [DATA REDACTED ON O5 REQUEST]. Not even for recreational use.

34) Not allowed to send Nigerian-esque spam email to the Church of the Broken God.

35) Not allowed to lead a Mobile Task Force --against the UIU-- --under any circumstances.-- --without inviting Dr. Clef-- at all. In fact, just stay 500 feet away from any Mobile Task Force at all times.

36) Not allowed to end reports with lyrics from "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air".

36.1) But is allowed to end with lyrics from the Safety Dance.

36.2) The interpretive dance routine, however, is forbidden --until he gets lessons-- for the foreseeable future.

37) [[[SCP-963]]] is not a joy buzzer.

38) If a mind controlling SCP is discovered, it is to be turned over to the proper authorities. It is not to be used to advance himself or others higher in the Foundation. --Kondraki--

38.1) Taking said mind controlling SCP to a strip club or Vegas shall be right out.

39) Dr. Bright is NOT: A superhero of any sort, Head of Public Relations, in charge of Orientation for new staff, a doctor of psychology, --a member of Site Command--, made out of bacon, in possession of a IQ over 300, Head of SCP Review, or a member of Maintenance Staff. (Sorry boys, Dr. Bright IS a member of Site Command. It's usually best not to ask why.)

40) No longer allowed to make up jodies for morning calisthenics.

40.1) Yes, this includes The Mickey Mouse Club song.

41) Dr. Bright is not allowed to apply [[[SCP-963]]] to any major political figures. --Again.--

42) Dr. Bright is not from an alternate timeline.

42.1) Dr. Bright cannot override orders to "preserve the timeline".

43) Dr. Bright cannot plan activities with Dr. Iceberg. 

43.1) Dr. Iceberg is not allowed to make edits to files while drunk.

44) Dr. Bright is not allowed to challenge anyone to a duel, and then give them [[[SCP-572]]].

45) Dr. Bright is not allowed near [[[SCP-5555-J]]] in any way or any excuse. Remember what the miniature version did to Dr. L██████.

46) Dr. Bright no longer allowed use of thimbles in any aspect.

47) Dr. Clef and Dr. Bright are not allowed to interact without the presence of a responsible administrator. 

47.1) Dr. Kondraki does not count as a responsible administrator.

48) Chainsaws are not the solution to every question.

48.1) Nor is 'More Chainsaws'.

48.2) Or "Chainsaw cannons"

49) SCP speed dating never happened. Any one who claims to remember such an event should report to Site Command for administration of Class A amnesiac. 

50) Dr. Bright is not allowed to use any SCP to alter or affect the outcomes of any reality based television shows, including but not limited to Survivor, Big Brother, Hell's Kitchen, American Idol, or any dating show on VH1.

50.1) Not even if Dr. Rights asks nicely.

51) Not allowed to give [[[SCP-454]]] to Iceberg. We need that man doing paperwork!

52) [REDACTED], [REDACTED] hard.

53) Dr. Bright is not allowed to take [[[SCP-278]]] out on joyrides.

55) Dr. Bright is not allowed to "review Dr. Rights' office security tapes".

55.1) Neither is he allowed to have a live feed of Dr. Rights' office in his computer. --Too late.--

57) No hitting on girls at the dyke bar, no matter the sex of the body he may be in.

58) [[[SCP-288]]] is not an appropriate Valentine's Day gift.

59) [[[SCP-082]]] is not to be given song requests, especially not "Like A Virgin".

60) "Accidentally" spilling green gelatin on a dead body in the presence of the O5 was funny exactly once, and the smell of excrement exuding from O5-2's khakis spoiled the moment.

61) Leave supposedly used condoms floating in [[[SCP-827]]].

62) Dr. Bright is no longer allowed to utter the phrase "More than 1,000 babies" in the presence of any SCP personnel.

63) Nothing in the Foundation is rated 'Over 9000.'

64) Stop posting classified information on 4-chan.

64.1) Attempting to get around this restriction by using [[[SCP-062]]] is rather explicitly frowned upon.

65) Call Site-17 security staff, screaming that [[[SCP-110]]] has escaped.

66) No using [[[SCP-705]]] for personal gain.

66.1) Or to plant monitoring equipment.

66.2) And absolutely no giving them tons of extra playdough 'just to see what they can make.' That Mecha was damned annoying!

66.3) No telling them that Dr. Rights' underwear drawer is a 'strategic ambush position'. --As a matter of fact, no telling ANYTHING that Dr. Rights' delicates drawer is a strategic ambush position.--  Nothing in there has any strategic value, Bright.

66.4) Dr. Bright is not to explain his definition of strategic value, ever again. Anyone found asking will be terminated. 

67) If it involves doing something wrong, it isn't right.

68) If Dr. Bright has to ask, it's above his clearance level.

69) Dr. Bright is not allowed to declare war on any country, thing or person.

70)  --A stripper a day keeps the doctor away.-- Dr. Bright is not allowed to contribute to this list. --Besides, ██% of Foundation staff have their Ph.D. It'd take more than one stripper to keep them away.--

70.1) Strike that last sentence. Dr. Bright, I don't know where you found a 300 lb, midget stripper with three teeth and severely disfiguring [DATA EXPUNGED], but please put --her-- --him-- it back.

71) There are no authorized experiments attempting to give Dr. Bright 105's ability. He would only use it for evil.

71.1) Even if it would save the Foundation thousands of dollars a year. See 72.

72) Foundation credit cards or expense accounts are not to be used to purchase pornography. 

73) Dr. Bright is not a "marital aid" and cannot refer to himself as such. Especially on official documents.

74) Dr. Bright is not the Lord of Rodly Might.

74.1) And is hereby banned from playing Dungeons and Dragons making use of SCPs to 'simulate the real danger.'

75) 2girls1cup is not an appropriate screen saver to be applied to all work stations.

76) Dr. Bright is not allowed to go to fan conventions.

76.1) Let alone use them as recruitment drives.

76.2) Especially not at Furry Conventions.

77) Dr. Bright is not allowed to tell Dr. Dumount that he is a humanoid SCP.

77.1) Nor is he allowed to convince Dr. Dumount to repeatedly attempt to terminate him.

78.) Dr. Bright is not allowed to dare anyone to kiss [[[SCP-562]]].

79) When writing a report, more detail is expected than "Object class: Keter. Special Containment Procedures: [DATA EXPUNGED]. Description: [DATA EXPUNGED]."

79.1) And inventing new security clearances just so nobody can see what you've written is also considered poor form.

80) Showing Monty Python episodes to [[[SCP-239]]] was not a wise decision. Please never try this with any other reality warping SCP.

81) "For the Emperor" is not an acceptable justification for any decision.

82) "My evil twin did it" is no longer considered a viable excuse.

82.1) Nor is "My good twin did it," considering the implications.

83) Yes, forum trolls are annoying. No, they don't automatically become D-class personnel.

84) Not allowed to lace 'orgasm muffins' with Ex-lax. Again.

85) Dr. Bright is not allowed to send e-mails with memetic hazards attached.

85.1) Not even when replying to spam.

86) [[[SCP-310]]] is not to be used on birthday cakes.

87) The "Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate Destiny" is not grounds to pit more than //fifteen// combative SCPs, including [[[SCP-682]]] and Able, against each other.

87.1) "Weeding out some of these angsty teens with attitude problems," however, is.

88) Dr. Bright is not allowed to administer 'Free Hugs', nor an act called 'Surprise █████████'. Dr. Deans is still in therapy.

89) Asking a person to put a label over [[[SCP-616 |616]]] that reads "New Jersey" is a 682-duty offence.

90) Not allowed to kick [[[SCP-2558-J]]].

90.1) Not allowed to play dodgeball with [[[SCP-2558-J]]].

91) Any proposal which includes the phrase 'Metric Fuck Load' is straight out denied.

91.1) This goes triple if the proposal includes [[[SCP-705]]].

92) --Instances of SCP-2558-J-Ex are not to be spooked when being held by members of O5.-- No instances of [[[SCP-2558-J]]] should be anywhere near an O5, let alone SCP-2558-J-Ex.

93) Covering yourself with a sheet, hiding behind the curtain in the Researcher Lounge at night, and jumping out yelling “OOGA BOOGA BOOGA” is never appropriate. Nor is laughing hysterically for over an hour at the poor agent you scared, who threw his chair through the window before running out and calling a lockdown. We get enough of this shit at our jobs. --Are you kidding? That was hilarious.-- No it was not.

94) The Foundation motto is "Secure, Contain, Protect", not any of the following:

* "Stab Carrion Powerfully"
* "Suck Cock and Penis"
* "Let's use it on 682!"
* "That's it, you're on Keter."
* "Can we put it in [[[SCP-914 |914]]]?"
* "Blood makes the grass grow, kill, kill, kill!"
* "Rights panties!"
* "Fuck trees, I climb clouds motherfucker!"
* "Someone is getting stabbed."
* "Let's just stick our dicks in it and hope for the best."
* "Whose hand is that?"
* "If all else fails, poop on it."
* "If all else fails, there's always the sun."
* "Show it your tits, Rights!"
* "We need bigger kittens."
* "Society of Creepy Perverts."
* "Fuck Death, War, Famine and Pestilence. We've got Clef, Gears, Kondraki and Bright."
* "Throw D-Class at it until it stops."
* "447 and dead bodies, two great tastes that taste great together."
* "The FBI are a bunch of pansies."
* "Who wants to see what I can make the president do in public?"
* "For the Horde!"
* "Science for the Science God!"
* "Make sure to wipe your feet on 2558!"
* "When in doubt, feed it to 682."
* "Slapstick, Clowns and Puns"
* "Drop the blanket now!"
* "Seduction, Coitus, and Pregnancy"
* "We always need more Dakka!"
* "Still Alive, and Found the Cake"
* "Don't Worry, O5 won't ever figure it out!"
* "Will it blend?"
* "Commies love us!"

95) Dr. Bright is no longer allowed to play "Hippocratic Oath Chicken" with the medical staff.

96) A full minute of stunned silence means "My God what did you do?" not "Please continue."

97) Pranks placed into new staff's desks are not funny because they "Liquefied in record time."

98) Attempts to use Foundation radio telescopes to contact omniscient and omnipotent extraterrestrial entities will result in a bill for any damage to local space-time, including the cost of demoting objects to dwarf planet status.

99) Despite his title, Dr. Bright is not allowed to prescribe any medication to other staff members.

99.1) In light of "The Enema Incident", Dr. Bright is not allowed to prescribe homeopathic or alternative therapies either. Please report all such incidents to O5 command.

100) Not allowed to use this list as a check list.

101) Dr. Bright is no longer allowed to offer the solution of "Use more guns" to any problem.

101.1) Just because it works in an [[[Recovered Papers Of Icarus Smith |alternate universe]]] does not mean it works in ours.

102) Despite what he may say and any evidence, no matter how plausible, the SCP Foundation has never and will never be associated with Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and regardless of what Dr. Bright may say, he is not, and I quote, "A real life wizarding tutor." And we ask him to stop showing us his "wand".


102.1) Nor is he a Vampire. That was body glitter and bad acting.

102.2) And despite what the computer file on him may say, he is not Muad'dib. The spice can flow just fine without him.

103) The "Tamlin House School of Witchcraft and Wizardry" is just a plain bad idea.

104) Yes, empirical evidence is the foundation of science. Yes, blind faith is the death of reason. No, this does not logically imply that Dr. Rights is ethically obligated to demonstrate the existence of her breasts under laboratory conditions.

105) [[[SCP-173]]] and --[[[SCP-974]]]-- are not allowed in the same room. 

105.1) Dr. Bright is no longer allowed near any photocopier.

106) If Dr. Bright is ever found under the influence of any recreational substance, he must immediately be contained under level 15 containment. If you want to know why, please refer to the security tapes for ██/██/████ between the hours of ██:██ am and ██:██ pm.

106.1) If Dr. Bright is found deliberately getting high to get out of paperwork, he is to be placed in a Type 4 cell and hosed down with cold water from a pressurised hose for no less than 5 minutes. Maybe this will teach you that drugs are bad m'kay?

107) Cthulhu and R'lyeh are not valid reasons to send Pandora's Box out and into the Pacific Ocean in order to capture them. Furthermore, these are not even SCPs, and do know I will find the person who decided to enter a database file for them.

108) Dr. Bright is not allowed to upload visual memetic kill agents to --4chan-- --7chan-- any imageboard.

108.1) Well, okay, maybe to 4chan. It'd be doing the gene pool a service.

109) Dr. Bright cannot change the standard issue D-Class uniform to black pants with a red polo shirt.

110) Spending an hour --harassing-- observing Dr. Chapter does not make Dr. Bright an accredited hypnotherapist.

111) No matter how many times he may claim it, no matter how many uniforms we may confiscate, and no matter how many oriental people we have to terminate as his host, Dr. Bright is not a ninja, nor has he ever been.

111.1) No. Not even if he uses [[[SCP-281]]] to do it.

112) There are no security codes for:
* Zombie conga line
* Badass hat
* Vampire can-can
* Disco corpse
* --Intense homoeroticism-- (I do not want to know...)
* Hoo mama
* --Necrophilia-- (I do NOT want to know!)
* Extreme crotch violence
* Man disguised as a palm tree
* Man with porn 'stache
* Kung fu rasta
* Puppy-eating monks
* Justifiable homicide of all you dumb ass mother humpers.
* --Bright Family Reunion-- (Code Brown. Find a place to hide, and make sure you leave an offering of booze outside your door.)
*  Dr. Kondraki beach party.

113) Just because Bright is //a// doctor does not mean that he is //the// Doctor, no matter how many British men he possesses.

113.1) No, [[[SCP-963]]] is not proof against this.

113.2) Nor is any structure that results from placing [[[SCP-184]]] inside of a police call box.

113.3) Tying up female members of the staff and calling them "companions" is right out.

114) [[[SCP-610]]] does not need to "Spawn more overlords."

114.1) Nor is it "A monument to all our sins."

114.2) Dr. Bright is not allowed to keep any SCP-610 infested entities as pets

114.3) Dr. Bright is not allowed to "feed" SCP-610.

115) While humour can be an effective way to improve staff morale, it is //highly// inappropriate to make "Your mum" jokes in the vicinity of [[[SCP-597]]].

116) Dr. Bright may not classify any researcher, including himself, as a memetic hazard.

117) Dr. Bright is no longer allowed to accept or use the following as payment for bets:
* Your soul
* Anyone else's soul
* Virgin's blood
* Reproductive organs
* SCPs
* Memories (real or imagined)
* --Pieces of your past-- I have no idea how that worked with Clef, but apparently he can do it.
* The island of Manhattan
* Beads
* Firstborn children
* Second-born children
* Red-headed stepchildren
* Gold spun from straw
* A child's laughter
* A child's tears
* Virginity
* Anal virginity
* Aural Virginity
* --Nasal Virginity-- (I do NOT want to know!)
* Ponies
* Anyone's grandmother
* Anyone's sister

118) No matter how many times he photoshops himself into a picture of [[[SCP-682]]], and no matter how many Australians he possesses, Bright is not, and never was, the "Crocodile Hunter".

118.1) Nor does every SCP/D-Class "really hate it when you jam your thumb up their bum.

118.2) And he is not allowed to do that "Right naow!"

118.3) Claiming to survive the detonation of an [[[scp-2558-j|SCP-2558-J-Ex]]] does not make him a lion tamer, either.

119) As funny as Incident 387/682-██ was, Dr. Bright is not allowed unsupervised access to [[[SCP-387]]]. Agents are still trying to figure out how an animate model of 682 was so invulnerable, despite being made of just plastic blocks.

120) Not allowed to feed [[[SCP-184]]] to SCP-682.

121) Dr. Bright is not allowed to make the existence of "The Beatles™: Rock Band™" known to [[[SCP-043]]], following Incident 043-C. Dr. ██████, who devised the method of feeding SCP-043 an amnesiac, is still in a coma.

122) Dr. Bright is not allowed to goad other personnel into putting semen into [[[SCP-107]]].

122.1) Nor is he allowed to cajole personnel into putting [[[SCP-447]]]-2 into [[[SCP-107]]].

122.2) Not even as the centerpiece of a vegetable platter for a Super Bowl party.

122.3) Nor is he allowed to put in any amount of pure capsaicin.

123) No matter how much it might 'improve morale' among Foundation personnel, Dr. Bright is not allowed to experiment with [[[SCP-335]]] discs 1-12 and [[[SCP-713]]] in order to copy/paste Sasha Grey.

123.1) Nor is he allowed to paste images of 173 in offices, hallways, closets, or bathroom stalls when he doesn't get his way.

124) Dr. Bright is not allowed to tell new researchers experimenting on [[[SCP-168]]] to divide by zero, find the square root of negative one or find the last digit of pi using the SCP. Dr. ██████ is still comatose, and 168 itself is quite displeased with the event.

125) Dr. Bright is not allowed to use examples from Star Trek when administering Turing tests to artificial intelligences of any sort.  In fact, Rule 20 applies to AIs as well. Computer hardware does not grow on trees, dammit!

125.1) Using [[[SCP-038]]] to disprove the above is right out.

126) Dr. Bright is not allowed to plant [[[SCP-2383-J]]] into science labs. We're still picking up complaints from the office of Stephen Hawking.

126.1) No, not even for the good of "SCIENCE"

126.2) Or even as "Science for the Science God". Dr. Bright is also not allowed to refer to himself as such either.

127) Dr. Bright is not allowed to use [[[SCP-587]]] to re-enact the locker scene from //Men In Black//, nor play Godzilla with its inhabitants.

127.1) Nor is he allowed to set himself up as a god to them.

127.2) Testing between [[[SCP-786]]] and SCP-587 is also banned. "David and Goliath" scenarios are just as harmful to its inhabitants as the Godzilla incident.

128) Dr. Bright is not allowed to play [[[SCP-682]]] any Uwe Boll movies.

128.1) The same goes for //The Room//.

128.2) And //Troll 2//.

128.3) --And //Manos: The Hands of Fate//-- Dr. Bright is not allowed to show [[[SCP-682]]] ANY bad movies.

129) Dr. Bright is not allowed to tell new researchers that typing @@"01100110011011110111001001101101011000010111010000 100000011000110011101001011100 0010000000101111010100010010111101011000"@@ in a text file and renaming it "079.exe" will give them complete control over [[[SCP-079]]].

130) Dr. Bright is not allowed to use [[[SCP-559]]] with one candle in order to [DATA EXPUNGED] attempted breast-feeding incident.

130.1) In fact, let's just amend that to 'Dr. Bright is not allowed to be breast-fed. Period'.

131) Dr. Bright is not allowed to use [[[SCP-826]]] on Pornography.

132) Dr. Bright is not allowed to claim [[[SCP-014-J]]] has "Breached Containment" and then leave a dining fork in the hallway.

137) Dr. Bright may not attempt to have other Foundation employees who he dislikes terminated by accusing them of being another one of himself.

138) Dr. Bright may not put "A cup of orgasm" from [[[SCP-294]]] through [[[SCP-914]]] on the Very Fine setting.

138.1) Dr. Bright may not use [[[SCP-294]]] to create a "cup of memetic orgasm" and use it on worldwide television.

138.2) Dr. Bright is not permitted to use [[[SCP-294]]] to create orgasms of any kind, memetic, sentient or otherwise.

138.3) Given the results of requesting a cup of "Dear God No", Dr.Bright is no longer allowed to use [[[SCP-294]]] directly or outside of approved testing.

138.4) Given that he asked another staff member to request a "Cup of Explodium" from SCP-294 to "see what would happen", Dr Bright is not allowed to ask other staff members to access SCPs for him, no matter how instructive, funny or helpful the results would be. The only exception to this is SCP-963.

139) Following the events of Incident 285-██, Dr. Bright is not allowed access to [[[SCP-285]]]. The staff do not want to be "Rick-rolled", Bright. 

140) As of Aug ██, ████, 8PM, Dr. Bright is no longer allowed to explain "The Healing Power of Laughter".

141) Dr. Bright is not allowed to make, accept, or take a rake-off on, bets concerning XK-class End-of-the-World Scenarios.
