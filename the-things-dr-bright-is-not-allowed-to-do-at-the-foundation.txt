title:The Things Dr Bright Is Not Allowed To Do At The Foundation
**Revised List**

1) Dr Bright is not allowed to feed anything with peanut butter to Kain.

2) Telling new researchers that you can tame 682 with a rolled up newspaper and a tummy rub is right out.

3) No longer allowed to challenge Abel to unwinnable games like tic-tac-toe. It was three weeks before Abel conceded a draw.

4) SCP-018 is not to be taunted!

5) 808/105 is never going to happen. Let it go.

6) Giving 113 to Diogenes is just plain pointless.
