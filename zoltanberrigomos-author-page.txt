**Stuff I've written:**


* [[[SCP-3171]]], entitled How The Foundation Came to Operate A Phone Sex Hotline. My version of a common sci-fi trope: what if we meet aliens, but they are so different from us that we have nothing of real value to say to each other? 
* [[[SCP-3192]]], entitled When The Bell Tolls. About one of my deepest fears,  knowing the date and time of my death.
* [[SCP-3159]]], entitled The Trashiest World In The Multiverse. One day, I had a nightmare that I was being chewed alive by a sentient ATM, with people on the street looking on and sadly commiserating about the terribly high number of "flytraps" that pretended to be bank ATMs these days. That motivated this skip.
* [[SCP-3197]], entitled A Trickster God For The Modern Age.  Stories of trickster gods often mix hilarity and cruelty, with the Gods viewing us as ants and being perfectly content to stir up the anthill for the hilarity of watching the little creatures scurry about. 
* Off site, I've been writing [http://archiveofourown.org/works/7742563/chapters/17651086 The Incompetent Witcher], a fanfic set in the Witcher universe.
