**Our Signature Amuse-Bush** -- Hand-crafted by our //pâtissier//, who deftly blends fresh 'white bread' dough with a micro-green pesto, formed into the shape of Former President George W. Bush. Don't be too hasty to indulge: allow your //amuse-ghoul// to first delight you with the sights and sounds of spot-on re-enactments of some of our former President's most entertaining //faux pas//.

= [[span style="color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold; font-family: 'Bellota'; border-bottom: 1px solid #ffffff;"]]@@ ★★★ First Course ★★★ @@[[/span]]
**Mambo Wings** -- It wouldn't be a trip to DC without having wings done in our local favorite Mambo sauce. Sink your teeth into free-range chicken, fried and rolled in our deliciously sweet and spicy sauce, but only after they pair off and perform a dazzling Mambo on your plate! With live music provided by your own carrot and celery bandstand, and served with house-made Bleu cheese dressing.

= [[span style="color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold; font-family: 'Bellota'; border-bottom: 1px solid #ffffff;"]]@@ ★★★ Main Course, choose one ★★★ @@[[/span]]
**Debate of the Clones** -- Cast your vote! You choose between our two daily rotating selections of house-cloned meats, sliced and cooked to order. Ask your server for recommendations, or visit our carving station, where you can watch as your selection is hand-carved from your preferred clone. The winning clone is served again tomorrow. Voted "Must-Have Dish" three years running in Subwashingtonian Magazine!

**Chicken and Waffles** -- Our take on a classic comfort food. Enjoy fresh-made waffles, smothered in real Maple syrup, along with fried dove or hawk. Your fowl may change, to hawk or dove, even mid-bite, according to the capricious whims of a force not even Chez himself understands.

**Half-Smoke** -- Our housemade pork-and-beef sausage, smoked to perfection, and served on split bun with onions and brown chili sauce.

= [[span style="color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold; font-family: 'Bellota'; border-bottom: 1px solid #ffffff;"]]@@ ★★★ Dessert ★★★ @@[[/span]]
**Our Famous Chocolate City Cake** -- Baked daily, with ingredients that mirror our great city's makeup. We opened with a 70% cacao slice of chocolate decadence; our current recipe is a complex delight of chocolate and vanilla layers, separated with a chipotle creme icing and topped with a soy-cinnamon glaze.

**The DMV** -- Named both for our favorite Metropolitan area, and our least-favorite metropolitan agency. Club soda, simple syrup, lemon and lime accompany our house-made sloe gin. How 'sloe', you ask? We partnered with the //chef de tempora// at our [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/ambrose-london-prix-fixe sister restaurant] in London to age this gin liquor for over 200 years!

**Eleanor Holmes Norton Antivirus** -- Named for our first elected Representative, this is our take on DC's Official Cocktail, the rickey. Bourbon, lime juice, and club soda, with just a dash of 15-year barrel-aged COVID-19 vaccine.

**Mayor for Life** -- Using a proprietary method, we infuse triple-distilled vodka with pure crack cocaine, add a splash of tonic and fresh lime. Because of our secret method, the cocaine will disappear from most patrons' bloodstreams within two hours. Ask your server for details.

Went with some friends for my first visit to this fabled spot. Was impressed. Service was impeccable, and the decor is wonderfully classy oak and brass as far as the mind's eye can see.

My favorite dish had to be their cloned meat. I couldn't decide between the Former Senator John Thune, or the Former Vice President Spiro Agnew, but my server recommended the Spiro, and I couldn't have been more pleased. Done to a perfect medium-rare, it nearly melted in my mouth. Will definitely be going back again!

Blech. Yet another out-of-district chain pretending to be "local." All the usual tripe, filled with political references with only cursory nods to the -actual- residents of DC. You know, us.

Go back to Three Portlands, or whatever hellhole you crawled out of. Your food is pretentious, your servers are snooty, and your decor is tres tacky.

And next time, think about maybe comping the check when you have a VERY IMPORTANT BLOGGER in your restaurant! Show some respect for local media!

FANTASTIC!!!

Rented out the backroom for my birthday bash, and was blown away! The staff seemed to anticipate my every need, and the drinks were to die for. I swear the Norton cocktail cured my friend's cold. 

As a special treat, I was allowed to pick one of their famous clone meats for the night! I chose former Tulsa Councilperson Adrianna Morrow. What a treat! When I arrived, I was taken by the charming manager, Jamal, to their carving station, where I got the first slice of Morrow. Not only that, but since I was the first served, Morrow was still conscious and aware enough for me to tell her what I *really* thought about the city's 2033 Waterworks Privatization Act. I thought for sure I'd only get to say a few words, but Jamal let me read her the whole damn riot act, even as they began to carve my my order of breastmeat. I know she was just a clone, but boy, did it feel good to tell her off. I swear I could still hear her sobbing during our dessert course, which made everything taste just that much better.

Thank you, Ambrose's, for making this my best birthday EVER.

Service was fine, and drinks were quick and a good size for the price.

My only complaint, after metroing all the way from Silver Spring, was that my half-smoke was... normal? Like, there were dancing chicken wings, and food that changed mid-bite, and whatever, but my half-smoke was just, like, a sausage.

I asked my server about it, like, you know, maybe it would cause me to hallucinate later, or age backwards or something, but all he said was "you don't fuck with a half-smoke." Lame.

Still, three stars, because it was really good.
