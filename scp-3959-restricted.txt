> **Item #:** SCP-3XXX
> 
> **Object Class:** Thaumiel
> 
> **Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3XXX is currently stored in a triple lead-lined containment chamber on Provisional Site-██. This facility was created for the express purpose of developing information-based thaumaturgic tools. At this time, no personnel under Level 4 clearance are to interact with SCP-3XXX.
> 
> SCP-3XXX is to be kept on a single personal computer within its containment chamber. Said computer is not to be connected to the internet or foundation servers at any time. In addition, no unauthorized devices or forms of media are to be brought within Site-██.
> 
> Information used in testing with SCP-3XXX must be logged and properly authorized first (See attached Item Log-3XXX for a complete list).
> 
> **Description:** SCP-3XXX is the designation for Thaumaturgic Class VIII Information Algorithm A3EN1. SCP-3XXX is the result of Project Callisto, the Foundation's first effort to create an operating anti-meme. The goal of the project was to engineer a custom abstraction to be assigned as a tag to any form of documentation. This results in the self-containment of cognitohazardous data, as well as the nullification of any infohazardous properties.
> 
> By using the attributes of several Safe and Euclid-Class Anomalies, specifically SCP-████ and SCP-███, the experiments were considered a success and A3EN1 is currently successfully weaponized.
> 
> **Addendum 3XXX-1-1A:** After reports of detrimental mental effects from personnel in close vicinity to A3EN1, a closer analysis revealed a mild cognitohazardous effect stemming from the properties of SCP-████'s application. Those with high cognitive resistance are seemingly immune to this. As of ██/██/████, all staff assigned to SCP-3XXX must score above a 40 on the Anomalous Cognition Resistance Scale.

= **WARNING: THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS CLASSIFIED**

= {{(LEVEL 5)}}

= FAILURE TO ABIDE BY SECURITY CLEARANCE MAY RESULT IN TERMINATION

> **Item #:** SCP-3XXX
> 
> **Object Class:** Keter
> 
> **Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3XXX cannot be contained. At this time, means of deterring SCP-3XXX from reaching SCP-3XXX-1 is considered a top priority. All Foundation documents are to be secured in Site-01, currently being constructed as a repository for relevant data. Falsified documents are to be distributed to sites of interest. These documents are to contain as much relevant data as possible, while remaining less than 50% factual. This has been shown to deter SCP-3XXX's consumption. 
> 
> SCP-3XXX-1 is to be contained in a maximum security chamber, sealed with a triple lead-lined Faraday cage. Periodic inspections of SCP-3XXX-1 are to take place daily by a trained member of the research team.
> 
> At no time are any forms of information to be brought into SCP-3XXX-1's containment area.
> 
> **Description:** SCP-3XXX is the designation for an extremely hostile rogue class VIII cognitohazard, formerly referred to as algorithm A3EN1. SCP-3XXX was created as a part of the now defunct project Callisto as an attempt to weaponize information. Despite multitudes of documentation, all involved have no recollection of having participated in the project.
> 
> SCP-3XXX has infovorous tendencies, as was expected as part of the project's outline. SCP-3XXX will gravitate towards large volumes of data in attempt to consume it. Items currently being "fed" on automatically redact their own information, as well as creating a weak antimemetic effect. Any information consumed by SCP-3XXX is essentially permanently lost, both from all documentation and all of human memory. Whether SCP-3XXX is causing a retroactive change in causality or simply erasing all knowledge of the affected information remains unknown, and due to the aforementioned antimemetic effects, may never be discovered. 
> 
> At no time should SCP-3XXX come in contact with [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-140 SCP-140].
> 
> Although SCP-3XXX prefers large quantities of data, it has shown to be most interested in returning to SCP-3XXX-1.
> 
> SCP-3XXX-1 refers to former Anomalous Item 38719 (See [http://www.scp-wiki.net/log-of-anomalous-items **Log of Anomalous Items**] for a complete list). SCP-3XXX-1 is a large, indestructible textbook of unknown origin. SCP-3XXX-1 was in transport to Site-19 from a temporary storage container several miles outside of Site-██ during SCP-3XXX's first containment breach. SCP-3XXX reportedly entered the vehicle via the radio and eventually came in contact with SCP-3XXX-1. This was not detected until █ hours later, where it was removed via contact with SCP-████ (Now Neutralized).
> 
> SCP-3XXX-1 contains a complete history of the human race and references events that are unrecorded until its acquisition. In addition, subsequent readings have revealed the addition of new pages in accordance to modern events. As of ██/██/████, the first 248 pages are completely redacted.
> 
> The progress of SCP-3XXX's consumption of SCP-3XXX has currently halted at the year ████, referencing the events of ████████ ████ and █████ ████ ████████.
> 
> This document is the only record of SCP-3XXX-1's location. At the current rate, it is projected that SCP-3XXX can completely overtake SCP-3XXX-1 within ██ hours. Doing so would most likely result in an EK-Class Consciousness Collapse Event and/or a CK-Class Reality Restructuring Event.
> 
> Despite all containment procedures involved, containment breach is imminent, as SCP-3XXX is capable of infesting a wide variety of hosts, including but not limited to humans. Those who SCP-3XXX prefers to occupy are usually individuals with acute eidetic memory, but it has been shown to choose random individuals with seemingly no preference. When infesting a human, SCP-3XXX will feed on long term memories before short term, replicating symptoms of Alzheimer's over a period of several hours. Most do not notice any sort of change during this period, aside from light confusion.
> 
> **Incident Report 3XXX-1A:**
> 
> On ██/██/████, an attempt was made to terminate SCP-3XXX via an unknown means. Knowledge of the termination attempt, the location of the test, and all involved were lost. In a later inventory check of Site-██, it was found that a single mirror was missing from Room 311 in sublevel 4. Correlation between the two is considered speculative at this point
