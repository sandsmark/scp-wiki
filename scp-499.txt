**Item #:** SCP-499

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-499 is to be contained within a circular containment unit, measuring twenty (20) meters in diameter, at Site-██.  The chamber is to be treated to withstand temperatures of up to 700º C. The chamber is not to be entered during daylight hours except in cases of extreme emergency. If the chamber must be entered, personnel are to wear a Grade 3 Heat Hazard Suit and appropriate eye protection. 

During nighttime hours, SCP-499 is to be provided with bedding and a shallow pan filled with a combination of sand, sawdust, and store-grade cat litter.  Food, water, and medication are to be supplied in appropriate amounts at this time. All loose items in the chamber are to be removed for cleaning before sunrise. Under no circumstances is SCP-499’s behavior to be interrupted.

**Description:** SCP-499 is a humanoid creature standing one and three-quarter meters tall (5.7 feet). The subject’s skin is loose, thick, and hairless, and is a mottled grey-brown in coloration. There is heavy burn scarring present on the subject’s body, primarily on the back. SCP-499 is incapable of vocal communication beyond simplistic mumbling, due to a larynx and respiratory system heavily damaged by smoke inhalation. SCP-499 avoids all attempts at direct human interaction.

Medical testing upon retrieval showed that SCP-499 is at least eighty years old. It clearly displays the physical effects of aging, including a weak heart, poor eyesight, and moderate to severe arthritis of joints in its body. (Due to this, ██ mg of [REDACTED] has been added to its daily water, as well as ██ mg of [REDACTED], a high-intensity painkiller). Alongside this, x-ray analysis has shown no less than twenty-one (21) healed bone breaks and hairline fractures, most in the ribs and left leg. The combination of these factors gives SCP-499 a pronounced limp and hunched appearance.
 
SCP-499 is bound within a metal harness fitted around the torso, as well as wrist and ankle shackles. A metal sphere, forty-five (45) centimeters in diameter, is connected to the harness by several thick chains, each approximately three (3) meters long. Three of these chains are connected to the harness itself, and one to each shackle. Any attempt to remove the harness or chains directly been met with physical violence from SCP-499, leading to the loss of Dr. █████████’s right hand. 

At sunrise local time, the sphere will begin to float, emitting intense light and heat. SCP-499 will then walk in a circle around the chamber, pulling the sphere behind it. The sphere’s position in the air will correlate with the alignment of the sun at that point in time: The angle of the sphere to the floor will be equal to the angle of the sun to the horizon. At sunset, local time, the sphere will return to its inactive metallic state.

The action of pulling the sphere is seen to require sizable effort and cause SCP-499 extreme pain. An increase in painkiller dosage is not advised, as an increase in the current amount would pose a significant health risk to SCP-499.  

**Addendum-01:** After sedating the subject, an investigation of the harness revealed that it is constructed of metal of unknown composition, and is resistant to all attempts to remove it.

**Document 499-W3:** At 2:33 P.M., ██/██/20██, SCP-499 collapsed for unknown reasons. The medical staff on hand managed to resuscitate the subject after twenty-eight minutes, at which point SCP-499 continued its circuit. During the twenty-eight minutes of inactivity, the the sun was seen to remain at the same angle respective to the horizon without change. When SCP-499 resumed usual behavior, the sun returned to its appropriate position and movement. Appropriate cover-up measures in the affected area were taken immediately afterwards.

Researcher's Note: //That was the longest twenty-eight minutes of my life. And now the poor bastard looks worse than ever...// - Dr. ██████.
