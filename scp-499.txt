**Item #:** SCP-499

**Object Class:** Safe/Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-499 is to be kept in a standard size humanoid containment unit with the door locked at all times. Subject is to be provided with bedding and a shallow pan filled with a combination of sand, sawdust, and store-grade cat litter. Simple recreational items such as children’s toys or art supplies may be permitted with approval of a Level 2 staff member. Food and water is to be supplied twice daily, and the “sandbox” is to be cleaned of feces and other excrement every other day. Subject’s behavior is to be monitored remotely and recorded. All staff entering the containment unit are to be overseen by two armed guards. 

SCP-499 is sentient but senile. If communication is ever successful, the case will come under review for possible extension of privileges or additional security measures. 

**Description:** SCP-499 is a humanoid creature of unknown origin. Subject is bipedal, standing one and three-quarter meters tall (5.7 feet). The subject’s skin is loose, thick, and hairless, and is a mottled grey-brown in coloration. There are numerous scars and welts present on the subject’s body, most of which are centered on the subject’s back and torso. The age of these wounds ranges from several decades to a few months (at the time of retrieval). The largest and most recent runs over the subject’s right shoulder. The wound is still healing and will occasionally leak a green fluid.

SCP-499 communicates by inflating a pouch of skin under its neck and expelling the air through eight sphincter-controlled breathing holes that run down the spine from the base of the skull to the shoulder blades. This system creates a variety of noises, none of which can be replicated by humans. Likewise, SCP-499’s mouth structure has been found to be incapable of human speech, and SCP-499 itself has shown no desire for an alternative form of contact.
 
Medical testing upon retrieval has shown that SCP-499 is at least eighty years old, and clearly displays the physical effects of aging: Subject is chronically fatigued, has a weak heart, poor eyesight, and most joints in the subject’s body are worn down and moderately to severely arthritic. (Due to this, ██ mg of [Redacted] has been added to its daily water). X-ray analysis has shown no less than twenty-one (21) healed bone breaks and hairline fractures, most in the ribs and left leg. The combination of these factors has given SCP-499 a pronounced limp and hunched appearance.

SCP-499 will more than likely ignore any researchers entering the containment unit. If there is interaction, SCP-499 will go out of its way to make it as quick as possible.

**Addendum:**
SCP-499’s anomalous behavior manifested approximately one week after retrieval. Using a mixture of water, excrement, and pus from its shoulder wound, SCP-499 painted a short figure on the wall, consisting of a simple humanoid outline and a small mark painted in the torso region of the figure. Upon completion, SCP-499 sat down in front of the figure (heretofore referred to as SCP-499-01) and proceeded to “speak” to it. The tone and timing of these vocalizations indicate that SCP-499 was fulfilling one part of a two-person dialogue. SCP-499 has repeated this behavior with all of the figures it has painted. 

The tally of figures is currently:
•	3 made using a mixture of water, pus, and excrement.
•	23 made using children’s finger paints of mixed colors. (Supplied by the research team)
•	15 made using store-bought house paints of mixed colors. (Supplied by the research team)
•	██/██/200█: For details on figures SCP-499-42 to SCP-499-45, see Document 499-a.

**Document 499-a:**
██/██/200█: Subject upgraded from Safe to Safe/Euclid after the deaths of two researchers during a routine unit cleaning. Researchers were physically attacked by SCP-499 resulting in severe internal organ damage and cranial trauma to Dr. ████████. Dr. ████ suffered major breaks in his shoulder joints, knees, and neck. Immediately afterward, SCP-499 took a bite out of Dr. ████████’s arm, which caused the subject to vomit violently. Following this, SCP-499 proceeded to paint four more figures on the wall using the blood and vomit. Of note are figures SCP-499-42 and SCP-499-43, which were drawn in a style differing from the other figures, and SCP-499-45, which bears a strong resemblance to [Data Expunged].

SCP-499 had returned to its normal behavior by the time the bodies were retrieved by security personnel, but was noted to be bed-ridden and in severe pain for the nest three days.
