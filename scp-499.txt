**Item #:** SCP-499

**Object Class:** Euclid 

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-499 and SCP-499-2 are to be contained within an underground containment unit at Site-██. The chamber is to be treated to withstand temperatures of up to 700º C, and is not to be entered during daylight hours except in cases of extreme emergency. If the chamber must be entered, personnel are to wear a Grade 3 Heat Hazard Suit and appropriate eye protection. 

During nighttime hours, SCP-499 is to be provided with bedding and a shallow pan filled with a combination of sand, sawdust, and store-grade cat litter.  Food, water, and medication are to be supplied in appropriate amounts at this time. All loose items in the chamber are to be removed for cleaning before sunrise. 

**Description:** SCP-499 is an elderly male of indeterminate race, approximately eighty years old and standing 1.6 meters (5.1 feet)  tall. The subject’s skin is thick and hairless, due to the heavy burn scarring present on the subject’s body. SCP-499 suffers from numerous medical conditions due to its advanced age, the most prominent being the subject’s advanced state of dementia. SCP-499’s behavior is similar to that of feral children: actively avoiding direct human interaction and becoming violent when cornered (one such incident leading to the loss of Dr. █████████’s right hand.) It is not believed that SCP-499 can be rehabilitated. 

SCP-499’s other medical conditions include a weak heart, eyesight damaged to the point of near-blindness, and moderate to severe arthritis in most joints. 

SCP-499 is always in the presence of SCP-499-2, a metal sphere of unknown composition measuring 45 cm (1.48 ft) in diameter and weighing approximately .4kg (.9 lbs). SCP-499 treats SCP-499-2 as a child would a favorite toy, rolling it around on the floor and otherwise interacting with it in a playful manner. All attempts to take SCP-499-2 away from SCP-499 have been met with physical violence from SCP-499.

When SCP-499 is interacting with SCP-499-2, it will give off intense emissions of light and heat, with measurements of heat emissions of up to 650º C and a luminosity equivalent of one five-hundredth that of the sun. This play will begin at sunrise and end at sunset: during this period, SCP-499 will not be deterred by outside stimuli. At sunset, local time, SCP-499 will cease its play and the sphere will return to its inactive metallic state.

**Incident Report 499-1** At 2:33 P.M. ██/██/████, SCP-499 collapsed due to unknown reasons, followed quickly be the de-activation of SCP-499-2. The medical staff on hand managed to resuscitate the subject after twenty-eight minutes, at which point SCP-499 resumed play with SCP-499-2 as usual. During this time, several reports of a solar eclipse were reported by civilians in the area around Site-██. This phenomenon persisted until approximately 3:01 P.M.
