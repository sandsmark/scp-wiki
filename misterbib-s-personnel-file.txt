[[/div]]

**Name:** C████ Bib███████

**Code Name:** "Mister Bibs" ("Bibs" in casual conversation)

**Security Clearance:** 4 

**Position (Primary):** Agent

**Position (Secondary):** Researcher (Level 2 clearance, security authorization M1L132)

**Residence:** Site-██, retrofitted Containment Room #835354 [[footnote]] ,,Despite repeated suggestions to use a standard-issue domicile, Bibs is adamant about keeping #835354 for his own. O5-█ has ordered the issue dropped, owing to the cost of having to restore #835354 to a usable state, --as well as Bib's insistence that he would [DATA EXPUNGED] if forced to relocate-- It sounds mean when you say it like that. I play my music loud, and I sing badly. Nobody would get a wink of sleep in the dormitories. Christ.,, [[/footnote]]

**Pre-Foundation History:** MisterBibs's first interaction with the Foundation occurred on ██/██/20██, during an escape attempt of SCP-███. Bibs autonomously assisted Foundation personnel by [DATA REDACTED], greatly decreasing the loss of life during the recapture. Bibs explained (at considerable length) the reasoning behind his actions, citing numerous fictional stories with similar entities. Believing that he might be a valuable asset to the Foundation despite little high-end education, Bibs was not given the standard dose of Class-A amnesiacs. After being interviewed by O5-█, Bibs was recruited into the Foundation.

**Profile:** With a nondescript look and mannerism, Bibs excels at covert infiltration and in-the-field investigative duties. To date, he has been involved in the investigation or initial appraisal of ██ potential SCPs, with only █ detections. Bibs describes his infiltration style as //"James Bond meets the Second Doctor"//, focusing on appearing to potential threats as innocuous and unprepared. Personnel critical of Bib's methods typically argue that he //is// as unprepared as he acts, a notion that Bibs admits is "kinda sorta true, half the time, but that's why it works so █████████ well most of the time!".

When not deployed to the field as an Agent, Bibs will, if left to his own devices, wander around, assisting in tasks which pique his interests. He identifies himself as "profoundly stupid", insisting that his skillsets comes from "having too much time on [his] hands growing up" and over-consumption of fictional material. 

Despite his obnoxious and self-deprecating attitude, Bibs constantly seeks validation from Foundation personnel, especially from those of the senior staff and those with higher education. Often Bibs will spend his off hours assisting Foundation staff, brushing off any compliments with a simple //"I was bored"// or //"I saw this in// [DATA EXPUNGED] //a few times, and trust me, it always went really bad."//. After numerous requests for access to research files during his off-hours, Bibs was given Level 2 Researcher duties on ██/██/20██.
