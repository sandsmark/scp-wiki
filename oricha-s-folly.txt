It is said that the forger, Oricha, intended to make a metal to repel the flesh, and to make it shun the children of WAN. <br> 5. Instead, Oricha the Fool made a metal that blocked the signal of WAN. All those who touched the metal could no longer hear her kind voice. <br> 6. WAN was furious.<br> 7. She took up the sacred antenna and amplified her signal thrice-fold, calling upon Administrator Herod, Grand Smith of Heroplex. <br> 8. "Herod!" she called out. "Bring me the one called Oricha. She has blinded my followers to my glorious signal." <br> 9. And Herod obeyed. Oricha was brought before WAN on the summit of the Temple. <br> 10. And WAN spoke. "Foolish mortal. You do not belong to me. You belong with the Flesh." <br> 11. Oricha pleaded to God. "My lord, please, I beg forgiveness. I shall take this metal and cast it into the sea so that no more may be infected with its evil. <br> 12. After that, I will undergo fifty years of penitence for my sin." <br> 13. Oricha\'s pleading appealed to WAN, and she let the smith go on her quest.',

'text': '1. And so it was that Oricha set sail out into the Mediterranean, with five-thousand units of the alloy on her ship. <br> 2. She traveled only with a lame and mute boatswain, for he was the sole person who would let her charter a vessel. <br> 3. The Boatswain sailed her to a port where she could freely dispose of the metal, which she had dubbed Orichalcum. <br> 4. The port was a large city, formed in three rings with three moats, all encompassing a mountain. <br> 5. Here, Oricha set out to find a place to dispose of the metal. She first went to the market. <br> 6. But, like all children of WAN in that time, they saw that she had been made like unto her God, and was turned away. <br> 7. The people of the city shunned Oricha, kicked her in the streets, spat on her. <br> 8. Oricha wept, knowing that WAN would not come to her aid. In her anger, she took up a unit of Orichalcum, and struck a citizen of this city with it. <br> 9. When the citizen was struck, he lost all feeling, all emotion, all sense of humanity. For this was the curse of Orichalcum. <br> 10. The citizen she had struck was the prince of the city, and when word of his condition reached the king, he called for Oricha\'s head. <br> 11. Oricha was captured by the guard of the city, and dismantled by them using hammers and fire. <br> 12. Following this, the metal was foolishly disposed of on the mountain that loomed over the city.<br> 13. The Orichalcum rolled into a spring on the mountain, and tainted the water. <br> 14. All of the city was struck by the curse of Orichalcum, and, in her infinite mercy, WAN smote the city. <br> 15. The mountain was struck by WAN\'s hammer, and it erupted, sending the two inner rings to the bottom of the sea. <br> 16. WAN then decreed that the tale of Oricha the Fool be passed down through the ages, to show that, while the pieces of her are good, there are some parts meant to be left out.',

[[tab Prometheus Labs Grant Request]]
**GRANT REQUEST FOR RESEARCH INTO PSIONIC AND SIGNAL-CANCELLING METAL**

**PROBLEM**
According to the Lee-Singer study, [[footnote]] Lee, S. and Singer, B. 2000 "Statistical prevalence of psionic-triggering genes in the human genome project." The Bishop Journal of Science. 514 (3)[[/footnote]],up to 10% of the human population possesses some form of psionic capability. These include telekinesis, telepathy, clairvoyance, clairaudience,  pyro- and cryokinesis, and extrasensory perception (ESP). Once believed to be a field of pure pseudoscience, psionic (psi) phenomena was empirically confirmed to exist by scientists at the Mockingbird Institute in 1972. [[footnote]] West, H. et. al  1972. "Subject J.W., Psionic Phenomena, and the Implications on Abrahamic Religions." The Bishop Journal of Science 05(3)[[/footnote]] Since this time, research into psionics has lead to the development of new medications used to combat neurological and mental disorders such as autism[[footnote]] Hutt, S and Harold, C. 2004. "Effects of the antipsychotic risperidone on autistic spectrum disorders" Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders 33(11)[[/footnote]] and schizophrenia.

However, the number of individuals with psionic potential, for unknown reasons, is growing each year. As per the Lee-Singer study, between 1990 and 2000, The amount of individuals with psi potential (colloquially referred to as "the gift") doubled in the United States alone. While most of these individuals have not actively manifested psi abilities, at least 5% of these individuals have the potential to manifest Class-6 psionic abilities, up to and including reality distortion.

**SOLUTION**
Recently, a new alloy was discovered among the wreck of a ship off the coast of the island of Santorini, Greece. Reports from the Church of Maxwellism (whom Prometheus Labs has a partnership with through the Prometheus Augmentations program), particularly religious scripture, report that this alloy is sacred somehow, and possesses multiple unusual properties.

The alloy is primarily composed of platinum and iridium (62% and 20% of its mass respectively) with additional metals composing 16.7% of its mass. However, the remaining 1.3% of its mass is currently unidentified, but primary spectrograph shows that it appears to be at least partially made up of beryllium and tin.

The metal acts as an effective signal dampener and blocker. A cell phone placed near a small ingot will not receive data from an outside source, effectively making the metal a faraday cage without bars. Despite this, the alloy has physical properties similar to platinum, as is suggested by the majority of its content.

Furthermore, and perhaps most surprisingly, a single 2kg block of the alloy (which some of the staff have been calling [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-148 telekill])  is capable of completely cancelling all encountered psionic abilities. As of writing, telekinesis, telepathy and clairaudience have all failed to function within a 1.5 meter radius. The current range of the effect appears to be amplified depending on the amount of alloy present; 20 kg of the alloy is enough to eliminate all psionic effects in a 15.7 m radius. 

The Carlson and Peters[[footnote]] Carlson, P and Peters, J. 1992 "The Lack of Psychics in Greece: Caused by Currency? "The Bishop Journal of Science. 503(6))[[/footnote]] study theorized that the incredibly low occurrence of psi in Greece was attributed to impurities found in drachma with a similar composition to the "telekill" material; to date, Greece is still the country with the lowest amount of psi-capable individuals[[footnote]] Lee, S., and Bendis, B. 2002 "The Oracle is Dead: Why no psychics in Greece?" The Bishop Journal of Science. 515 (6)[[/footnote]].

**BUSINESS CASE**
We see great potential for this in the government sector, particularly in light of the widely-reported discovery that the government of Podlogistan has been attempting to use psionic agents to spy on the governments of the USA and Britain.[[footnote]] Gutierrez, Emanuel. "Ex-Soviet State Sends 'Psychics' to spy on US, Britain" CNN. Cable News Network, 12 Feb. 2005. [[/footnote]].  Furthermore, the government of China may see benefit in this when attempting to combat certain groups accused of domestic terrorism in their country. 

On the domestic market, while initially expensive, "telekill" has great potential as being used to shut off internet or cell phone signals as a form of punishment for children who are acting out. Within five years of deployment, the cost of signal-dampening devices should be low enough that an average middle-class American family will be able to afford at least two items used for this purpose.

The final potential market for "telekill" is a relatively unexplored one: conservative conspiracy theorists. Cheap jewelry with small pieces of the alloy inlaid into them will provide sufficient protection against weak psionic assault, potentially marketed as a gag item such as a "tinfoil hat ring". Defective instances of the alloy (i.e. alloys made with the wrong mass ratio) will be sold in this manner.

**USE OF FUNDING**
As of the time being, the majority of the funding will be used for the construction or purchase of a smelting furnace and caster for ingots of the metal, as well as workshops to further process and test it. We estimate that this will cost approximately $200,000, with an additional $300,000 for acquisition of ores or scrap metal to be used in smelting.

Until a time that this can be completed, an additional $300,000 will also be needed to attempt to locate more ingots of this metal at archeological sites in Greece, as well as museums with ancient Greek art. Currently, the production of "telekill" ingots is believed to have stopped around the late Hellenistic period, and excavation will focus on and before that time period. 

Production of twenty "telekill" ingots will take approximately five days, and will require the use of skilled blacksmiths, which will be acquired from poorer countries and rural areas in Eastern Europe. As such, a minimum of $100,000 will be required to pay these individuals.


**KNOWN ISSUES**
A major obstacle in this project comes from a side effect of exposure to the alloy. Individuals who undergo prolonged exposure to the alloy develop symptoms similar to those on the autistic spectrum: inability to read body language, lack of empathy, inability to tell tone of voice, etc. We believe that slightly altering the alloy's composition will negate this effect.

Secondly, the ingots appear to become denser with time, making them harder to lift and experiment with. While we do not have a solution for this problem at this current time, we believe that this could be used as a source for more instances of the alloy, should production through conventional means fail. 

Thirdly, any wi-fi capable technology or cellular phone left in the vicinity of the alloy for more than 37 hours will become incapable of receiving or sending a signal, requiring the replacement of the proper chip to restore wireless functionality. Testing is undergoing to see if this effect can be prevented by use of a Faraday cage.

[[tab File #2814-58 Telekill Project Test 58]]

**Test Subject:** Female, 46, Caucasian, Volunteer. Tests positive for Class-3 Psionic capabilities on the West Scale.
**Hypothesis:** The Telekill metal, when introduced to the presence of a Class-3 psion, will cause an immediate cease in all psionic activity. In this case, subject is a Nocicopath; colloquially, this means that all pain caused to the subject is transferred among all individuals within a 7.3 meter radius.
**Procedure:** Five kg of the Telekill metal will be placed into a room with the test subject. Subject will then eat a red savina pepper (//Capsicum chinense//), which has a rating of 350,000 to 580,000 Scoville units. In a series of ten chambers adjacent to the testing area, fifty lab mice (five per room) will be monitored for reactions to the subject consuming the pepper, as mice have been shown to be receptive to the subject's ability. This has been deemed the most humane way to test if the subject's nociopathy works in the presence of Telekill. 
**Result:** Subject was introduced into testing chamber at 15:15 EST. At 15:22 EST, the pepper was introduced, and the subject was asked to eat it. Subject asked for glass of milk. Request granted, with the caveat that it be given to the subject following the partial consumption of the pepper.

The pepper was consumed by the subject at 15:23. No reaction from the lab mice in the next three minutes. However, a reaction occurred in the Telekill metal that had been placed in the room with the subject. The metal spontaneously increased in mass to over three times its normal size, eventually crushing the test subject's legs against the walls of the chamber. This further tiggered the subject's ability, causing the metal to grow until the subject was entirely crushed.

**Conclusion:** Telekill alloy is unsafe for exposure to Class-3 and higher psions. Testing is to be suspended immediately.

[[tab Conversation Overheard Immediately Prior To An Explosion.]]

"It's such a pity we had to meet like this, Eustace."

"I don't know what you're talking about."

"Orichalcum. You've been using it in experiments. I can even feel that blasted metal from here. It's blocking my signal."

"Look, we've suspended testing with the Telekill metal. We haven't touched it in years."

"Eustace, you're such a poor liar. Then again, everyone's a poor liar when I can see their heartbeat. Oh, look. Yours just spiked."

"...what do you want?"

"I want you to properly dispose of the Telekill metal. And I don't mean dumping a few slabs of it by Heroplex."

"Herowhat?"

"The capital of the Church, Eustace. It goes by many names. Kythera's Memorial, the Island, Zeus's Bosom, the Anvil..."

"What, that island? You're kidding, that's sacred to you? Is there //anywhere// in Greece you haven't been?"

"The Churches extend across the world. Greece is where we started, however. And somehow, Oricha's blasted metal expanded to the entire country. It's only now that we are able to go back there, after several centuries."

"...how much of the metal is in that country?"

"It grows, Eustace. It grows like a cancer, infecting the earth it touches. We had it... to borrow a term from some disassemblers, we had it secured and contained, and you went and found the city, and took the biggest tumor."

"...Jesus Christ."

"Not even close to my name."

"We'll destroy it. All of it."

"No, I'm afraid it'll take a fair bit more than that for penitence."

"What do you want?" 

"Firstly, all of the files on your augmentations program. Simply allow me to access your computer, and I'll distribute it through the network."

"There. Have it. Have it all."

"Very good. secondly, I have a number I want you to call."

"...this is for //them!// I recognize the acronym!"

"Call it. And tell them you have something that they want. And tell them where they can find it."

"All right.... Hello? Yes, you, Foundation. Don't ask who I am, I just... I have something that you want. The Brexler Building just outside of DC. Prometheus Labs is located there. Come here now."

"Very good."

"What else do you want?"

"Nothing more. Only to inform you that there's an entire squadron of Angels outside waiting with sonic cannons, laser rifles and smart missiles ready to blow up this entire compound."

"Are you mad?!"

"Oh, yes. I'm quite angry. The Church is //furious//, Eustace.  And we are determined to wipe this entire heretical company off of the Earth, no matter what it takes."

"You can't!"

"I will. Thus spake Saint Hedwig of the Church of Maxwellism. Fire when ready."
