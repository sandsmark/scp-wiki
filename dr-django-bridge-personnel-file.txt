[[/div]]

**Name:** Dr. Django Bridge
**Security Clearance:** 2
**Duties:** Archivist 

**History:** Dr. Bridge [EXPUNGED]. He was then transferred to Site ██ and given training. After proving himself capable of remembering perfectly the designation of all SCP objects he has clearance for, Bridge [REDACTED]. 

After initial orientation, Dr. Bridge requisitioned $████ worth of equipment to build a gasoline powered combat armour covered in chainsaw-like blades, after which Bridge attempted to produce a new, automatically encrypted OS for Foundation computer systems. However, in initial testing stages, [EXPUNGED PENDING SCP DESIGNATION], causing severe muscular degeneration to himself and the six Class-D personnel present at the time. He has made a reasonable recovery, and has been reinstated to his former position.

Dr. Bridge has a propensity to categorize and define SCP objects in inane and/or arbitrary ways. So long as he keeps with Foundation standards while working with official documentation, this has been deemed harmless. However, Dr. Bridge is no longer allowed to requisition funds without the approval of at least 3 Level 3 personnel, and is under psychiatric probation until December 2012.

In addition, Dr Bridge is, in his own words, an "Unusual Vehicle Enthusiast". This has been deemed harmless, provided that he does not requisition Foundation funds for his personal collection.
