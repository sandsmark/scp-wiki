title:Random But Useful
This page is a collection of information that I've found useful, and maybe others will find something useful as well. This is a work in progress pretty much by design.

+ **Style Sheet**

This Style Sheet is to help me develop and compile a standard way of formatting stuff for SCP articles. This is by no means an official document, though I'm going to list formats for official terminology that (I hope) are used consistently among SCP articles.

# **Measurements:** In a measurement, add a space between the number and the unit (e.g., 2 m). Don't add a comma to a compound measurement (e.g., 5 ft 10 in). Decimal values between -1 and 1 should have a zero in the units place (e.g., 0.4 g). _
__Exceptions__:
 * Temperature: 20°C
 * Latitude and longitude: 40°N, 85°W
 * Percent: 10%
 * Acidity: pH 3.4
 * Caliber: Beretta 9mm
# **Significant digits:** Broadly, in a measurement, all digits 1 through 9 as well as 0s between non-zero digits are significant digits (e.g., 12000 kg has two siginificant digits, while 12007 kg has five). The number of significant digits of a measurement is determined by how precisely the measurement can be taken. The number of significant digits should remain constant when a measurement is converted (e.g., 12000 kg = 26000 lb, but 12007 kg = 26415 lb). See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Significant_figures Wikipedia] for more information. _
__Rule of thumb__:
 * Rough estimates, ballpark figures, and difficult measurements get one or two significant digits.
 * Standard measurements get three or four digits.
 * Getting five or six digits requires good equipment, and any more would require exponentially better equipment or special circumstances.
 * __Exception__: GPSs can give latitude and longitude to six decimal places, meaning GPS readings routinely give eight or nine significant digits. [confirm]
# **Punctuation**
 * Commas: Generally, as long as a comma doesn't split a subject from its verb (unless setting off a parenthetical phrase) and doesn't break the flow of a sentence (that is, don't put a comma where you wouldn't pause if the sentence were spoken aloud), go nuts. 
 * Hyphens: Use hyphens in words that a dictionary says are hyphenated, and in compound modifiers that would be ambiguous otherwise. Note that Ghost will remove any hyphens he feels are unnecessary.
 * Apostrophes: The only plurals that use an apostrophe are single letters (e.g., mind your p's and q's). No other plural takes an apostrophe, including acronyms and numbers (e.g., SCPs or 1980s). I got over it, and so can you.
 * Semicolons: Semicolons join sentences in place of a comma plus conjunction, and with adverbs like "however". They are also used to separate items in a list that include commas already.
# **Terminology**
 * Technically, an SCP is the Special Containment Procedure for an item that is contained. Calling an object that is contained an SCP is incorrect usage and should be avoided in technical and official documentation. Colloquially, however, contained objects are often referred to as SCPs, and may be referred to as such in less formal settings.
 * Foundation is always capitalized, though any the before it need not be.
 * Classes are always capitalized: Safe, Euclid, and Keter.
 * Site names are capitalized and hyphenated, and their numbers have at least two digits: Site-19, Area-02.
 * Overseers are O5 level-- letter oh, number five. Individual O5s are numbered 1 through 13, thus O5-1, O5-2, through O5-13. A leading zero is sometimes added to 1 through 9: O5-01. 
# **Binomial nomenclature:** There is a very specific set of rules for formatting organisms' scientific names.
 * Species names are always italicized. They consist of two words: the first word is the genus name and the second is the specific epithet. The genus name is always capitalized, and the specific epithet never is: //Homo sapiens//, //Cymothoa exigua//, //Hypsibius dujardini//. Names of genera may be used alone, to refer to all species in the genus: //Homo//, //Cymothoa//, //Hypsibus//.
 * Names of higher-level taxa -- families, orders, classes, phyla, kingdoms -- are capitalized, but not italicized: Hominidae, Hymenophyllaceae, Malacostraca, Tardigrada.
 * To denote a subspecies, just add the second specific epithet: //Homo sapiens sapiens//, //Ursus arctos horribilis//.
  * To denote a hybrid, add the multiplication sign between the two specific epithets: //Platanus occidentalis// x //orientalis//. For named hybrids, place the multiplication sign between the genus name and the hybrid's specific epithet: //Platanus// x //hispanica//.
  * To denote a variety, add "var." (not italicized) before the second specific epithet: //Hebe salicifolia// var. //stricta//.
  * To denote a cultivar, add "cv." after the genus name: //Dionaea// cv. For a named cultivar, use the name in quotation marks instead of the abbreviation: //Dionaea// "Fancy Traps".
 * When a species is mentioned several times in the same report, or when two species of the same genus are referred to in quick succession, the genus name can be abbreviated after the first time. Replace it with its initial: //H. sapiens//, //C. exigua//, //H. dujardini//.
 * For further details, see Wikipedia's articles on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_nomenclature binomial nomenclature] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_classification biological classification].

+ **Editing Tips**

**N.B.** Even though I've been promoted to Senior Staff (a decision which still boggles my mind), I don’t want to give the impression of speaking for or on behalf of the rest of the Staff. The information that follows comes mainly from observation, experience, common sense, and being scolded by the Staff at least ████████████ times. 

**Rule Zero: Show some civility and respect.**
Show some common courtesy to your fellow site members, and some respect for the site and the people who run it. If you’re a jack-ass, people will hold a negative opinion of anything you do before even looking at it. 

**Rule One: Always leave a note about what kind of change was made.**
Down under the main editing box is a small textbox titled "Short description of changes". Text entered here shows as comments on the Recent Changes list and the version history of the page in question. Your changes will be more likely to be received favorably if people know what to expect. Note that once saved, these comments can't be edited. 

**Specific Suggestions**
Start small. 
When in doubt, ask in the forum and/or in the chat.
Use a [http://dictionary.reference.com/ dictionary].
Don’t piss off the staff.
You will not please everyone all the time.
Treat Technical Writing and Creative Writing differently.
Edit longer documents in a word processing program.
Listen.
Use the tools (preview, compare, chat).
Learn how Wikidot formats documents.
Learn about specific admonitions from admins.
Preview substantial revisions in Pastebin.
Don't edit while impaired (sleepy, drunk, or otherwise loopy).
Follow recent changes.

**Rule Infinity: Show some respect and civility.**
See Rule Zero.

+ **Classes**

Not sure what class to make your SCP? Try the Locked Box test:
* If you can lock the thing away somewhere, leave it alone, and nothing will happen, the thing is Safe.
* If you lock something away somewhere and leave it alone, but there's no telling what will happen, it's Euclid.
* If you lock something away, leave it alone, and all hell breaks loose, it's Keter.

Also, I'm on a personal crusade against [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/t-172828/ SCP Slash]. There are only a few cases where assigning more than one class to an object makes any sense, often involving a provisional classification. That [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/t-172828#post-549071 other kind] is, um, frowned upon as well.

+ **IQ** 

The statistic called [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_quotient IQ] (Intelligence Quotient) is defined as a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution normal distribution] with mean μ=100 and standard deviation σ=15. The upshot is that you can calculate what percentage of a population should have an IQ above (or below) certain values, especially when Wikipedia [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution#Standard_deviation_and_confidence_intervals provides] these values out to 6σ. Anyway, the percentage of population with greater than a given IQ:

@@>100: 50.00%, 1 out of every 2@@
@@>115: 15.87%, 1 out of every 6@@
@@>130: 2.275%, 1 out of every 44@@
@@>145: 0.1350%, 1 out of every 741@@
@@>160: 0.003167%, 1 out of every 31,574@@
@@>175: 0.00002867%, 1 out of every 3,488,557@@
@@>190: 0.00000009865%, 1 out of every 1,013,684,744@@

So right now, there should be six or seven people in the whole world with an IQ of at least 190. (Conversely, there should also be six or seven people in the world right now with an IQ of less than 10.) How IQ is actually quantified is left as an exercise to the reader (though the method used isn't so important if they all use the same scale).

What about [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilyn_vos_Savant Marilyn vos Savant] and her record high IQ? Essentially, her score of 228 came from older testing methodologies (using the ratio of mental age to chronological age) and so she wouldn't score so high on newer tests, in addition to the inherent difficulties in measuring extremes of intelligence. On this scale, she would score at least 185.
