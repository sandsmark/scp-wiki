**Item #:** SCP-1703

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures**: SCP-1703 may be kept in a 35cm x 35cm x 35cm fiberglass cube with walls at least 8mm wide that is padded with a thick layer of black industrial foam on the outside. The interior of the cube is to be painted black with an opaque paint. The cube may be opened and closed with a metallic hinge mechanism. It may be kept locked with a simple combination lock and stored in secure storage among other Safe SCPs. Observational research may be conducted on the object at any time, as long as it remains within the box, and the box is not opened. Experiments which involve removing SCP-1703 from its container require approval from the Site Director.

**Description:** SCP-1703 is similar in appearance to a lit 60W incandescent light bulb. It was recovered from the wreckage of ██████ Cold Springs Fitness Centre following Incident 1703-1. An employee of the club that was absent during Incident 1703-1 reported that the object was already noted among the staff for being apparently impossible to turn off, but this was attributed to faulty wiring rather than any anomalous properties. Due to the object being located in a high-traffic area, a decision was made to leave it alone until it burned out.

Despite its appearance, SCP-1703 is not a light bulb at all as it seems to lack any visible filament. Access to electricity has no observable effect on its function. The source of its glow is a walnut-shaped core which has been determined to emit small amounts of radiation across the whole electromagnetic spectrum, the strongest being in the visible light range. SCP-1703 weighs exactly as much as an ordinary light bulb of its size without filament. Little else is known about it at this time as it is difficult to determine the core's features and composition without destructive testing. //Site Director's note: Attempts to remove the core from inside its hull are expressly prohibited at this time.//

SCP-1703's anomalous effect acts on most solid and opaque objects illuminated directly by its visible light for at least 3 minutes and 17 seconds; materials transparent to visible light seem to be immune. Affected objects undergo a 2-week period within which they will lose up to 20% of their weight, despite not actually losing any mass. Approx. once every six months, SCP-1703's glow rapidly intensifies into a brief, intense flash. All objects caught in the flash that were previously affected by SCP-1703 appear to become inversely affected by gravity -- they "fall upwards", accelerating and reaching terminal velocity as a regular object of a similar mass would in free-fall. Due to being repelled by all gravitational fields, such objects eventually leave Earth's atmosphere and the Solar System.

SCP-1703 is completely immune to its own effect.

Cold Springs Fitness Centre is located 3km east of ███████, ██████. It is approximately 500m away from the main road, surrounded by trees. Despite its relatively remote location, the club enjoyed a recent surge of popularity due to its privacy and word-of-mouth rumors that exercising there was highly effective for weight loss. 

Initial readings show trace amounts of radiation around the site. The air is slightly cleaner than in the immediate surrounding areas.

Numerous trees are missing from around the club, leaving behind disturbed earth associated with uprooting. Some rotten oaks display broad fissures of material ripped from them, and some are pushed around the recently-expanded parking lot by wind, apparently reversed only partially. Pavement in the parking lot has been torn off in strips with rough edges, on which the outermost fragments of the pavement stick up and outwards. Areas of destruction outside the club are consistent with the positions of windows, and SCP-1703's projected radiation through those windows from where it was originally installed as a light fixture. The destruction radius extends to approximately 82 meters from the object, although its electromagnetic radiation stays visible and coherent over much longer distances. A circle can be drawn around the incident location, connecting the farthest points of SCP-1703's effect.

Most of the club's ceiling is missing. Intact beams show signs of metal fatigue, suggesting that the ceiling quickly "sagged" upwards, and then was torn out. Walls are partially destroyed; those that previously had some object obscuring them from a direct line of sight with SCP-1703 remain intact. Interestingly, while some windows have shattered from the physical forces following weight reversal of the surrounding architecture, they are all present and have not been affected by SCP-1703.

The majority of the club's training equipment is also missing. A few devices "hang off" exposed beams and support structures that prevent them from "falling" into the sky. These are identified as being the most significant sources of residual gamma-radiation in the area.

The staff cafeteria is the only room on the main floor surviving for the most part. The ceiling is dotted with cutlery lodged within it, and the table itself "lies" nearby on its side, close to the upper edge of the far wall. Glasses and drinks are broken and spilled over the floor. Non-transparent dishes, broken or intact, are affixed to the ceiling. Similarly, all objects on the ceiling contain traces of gamma radiation.

The front door -- made of glass -- appeared to have been deformed during structural shocks such that it became impossible to open. An approx. 30cm x 50cm hole in the door has been made by an object thrown from the inside, as indicated by broken glass lying outside. Pieces of clothing, tissue, and blood trailing upwards from the hole appear to indicate that someone attempted to leave the already partially destroyed building through it.

No survivors have been found. ██ persons were detected in Earth's upper stratosphere gradually accelerating away from the planet, accounting for 86% of the attending club members and staff. The only creature, living or otherwise, recovered from the incident site was a dog that had been tied outside the front door, identified as belonging to a regular at the club. It was kept earth-bound, and was eventually strangled, by its leash.
