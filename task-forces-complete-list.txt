title:A Comprehensive List of Mobile Task Forces
**Disclaimer:** If this document confuses and scares you, and you don't understand what it is, read [[[task-forces|this guide]]] until you feel better.

The following list is //not// to be considered a canonical record of Mobile Task Forces within the Foundation universe. It is intended as a tool for writers, and is not considered 'official' by any stretch of the imagination.

If you spot an MTF that's not on this list, or create a new one for your own SCP article or tale, feel free to insert it[[footnote]]Wait to make sure your article's staying in the positive ratings (remaining at +1 or above for 24 hours) before adding the Task Force here: it's a pain to go through and clean up afterwards.[[/footnote]]. If the number is already taken, just add a new entry below the original. Likewise, if you spot an MTF in this list that's no longer in existence, or goes by a different name/number, feel free to delete/edit it! This is primarily a collaborative project, so any additional help would be greatly appreciated. The formatting for adding a new item to the list is as follows:

> = **{{@@|| MTF number@@[[footnote]]If applicable, have a link here to the specific entry on the [[[task-forces|canon list]]].[[/footnote]]@@ || Codename/alias || Works it's used in@@[[footnote]]For 'canon' task forces, or those with individual hub pages, just include a link. Hubs take priority over the [[[task-forces|canon list]]].[[/footnote]]@@ || Brief description of its purpose, goals, and current situation@@[[footnote]]Feel free to write whatever here if it's your MTF, but try to keep it fairly unobjectionable if it's not. It's not mandatory, but something more detailed than "SCP-specific Task Force" would be nice![[/footnote]]@@ ||@@}}**

Entries marked with a '•' have been fully verified, and are confirmed to be accurate and up-to-date (or rather, as up-to-date as I can manage). Other stuff should be fine as well, but make sure to check first,  and please don't verify your own entries!

++ LIST OF TYPES OF TASK FORCES:

[[collapsible show="► Show list" hide="◄ Hide list"]]

||~ Type ||~ Abbreviation ||~ Details ||~ Example ||
|| Mobile Task Force || MTF || The standard designation, any team of people that moves from place to place can technically be given the title MTF. || MTF Alpha-1 ("[[[tanhony-s-proposal|Red Right Hand]]]") ||
|| Stationary Task Force || STF || What's that? Your team doesn't move? Use an STF name instead -- if they're sitting in offices managing things, a Stationary Task Force sounds right up your alley. || STF Beta-8 ("[[[SCP-3490|Bubble Blowers]]]") ||
|| Naval Task Force ||  NTF || If your team mucks about on the ocean blue, chances are they're a Naval Task Force. || NTF Delta-7 ("[[[SCP-3700|Northern Storm]]]") ||
|| Provisional Task Force || PTF || Any task force formed to counter a single threat or incident. If they're only going to be used one time, Provisional is what you're looking for. || PTF Duplic-4 ("[[[scp-4029|Inner Workings]]]") ||
|| Research Task Force || RTF || More boffins than brawlers, a Research Task Force specialises in investigating either a single anomaly, suspected anomaly, or type of anomaly. As with NTF and PTF, they can be used interchangeably with MTF. ||  RTF Sigel-9 ("[[[SCP-3676|Oregon Trailblazers]]]") ||
|| Special Task Force || STF || An esoteric, particular, or otherwise abnormal task force. Beyond that, what they are is up to you. || STF-Omega-15 ("[[[SCP-2487|Dire Deeds]]]") ||
|| Orbital Task Force || OTF || A task force. In space! If it's involved in orbits or space-stations, it's an OTF. || OTF ग-3 ("[[[first55|Cochrane's Children]]]") ||
|| Joint Task Force || JTF || When the Foundation forms a group with members of other organisations, a JTF is what they make. || JTF Delta-3 ("[[[the-blackbird-and-the-falcon|Organic Free Trade]]]") ||
|| Distributed Task Force || DTF || Multiple divisions, big or small, grouped under a single banner. This is the designation for you if they're tackling many things at once. || DTF Sigma-6 ("[[[scp-120|Puddlejumpers]]]") ||
|| Task Force || TF || All-encompassing designation for all types of Task Force. If you're not sure, just use this. || TF-Theta-8 ("[[[scp-2791|Invisible Hand]]]") ||
|| Applied Task Force || ATF || Somewhat a hybrid between a provisional and stationary task force.  Created for the purpose of containing a single anomaly, but not temporary. Don't travel and aren't ever reassigned. || ATF Indianapolis-13 ("[[[djkaktus-s-proposal-ii|Killboys"]]]) ||
|| Collaborative Task Force || CTF || A task force that works directly in conjunction with other task forces or GoIs. || CTF-Psi-12 ("[[[SCP-2906|Madvillainy]]]") ||
|| Cryptography Task Force || CTF || A task force designed to keep communication secure or tracking the output of information. || CTF-4753-06  [[[[SCP-4753| DATA MISSING]]]] ||
|| Oceanic Task Force || OTF || Like Naval Task Forces, Oceanic Task Forces deal with activities on the sea.|| OTF Delta-7 ("[[[SCP-4778|Bay-Watchers]]]") ||

Many thanks to [[*user Crayne]], who provided the basis for this using arcane computer majix, and [[*user Modern_Erasmus]], who put in a frankly ridiculous amount of work getting this project off the ground. This list is currently run primarily by [[*user MaliceAforethought]] -- contact him if you have any list-related questions, queries, or concerns.
