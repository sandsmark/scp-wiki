**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5888 is to be housed in a standard humanoid living quarters at Site-19 and is permitted to socialize with other personnel and residents as desired.

Any SCP-5888-1 instances generated by SCP-5888 are to be documented and backed up digitally; all interviews with SCP-5888 are to be recorded, transcribed, and stored with this file. Should an instance not demanifest, it is to be stored in a designated locker at Site-19.

**Description:** SCP-5888 is an elderly humanoid male whose physical appearance suggests his age to be in his late seventies. The subject is believed to actually be far older, due in part to his anomalously negligible biological aging.

SCP-5888’s primary anomalous quality is his ability to reproduce any form of informational media that he had previously observed or experienced firsthand. These objects are collectively designated SCP-5888-1 and individually designated as //Items// within this file for brevity's sake. This ability is aided by SCP-5888’s proclaimed photographic memory. SCP-5888-1 instances will take on a variety of forms depending on the date during which they were initially experienced by SCP-5888, typically appearing as the form of media viewed or otherwise relevant at the time.

Despite the accuracy of details recorded in these memories, SCP-5888 is unable to mentally recall long-term memories traditionally and must resort to the creation of these instances to recall such information. By coming into and sustaining contact with the instances, SCP-5888 is able to recall memories or information initially associated with that instance. SCP-5888-1 instances remain inert upon contact with individuals other than SCP-5888.

SCP-5888-1 instances are generated through SCP-5888’s skin, where the flesh on the desired portion of SCP-5888’s body will part and reveal a dark void inside of SCP-5888’s body from which the instance will emerge; once retrieved, the opening will close. This process generally does not cause harm or discomfort to SCP-5888. Instances will usually demanifest a few minutes after their production unless intentionally retained by SCP-5888.

SCP-5888 has proven cooperative with Foundation personnel in terms of containment and interviewing, providing instances to personnel and manifesting relevant information upon request.

**Discovery:** SCP-5888 first came to the Foundation’s attention in September of 1995 after reports of an elderly man who was able to produce items from his skin began circulating near Tashkent, Uzbekistan. On 11/4/95, agents located a man in that area matching the descriptions in the rumors; the man was declared anomalous and brought into Foundation custody without resistance. SCP-5888 proved cooperative with personnel during and after his transfer to Site-19, despite being initially hesitant.

**Addendum 5888.1:** The following is an abridged detailing of several notable SCP-5888-1 instances created by SCP-5888.

[[tab Item-15]]

[[include :scp-sandbox-3:image-zoom name=http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/ids-flesh/tablet.jpg|caption=Item-15 upon manifestation.|width=250px|align=right]]

**Specimen Description:** A cuneiform-inscribed clay tablet.

**Date of Memory:** Roughly 2000 B.C.

**Content:** A military order to attack a city named “Saatiae” with a force of three thousand soldiers. The entity or kingdom that would have issued this order remains unidentified, and no city by the name of “Saatiae” is known to have existed at any point in known history.

**Comments made by SCP-5888:** //Innocent blood was spilt that day for little reason more than money and political squabbling. A shame that things have changed very little since then.//
[[/tab]]

[[tab Item-21]]
**Specimen Description:** An old piece of paper, yellowed with age.

**Date of Memory:** Late eighteenth century.

**Content:** A letter written in French detailing an execution order for several members of the French nobility alive before and up to the French Revolution. A small red stain is present on the letter’s surface.

**Comments made by SCP-5888:** //Violence, and war by extension, is not itself bad, it is simply evil or good depending on the purpose for which it is used; sadly more often than not, it is used for evil. However, when the Revolution broke out, all men trembled: the poor with anticipation, knowing what was to come; and the rich with fear, knowing what they had caused. The day the doors to the Bastille flew open, a just fight was begun, and its combatants were sure to deliver for even centuries afterward.//

[[tab Item-29]]

[[include :scp-sandbox-3:image-zoom name=http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/ids-flesh/book.jpg|caption=Imagery contained within Item-29.|align=right]]

**Specimen Description:** A bound manuscript.

**Date of Memory:** European Medieval period.

**Content:** An assortment of hymns, prayers, and various depictions of scenes from the New Testament, as well as several additional scenes of figures performing unidentified rituals. The later pages of the book contain illegible scribbles and symbols, Latin characters, and crude drawings of smiling stick figures grouped together.

**Comments made by SCP-5888:** //All societies have outcasts in one form or another, and oftentimes those outcasts will come together to form a society of their own. The worries, fears, anxieties of isolation truly are unhealthy, no matter the era in which one resides. One common factor across the ages is the power of a community to strengthen its members and let them find meaning, and in this case, belonging amidst a world that had cast them out.//
[[/tab]]

[[tab Item-38]]
**Specimen Description:** A small painting.

**Date of Memory:** Renaissance Era.

**Content:** The painting depicts a scene highly similar to Thomas Cole’s //The Savage State// (1834), though differs in its inclusion of a group of pale, slender figures in the foreground, each holding unknown equipment, possibly weapons or tools of sorts.

**Comments made by SCP-5888:** //Masaccio[[footnote]]A lesser-known painter from the European High Renaissance who died in 1428.[[/footnote]] always had a flare for the unknown; eventually his curiosity led him down a path few have ever walked, and he found those who were beyond his wildest comprehension, and it was the most beautiful thing he'd ever laid his eyes upon. He sought his desires, his aspirations, and was greatly rewarded for his courage. After an encounter like that I’d expect nothing less of him than to reference that beauty in his work.//
[[/tab]]

[[tab Item-51]]
**Specimen Description:** A hinged silver locket with a necklace chain.

**Date of Memory:** Early twentieth century, likely during the first World War.

**Content:** A small portrait photograph depicting a smiling young woman is present. The photograph is slightly discolored with age, and shallow gash is present on the outside of the locket.

**Comments made by SCP-5888:** //I’ve seen more carnage than most, but those trenches… my God. There was evil in that place. Had it been the madmen that created the gas, the men commanding its use, or [[[the-young-man|something darker]]], I cannot be sure. But when I couldn’t stand to fight any longer, the thought of her gave me the drive, the hope I needed to press on.//[[footnote]]The subject declined to answer further questions regarding the woman photographed, and SCP-5888 was not found with any other individuals at the time of discovery.[[/footnote]]
[[/tab]]


[[tab Item-59]]
**Specimen Description:** A Polaroid photograph.

**Date of Memory:** August 9th, 1980

**Content:** The photograph depicts a smiling, elderly woman from the side. She is leaning against a stone guardrail, overlooking a small city below believed to be Edinburgh, Scotland. A message written in pen is present on the back of the Item, which reads "My fate, my love, forever. -8/9/1980."

**Comments made by SCP-5888:** //Loss is an unfortunately inevitable part in life, that's just the way it is; the grief and mourning that follow it are inherent parts of the process. But to allow the two to consume you is to throw away all the lessons that the dead had taught you in life. To focus on the pain instead of the renewal is among the worst mistakes you can make. Moira taught me this, and though it took me a long time to accept it, she was completely right. The past may be said and done, but there are lessons to be learnt, or at the very least memories to be treasured, and not even time can erase those.//[[footnote]]Possible connections between SCP-5888's mention here and the the photograph contained within Item-51 have been considered, though SCP-5888 has declined to comment further on the matter.[[/footnote]]

__**Interview Video Log Transcript**__

**Interviewer:** Researcher Griffin

**Subject:** SCP-5888

**Foreword:** The purpose of this interview was to ascertain the approximate age of SCP-5888 by recording an example of one of his earliest memories. To this end, SCP-5888 was prompted to produce an SCP-5888-1 instance corresponding to such a memory. The following is what transpired.

-----

**[BEGIN LOG]**

(//SCP-5888 holds out his right hand and closes his eyes. After roughly one minute, he can be seen visibly straining himself trying manifest the target SCP-5888-1 instance, eventually grunting with effort. Following another 30 seconds, the skin of his palm parts, produces a small oblong stone carved with runic imagery[[footnote]]Later designated Item-91.[[/footnote]], and closes. SCP-5888 opens his eyes and breathes deeply while running his fingers over the stone.//)

**SCP-5888:** (//Whispering.//) That's right...

**Griffin:** That took much longer than usual. How long ago would say this memory dates back to?

**SCP-5888:** This was thousands... no, //tens of// thousands of years, at least. (//He slowly thumbs object's surface.//)

**Griffin:** Tens of thousands of years? What could have happened that long ago?

**SCP-5888:** (//Glances up to the camera and mumbles.//) You're cleared to know about them, aren't you?

**Griffin:** Sorry, I don't see how my security clearance is pertinent to this conversation.

**SCP-5888:** (//Shrugs.//) I think you already know what happened all those millennia ago. (//He turns Item-91 over in his hands and rubs its edge with his finger.//) That bloody day.

**Griffin:** (//Looks perplexedly at SCP-5888.//) I'm not sure I follow.

**SCP-5888:** (//Leans in and whispers.//) [[[SCP-1000|The Day of the Flowers]]].

**Griffin:** (//His eyes widen, and he quickly turns around towards the camera.//) Everyone in the viewing room without Level 3 clearance or higher, out. Now.

(//Griffin turns back to SCP-5888 and allows a moment for his assistants to exit the viewing room before continuing.//)

**Griffin:** You were there?

**SCP-5888:** (//Nods.//) Humanity had always hovered around the edges of the ancient cities, almost like primitive fairies in the woods, ever-aware of the superiority of the Children of the Night, but curious of them nonetheless. The Children were similarly interested, they watched the humans with their torches and sticks like a driver watches a doe on the side of the road. Humans thrived in their natural state and the Children thrived in theirs. Well, for the first couple ages, at least.

**Griffin:** I've read the files. There's not much we know about SCP-1000 prior to that Day, but from what we've gathered they were considerably advanced, no?

**SCP-5888:** Shining, webbed supercities, breathing engines that ran on light, and weapons beyond comprehension. (//He smiles.//) 'Considerably advanced' is a gross understatement. Rest assured, they were mortal but they were akin to gods with their technology.

**Griffin:** I assumed as much. But how did the primitive humans manage to not only access this technology you've described, but go as far as to wipe out the tech's creators?

**SCP-5888:** Despite my, uh, //proximity// to the proceedings of the event, I'm still not entirely certain what led to mankind coming into possession of those weapons. Maybe it was a small slip up or a mischievous little god looking to start some trouble. Whatever it was, the result was horrendous all the same.  

**Griffin:** Proximity? Were you enlisted on the humans' side?

**SCP-5888:** (//Rolls his eyes.//) We both know I'm hardly human, especially where it counts for your Foundation. I just happened to be there when it all went down.

**Griffin:** (//Nods.//) Fair enough. But what was it like when it did //go down//?

(//He remains silent and turns over the stone in his hands, feeling the grooves with his fingertips, and shudders.//)

**SCP-5888:** //Cataclysmic//. Oceans simply burned into nothing, continents plunged into the seas, entire mountain ranges sundered, and every flower on the planet bloomed in the brilliant sun as the Children were slaughtered in their sleep. Their shining cities burned, their living machines choked, and even their very minds were shattered by the more twisted contraptions humanity had acquired. In the end, humanity reigned victorious, as if it were even a fair fight, having wiped an entire civilization-- as well as several continents-- right off the face of the planet. All within a single day.
 
**Griffin:** Entire continents? Weaponry like that isn't even //theoretical// yet, maybe imaginable at best.

**SCP-5888:** Imagination was more than enough to blow apart the world that day.

**Griffin:** (//Mumbling to himself.//) Pataphysics perhaps?

**SCP-5888:** Trust me, its best for this world that those weapons never come to be again. There's a reason those things are, and should remain only imaginable.

**Griffin:** I'm sorry, you just piqued my interest a bit, but I understand where you're coming from. Pardon my interruption, please go on.

**SCP-5888:** When the euphoria of victory had faded and the dust had settled, humanity gazed upon the shattered world they had wrought by their own hands and realized the magnitude of what they had done.

**Griffin:** (//Nods.//) The wipe. Details are foggy at best, but the primitive humans wiped the Day from their own minds due to the guilt, right?

**SCP-5888:** Few men could live with the knowledge that they had had a hand in the most terrible atrocity in history. Those few that could carried in their minds the the secret to humanity's global success: genocide.

**Griffin:** And humanity prospered.

**SCP-5888:** (//Nods.//) Without the limitations of trying to function and work around the presence of a super-society, humanity naturally flourished and developed to where it is today, give or take some some bumps and snags they hit along the way.

**Griffin:** (//Remains silent for a moment.//) I knew the Day of the Flowers was inherently rooted in violence, but... my God.

**SCP-5888:** I should mention that their weapons that break the mind and cripple the soul, as potent as the were, should be wearing off by now. (//He pauses thoughtfully for a moment.//) They've tried making contact, haven't they?

**Griffin:** (//Hesitantly.//) Yes, there have been a handful of documented cases of attempted contact.

**SCP-5888:** I figured it'd be something along those lines. There's really no telling how it'll turn out though, right? After all, I'm here to tell you the past, not the future.

**Griffin:** (//Gathering his papers.//) Yeah... well, um, thank you for your time. I'll send a guard in to escort you back to the living quarters in a second.

**SCP-5888:** Anytime. (//He rises from his chair and walks to the window, staring out over Site-19's main courtyard.//) Mr. Griffin, I'd just like to remind you: the best teacher you can learn from is history, and as the classic saying goes, those who don't learn from history...

**Griffin:** (//Quietly.//) ...are doomed to repeat it.

(//SCP-5888 smiles lightly and bows his head towards Griffin, who nods politely and exits the room.//)
