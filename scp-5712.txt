[[size 120%]]**Special Containment Procedures:**[[/size]]

SCP-5712 cannot be contained. As such, containment of SCP-5712 primarily involves impeding its development. STF σ-14 ("Wordsmiths") has been assigned to develop fictional lexemes[[footnote]]Ideatic unit representing an item within the confines of a language, analogous to a linguistic meme.[[/footnote]] for the purpose of impeding SCP-5712's development.

Any individuals associated with SCP-5712 that spontaneously loses either their name or concept of self without prior exposure to other known nomenclative hazards are to be immediately neutralized to prevent SCP-5712 from appending their retained information to itself. 

SCP-5712-B is currently the subject of an active recovery and neutralization effort by MTF γ-1 ("Search and Destroy").

SCP-5712's activity within the noosphere[[footnote]]The collective of information shared by all human consciousnesses.[[/footnote]] and infosphere[[footnote]]The collective of all information. Subsumes the noosphere and eclipses it in size to an incalculable degree.[[/footnote]] is to be monitored and directed via examination of words produced by SCP-5712-A. Any significant nomenclative divergence in word association games played by SCP-5712-A is to be reported to the item's acting Lead Researcher, currently Dr. Alistair Dankworth.

Personnel monitoring games played by instances of SCP-5712-A are to regularly undergo psychological evaluation. Assigned personnel are to be amnesticized immediately should they display any of the following:

* Inability to recall the rules of word association games played by SCP-5712-A
* Symptoms typical of exposure to anti-ideatic anomalies
* Knowledge regarding GoI-005 ("**Fifth**ism")

Should SCP-5712-A cease transmitting new words for any reason, including winning or losing its word association game, SCP-5712 is to be reclassified as neutralized.

Should SCP-5712-A begin displaying concepts associated with the Foundation, SCP-5712-B is to be exorcised by an ordained Catholic priest and completely submerged in sulfuric acid until dissolved.

[[size 120%]]**Description:**[[/size]]

SCP-5712 is a metastatic meme complex[[footnote]]Often referred to as "ideatic cancer", metastatic meme complexes are essentially overgrown predatory ideas. While the vast majority of memes develop through transmission and evolution, a metastatic meme develops through appension, a process during which the meme will completely absorb an idea and append its retained ideatic mass to itself. Eventually, a metastatic meme will consist mostly of absorbed concepts, to the point where the original meme is unidentifiable. It is at this point that it is considered a complex. (Calloway, A. G., Marness, L. P. (n.d.). //A Comprehensive Guide to Ideatic Anomalies// (2nd ed., Vol. 2, Ser. 1). Foundation Research Press.) [[/footnote]] currently occupying 
the linguistic aspect of the noosphere. SCP-5712 develops through the subsumption of English lexemes humanly associated with concepts already appended to its ideatic mass. The process by which SCP-5712 associates concepts can be controlled through interactions with SCP-5712 in the form of word association games.

SCP-5712-A is the Foundation supercomputer //Peirce//, constructed in ████ for the purpose of analyzing ideatic and conceptual anomalies within the noosphere. SCP-5712-A's anomalous properties demanifested following the disappearance of SCP-5712-B (See **Addendum V**).

SCP-5712-B is an experimental thaumaturgical component infused with the Tartarean entity commonly referred to as Belial (TE-0068). SCP-5712-B formerly manifested within SCP-5712-A due to thaumaturgic processes conducted by Dr. Nadia Amari.

The following is an excerpt of the project proposal for Project BELIAL, a collaborative effort by several independent Foundation departments to construct SCP-5712-B by infusing Tartarean entity TE-0068 into a thaumaturgical processor compatible with Foundation supercomputer //Peirce//.

**Abstract:**
Foundation supercomputer //Peirce// has proven itself to be incredibly effective at exploring the noosphere. However, //Peirce//'s usefulness is significantly limited due to its inability to identify antimemes, which are inherently incompatible with human consciousness and only exist within the larger infosphere. Through the application of a thaumaturgical component infused with TE-0068, //Peirce//'s reception can exceed the entirety of human perception, enabling it to percieve antimemetic anomalies in the infosphere.

**Utilization:**
The BELIAL component is in essence an amplifying component for //Peirce//. The actual development involves complex thaumaturgical procedures, including the binding of the massive Type I Tartarean entity TE-0068. The aforementioned entity was selected due to its affinity for ideatic manipulation, which is attributed to a direct connection to the infosphere.

(//Amari is kneeling before a large sigil drawn on the floor in chalk. Dankworth stands behind her, holding the BELIAL component.//)

**Dankworth:** Why exactly do we need to //summon a demon// for this?

(//Amari sighs.//)

**Amari:** For the last time, we call them //Tartarean entities.//

**Dankworth:** Sure, whatever. I'm just...apprehensive. I mean, it sounds as thought we're adding yet another uncontrollable factor to an already unstable system.

(//Amari turns to face Dankworth.//)

**Amari:** Memetics is your field of expertise. I'm just here to bind Belial to that —

(//Amari waves towards the component.//)

(//Silence.//)

**Amari:** Anyways, I'm going to need you to step away from the sigil.

(//Dankworth looks downward and takes a few steps back.//)

**Amari:** Alright.

(//Amari takes a deep breath and turns around, closing her eyes.//)

**Amari:** (//Unintelligible//)

(//Nearby Tartarean Resonance Energy sensors begin indicating high TRE levels in the vicinity. A tall humanoid of Caucasian appearance manifests in the center of the sigil.//)

(//Amari opens her eyes. TE-0068 studies its form before facing Amari.//)

**TE-0068:** Nadia, wasn't it? I haven't seen you in yonks —

(//Amari rolls her eyes.//)

**TE-0068:** What, too busy nowadays to chat with your old mate Belial?

(//TE-0068 glances at Dankworth.//)

**TE-0068:** (//Nodding towards Dankworth//) And who's the new chap over there?

(//Dankworth blinks.//)

**Amari:** None of your concern, //Matanbuchus//[[footnote]]Enochian sobriquet for TE-0068, meaning "worthless".[[/footnote]].

(//TE-0068 feigns insult.//)

**TE-0068:** Why ring me up in the first place if you think me so useless?

(//Amari ignores TE-0068, and turns to face Dankworth.//)

**Amari:** Alistair, do you mind bringing the thing over here?

(//Dankworth slowly approaches the circle.//)

(//TE-0068 raises an eyebrow.//)

**TE-0068:** Alistair, is it? Pleasure to make your acquaintance.

(//TE-0068 smiles, extending a hand towards Dankworth.//)

(//Dankworth looks at Amari, who shakes her head.//)

**TE-0068:** Well, go on, shake my hand!

**Amari:** (//Quietly//) Back away from the sigil.

(//Dankworth nods and slowly backs away. TE-0068 frowns.//)

**TE-0068:** Mhm. Worth a shot, I suppose.

(//TE-0068 winks at Dankworth, then sits down directly in front of Amari.//)

**TE-0068:** So what's the matter this time? Not more family issues, is it? Or perhaps —

**Amari:** Enough. This —

(//Amari picks up the BELIAL component.//)

**TE-0068:** What about it? 

**Amari:** Bind.

**TE-0068:** (//Looking around the room//) I'm sorry, were you talking to me?

**Amari:** //Bind.//

(//Amari gently slides the component into the circle. TE-0068 picks it up and inspects it thoroughly.//)

**TE-0068:** That's awfully small, isn't it? Not really my cup of tea —

(//Amari nods towards the component.//)

(//TE-0068 sighs.//)

**TE-0068:** Oh, alright, then.

(//TE-0068 instantly disappears. The BELIAL component falls to the floor.//)

(//Silence.//)

(//Dankworth glances at the component.//)

**Dankworth:** So...we're done here?

(//Amari turns back towards the BELIAL component.//)

**Amari:** Yeah.

(//Amari stands up and collects the component, handing it to Dankworth.//)

**Amari:** Let me know if there's any trouble.

//Dr. Alistair Dankworth//
[[/>]]

-----

**Overview:**
Following complete diagnostics of all correlated systems, it has been confirmed that Foundation supercomputer //Peirce// is currently the subject of a memetic anomaly, tentatively designated SCP-5712. Redesignation of //Peirce// from Thaumiel pending.

**Notes:**
Never before have we seen beyond the limits of human consciousness — with good reason, it should seem. SCP-5712 (which [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3125 may or may not be the only one of its kind]) appears to be a predatory meme that devours other concepts. What actually occurs to its prey is uncertain, but in all known cases thus far, subsumed concepts effectively develop antimemetic properties and are either erased or replaced within the noosphere. I suspect they are absorbed into the mass of SCP-5712.

The infosphere is a hostile environment that we feeble humans should never have sought out. But only now can we see through an open window, and the waters of this ocean of ideas are flooding our submarine. — Dr. Alistair Dankworth

[[size 110%]]//Transmission Log//[[/size]]

Following Incident 5712-001, a complete diagnostic of the //Peirce// systems recovered no malfunctions, excluding the BELIAL component, which, while still emitting noticeable levels of Tartarean Resonance Energy, no longer contained TE-0068. Analysis of the ideatic composition of TE-0068 revealed that TE-0068 as a concept had been subsumed by SCP-5712.

-----
**Item #:** SCP-5712

**Current Object Class:** Thaumiel

**Head Researcher:** Dr. Alistair Dankworth

**Overview:** No matter how you frame it, SCP-5712 is currently uncontained. The best we can do right now is try to slow it down, and even then, its complete subsumption of all concepts is inevitable. The fact of the matter is, we are fighting a losing battle; Murasaki.aic has already had to resort to several high-risk, compromising maneuvers to limit the transmission of SCP-5712.

Furthermore, the effects of //every// transmission of SCP-5712, whether beneficial in the long term or not, has to be dealt with by the Disinformation Bureau. During my inquiry with the regional Disinformation Bureau liaison, Xavier Solera, he sent me the following list of recent Disinformation Bureau operations regarding SCP-5712:

> * Officially renaming the Arab Republic of **Egypt**
> * Replacing all copyright records of **jelly** with **preserve**
> * Unofficially aiding multiple billion-dollar restaurant franchises in rebranding their primary product, the **hamburger**
> * Redefining geography, mathematics, and physics terminology associated with **axis**
> * Redefining geography, mathematics, and physics terminology associated with **projection**
> * Developing an alternative American history without the existence of Abraham **Lincoln**
> * Administering mnestics to all Foundation personnel to ever have worked on GoI-005 ("**Fifth**ism")

In conclusion, the impacts of SCP-5712 correspond with that of an uncontained anomaly, and as of writing, no effective containment procedures have been developed. As such, I am officially requesting a Keter-classification for SCP-5712 with a strong recommendation for decommissioning if at all possible.

**Item #:** SCP-5712

**Object Class:** --Thaumiel-- Redesignation Pending

**Supporting Personnel:**
* //Dr. Nadia Amari representing Occult Studies Division//
* //Jacqueline Sydney representing Classification Committee//
* //Xavier Solera representing Disinformation Bureau//

**Please check off or fill in the applicable boxes regarding the reasons for submitting your proposal:**
☑ Excessive Risk of Lifted Veil Scenario
☐ Excessive Danger
☐ Expense
☐ Ethical Concern
☐ Legal Concern
☐ Potential to Decommission Apollyon-Class Object
☐ High Risk of K-Class Scenario (if so, please state which type(s)):
☑ Other (please state): Invasive anomaly under TYR Protocol[[footnote]]A preemptive executive order by the O5 Council that invasive anomalies originating externally to the Earth ought to be prevented from fully manifesting within the Earth if at all possible.[[/footnote]] and theoretically uncontainable without neutralization.

**Summary:** Containment of SCP-5712 is unsustainable. Assuming continuation of current containment procedures, Murasaki.aic estimates that SCP-5712 will subsume 100% of the noosphere within 12 years, resulting in unknown and likely undesirable memetic effects. Furthermore, SCP-5712 has already demonstrated considerable likelihood in resulting in a Lifted Veil scenario due to difficulty of proliferating disinformation regarding SCP-5712. Lastly, SCP-5712 has been officially designated an invasive anomaly, technically justifying neutralization under TYR Protocol. All things considered, it is in the best interests of the Foundation to decommission SCP-5712.

[BEGIN LOG]

**Amari:** I'm still don't see how exorcising TE-0068 will solve this whole issue.

**Dankworth:** Because that's SCP-5712's only access into the noosphere. We're hoping that severing SCP-5712's connection to the human headspace will quite literally sever it — rendering it almost like a useless limb.

**Amari:** Sure. But how do you know it won't just grow back, like a — a severed starfish arm?

(//Dankworth pauses.//)

**Dankworth:** Well, at least we'll be able to observe the regeneration's behavior within the noosphere.

**Amari:** But it's not a complete solution, is it?

(//Silence.//)

(//A lab assistant enters the area, carrying a large container.//)

**Dankworth:** (//To lab assistant//) Be careful with that!

**Lab Assistant:** Where do you want it?

**Dankworth:** Just as far away from //Peirce// as you can, please.

(//Amari watches the lab assistant place the container against the wall.//)

**Amari:** You sure this stuff can dissolve the  component?

**Dankworth:** Don't worry about it. Just do your job and deal with the demon —

**Amari** //Tartarean entity// —

**Dankworth:** — yes, that. Just do your job, and I'll do mine.

(//Amari sighs and kneels on the floor in front of the BEILAL component's housing unit.//)

(//Dankworth nods towards the lab assistant, who opens the unit. Local TRE levels spike.//)

(//Dankworth shifts uneasily.//)

**Amari:** If you're not comfortable, you don't have to be here.

**Dankworth:** No, it's — it's fine. You can carry onward.

(//Lab assistant removes the BELIAL component using a set of tongs and places it directly before Amari.//)

**Amari:** (//Unintelligible//)

(//Lab assistant exits, briefly turning back before continuing to leave.//)

(//A dark tendril extends from the BELIAL component. Incomprehensible whispers emanate from the component's general vicinity.//)

**Amari:** No snarky comments this time?

(//TE-0068 approaches Amari and comes into full view of the camera, appearing to be composed of a torn fabric of shadow-like composition.//)

**Amari:** (//Quietly//) What the hell?

**TE-0068:** I am become — become? 

(//TE-0068 mutters to itself.//)

**TE-0068:** Yes, the bottom feeder. It absorbed me into itself.

(//TE-0068's form flows freely while suspended in midair.//)

**TE-0068:** It feeds — it feeds and I am become one —

**TE-0068:** I am? No, not I — I am not.

(//TE-0068 pauses.//)

(//Amari stares at TE-0068's shifting form.//)

**Dankworth:** (//Quietly//) Amari?

(//Amari blinks, then refocuses.//)

**Amari:** Right — right.

(//Amari closes her eyes and begins whispering while holding her hands over the BELIAL component.//)

(//TE-0068 does not appear to be affected.//)

(//Amari closes her eyes and begins whispering again, this time holding the BELIAL component.//)

(//TE-0068 flows back towards the BELIAL component and begins condensing, before ceasing all movement.//)

(//Amari turns to face Dankworth.//)

**Amari:** I can feel it, and I'm pulling on it, but it isn't coming out — like it's stuck, or something.

(//Dankworth furrows his brow.//)

**Dankworth:** Can you pull harder?

(//Amari shakes her head.//)

**Amari:** It's hard enough just holding on.

(//Dankworth closes his eyes, turning away.//)

**TE-0068:** I am not — I am it. //It// is. It consumes.

(//Amari turns to face the BELIAL component.//)

(//TE-0068's form rearranges into that of an abstract memetic hazard.//

Following this, SCP-5712's designation has been officially upgraded to Keter. A contingent of Foundation semioticians and linguists have been organized and officially established as STF σ-14 ("Wordsmiths") to deter the development of SCP-5712 through the creation of superfluous lexemes for feeding purposes.

Although Foundation supercomputer //Peirce// no longer displays any anomalous properties, it is still referred to as SCP-5712-A in relevant documentation for archival purposes.

As of writing, neither SCP-5712-B nor Dr. Nadia Amari have been recovered.

We were fishing in dangerous waters. Should've known we might end up baiting a shark, but Amari kept pulling, until she pulled it out of the water.

And for a brief moment, I saw [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-5880 the other side] —  the infosphere.

SCP-5712 is barely the tip of the iceberg. Belial called it a "bottom feeder", and they weren't lying. It might be a shark to us, but compared to the things on the other side, it's less than nothing. It just happened to be the first one we let in.

Now the real sharks know the way in. And they smell blood.
