**Item #:** SCP-794

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** The area in a 20km radius surrounding SCP-794 has been designated as a no-fly zone and all unauthorized personnel attempting to enter the area are to be detained for questioning. Unauthorized aircraft attempting to enter the airspace around SCP-794 are to be signalled off immediately, and any that fail to follow instructions are to be intercepted and detained at Containment Site 794-Alpha.

Personnel may only approach within the 1400 m "Red Zone" of SCP-794 with prior permission from at least two (2) Level 4 Personnel, and may stay within the area for no longer than 30 minutes at a time. Personnel experiencing any nausea or exhibiting any strange or psychotic behavior must be removed immediately and quarantined pending psychological and physical evaluation.

**Description:** SCP-794 is the derelict remains of a oceangoing vessel located at approximately +██° ██' ██.██", +██° ██' ██.██" near [REDACTED] in the Sahara Desert. According to markings in Cyrillic, the vessel is named the [REDACTED] and was built in ████ in the city of [REDACTED]. This is inconsistent with available records, as no vessel by this name was ever constructed. The vessel is also in an advanced state of disrepair consistent to exposure to the elements for a period of at least ██ years, yet has not further degraded since its discovery in 19██. To date, it is not known how SCP-794 came to rest in its current location, nearly ███ km from any body of water.

Living organism with a central nervous system that approach within 1400m of SCP-794-01 and remain for more than one hour begin to experience increasing sensations of nausea and in some cases, severe psychosis. Most subjects recover fully once they leave the area.

Every seventy minutes SCP-794 will emit a bright flash of light and, through unknown means, cause the nerve tissue of all living organisms within the Red Zone to be instantly and completely disintegrated.

SCP-794 was discovered on ██/█/██, after reports of a ██████ Air Force helicopter disappearing during a flight through [REDACTED], as well as a second aircraft tasked to locate it. SCP-794 was located shortly thereafter by a Foundation search team, and current containment protocols established.

Current research is focused on determining the method by which SCP-794 came to rest at its current location, and determining the exact source of its anomalous properties.
