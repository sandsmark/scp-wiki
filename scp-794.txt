**Item #:** SCP-794

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** The area in a 20km radius surrounding SCP-794-01 has been designated as a no-fly zone and all unauthorized personnel attempting to enter the Red Zone are to be detained for questioning. Unauthorized aircraft attempting to enter the airspace around SCP-794 are to be signalled off immediately, and any that fail to follow instructions are to be intercepted and detained at Containment Site 794-Alpha.

**Description:** SCP-794-01 is the derelict remains of a oceangoing vessel located at approximately +██° ██' ██.██", +██° ██' ██.██" near [REDACTED] in the Sahara Desert. Analysis so far has failed to identify the vessel, and it does not bear any resemblence to any registered vessel of any country. Mounted on the exposed rear deck of SCP-794-01 is a raised gimbal mount containing an as-of-yet unidentified weaponized device, hereby designated SCP-794-02. SCP-794-02 exhibits a condition inconsistent with the degraded state of the rest of the vessel, and will turn and move erratically at all times. To date, it is not known how the vessel came to rest in its current location, nearly ███ km from any body of water.

When any living human or remotely operated vehicle comes within 1400m of SCP-794-01, SCP-794-02 will rapidly turn and track the incoming subject. SCP-794-02 will then activate, producing a blinding white flash and, through an unknown mechanism, cause all neural tissue or electronic control components on its target to instantly vaporize.

SCP-794 was discovered on ██/█/██, after reports of a ██████ Air Force helicopter disappearing during a flight through [REDACTED], as well as two (2) search aircraft tasked to locate it. SCP-794 was located shortly thereafter by a Foundation search team, and current containment protocols established.

Current research is focused on determining SCP-794-01's identity, the method by which it came to rest at its current location, and devising a method by which it may be approached without activating SCP-794-02.
