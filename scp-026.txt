**Item #:** SCP-026

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-026 is to remain securely locked and boarded up anytime research is not ongoing.  Alarms are set to alert the Foundation in case of entry by civilians or other agencies.

**Description:** SCP-026 is a schoolhouse in ██████, ██.  In ████, it began displaying unusual properties.  Faculty began to have trouble navigating the building, though they'd worked in it for many years.  Students claimed that stairs had more steps going up than down.  Hallways seemed long enough that they should extend out of the building, though nothing appeared out of place from outside.  Several classrooms disappeared entirely.  It was abandoned two months later, due to "structural instability."  Nonetheless, it has remained standing in the intervening years.

Interviews with residents living nearby showed an uneasiness with the building.  Many of the local children had trespassed, often on a dare, but few stayed in very long.  Local gangs used it as an initiation rite, wherein new members would have to stay in long enough to paint graffiti on the walls.  The Foundation became interested after several missing persons reports in the area.

The building exhibits several unusual spatial phenomena.  In addition to those reported in ████, its internal floorplan has expanded, though the additions to its structure seem to change without warning.  Only the original structure remains static.  Some areas have shown odd physical properties as well, such as an apparent shift in gravity of up to thirty degrees, while adjacent areas remain unaffected.  In one hallway, objects and personnel were able to accelerate noticeably faster, while deceleration was more difficult.  Some of these effects are constant, while others seem merely transient.  A pattern has yet to be discerned.

Exploration of the new sections showed marked changes in the quality and style of the hallways.  Some appeared new, with fresh paint that chemical analysis showed to be only weeks old.  Others were as old and wrecked as the main structure.  Posters and styles of decoration seemed to come from several eras, with fifties-era posters warning of nuclear bombs in one section, and eighties-era "Just Say No" posters in another.  Graffiti fades unusually quickly, the paint appearing to be absorbed into the walls, while the original paint peels off normally (though occasionally in unusual colors).  Researchers have also reported hearing voices further in the structure, as though a class were being taught, though active subjects have never been discovered in any of the rooms.

Writing on the blackboards ranges from standard school subjects (mathematics, literature, biology), to more esoteric subjects, such as quantum entanglement, ████████, and eugenics.  One researcher reported one board detailing information about SCP-████, but photographic evidence showed only a blank slate.

[[/div]]

Some rooms have been found with living humans inside of them, mostly of high school age, ranging from twelve to eighteen.  They are dressed in accordance to the school's dress code, circa ████.  They are seated at desks, seemingly asleep, but cannot be roused.  Some have been identified as former students, while others were found to be missing gang members.  Two older subjects have been found, later identified as former teachers.  None of the students or teachers were reported missing when the school was abandoned, but disappeared years after the fact.  Researchers are currently at a loss to explain their presence in SCP-026.  Any time any of them have been removed from the location, they die within hours from rapid dehydration, even when given fluids intravenously.  Subsequent decomposition is rapid.

Research has been abandoned for the moment, after several researchers vanished while exploring a previously unknown wing of the school.
