**Item #:** SCP-203

**Object Class:** Euclid 

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-203 is to be kept in Storage Bunker 3-A at Site ██ while powered down. Two D-Class personnel equipped with sound filtration equipment are required to guard Bunker 3-A in case of accidental activation of defense mechanism. While active, SCP-203 is to be accompanied by an armed escort to any testing procedures. 

**Description:** SCP-203 appears to at one time have been a Caucasian human male of indeterminate age. Subject is two and a half (2 ½) meters tall (though it is theorized that the “skeletal” framework augments subject’s original height) and weighs two-hundred (200) kilograms. 

The subject’s entire skeletal structure has been removed and replaced with a mechanical framework made of cast iron that seems to move on its own volition. This framework appears to be the sole source of SCP-203’s “life”, as all internal organs have been removed. On several points on the subject’s body, the skin has split, revealing a section of the subcutaneous metal framework. In other places, it seems the metal has been crafted with the intention to show through the skin. Included augmentations include, but are not limited to:

* The fingers have been extended into sharpened barbs approx. one (1) meter long.
* The lips are missing, revealing that SCP-203 lacks a jawbone, suggesting that the skull is a single, hollow piece. Remaining mouth skin has been tied into the skull with several hook-like protrusions. In place of the mouth, a small, speaker-like grate has been welded. This is used for rudimentary communication.
* The vertebrae have been replaced with a segmented iron bar, which has several sharp barbs haphazardly welded to it.
* The legs have two added joints with tubes of an unknown purpose protruding from them.
* The ribcage is not enclosed, and appears hollow and sunken.
* Ears removed.
* [EXPUNGED] removed.
* All toes removed, replaced with a solid piece of iron, vaguely resembling the metal insert of a steel toe boot.
* Eyes have been retained, but are held in the forward-facing position by several needles protruding from the eye socket. Irises also have no response to light.

While lacking vocal cords, SCP-203 can communicate verbally through the “speaker” located on its faceplate. It appears to understand some English, but its primary language appears to be a previously unknown Arabic dialect. SCP-203 does not recall a life before its augmentations, only that it feels constant pain and confusion. 

SCP-203 appears to run on an internal power cell that runs for a 72-hour period, after which the subject enters into a state of hibernation that lasts between 3 and 4 hours. Subject cannot advertently deactivate this power source, though it has expressed that these periods of “sleep” are the only escape it has from its otherwise miserable existence.

X-rays, CT, ultrasound, and all other forms of diagnostic imagery have proven incapable of penetrating the internal workings of SCP-203, and exploratory surgery activates a secondary defense mechanism that [REDACTED].

It has recently come to light that SCP-203 has the ability to emit a feedback-like “screech” that has a severely damaging effect on the human brain. However, this only seems to happen when subject is provoked or harmed. For more information regarding this ability, see the attached testing log.

SCP-203 has, on numerous occasions, requested either anesthetics or analgesics. These requests are pending approval.

**Testing Log**

**Test Format:**
Subject:
Presiding Researcher:
Method of Induction:
Result: [Time after exposure]:

Subject: Personnel D-104
Presiding Researcher: N/A
Method of Induction: Accidental. SCP-203 is struck by D-104 when it refuses to enter storage. When SCP-203 starts to screech, D-104 continues his assault, and forces SCP-203 into containment.
Result: 
[1 minute after exposure]: Subject experiences a severe headache.
[15 minutes after exposure]: Subject’s headache increases in intensity and his ears begin to bleed. SCP-203 continues to screech. (Note: D-171, the other guard on duty, is not affected by the sound)
[20 minutes after exposure]: Subject leaves his post and checks himself into infirmary.
[30 minutes after exposure]: Subject experiences seizure. Subject is now bleeding from all extremities.
[35 minutes after exposure]: Subject begins to scream “shut it up”, though he is no longer within audible range of SCP-203.
[40 minutes after exposure]: Subject flat lines. Post mortem reveals that Subject’s brain has been completely liquefied.

Subject: Personnel D-090
Presiding Researcher: Dr. █████ ████
Method of Induction: Subject is locked in cell with SCP-203 while being observed via remote cameras. D-090 is equipped with a taser and is told to use said weapon on SCP-203. Subject is reluctant, but complies. SCP-203 begins screeching 30 seconds after provocation.
Result:
[1 minute after exposure]: Subject becomes agitated and tases SCP-203 again. SCP-203 continues screeching and assumes fetal position.
[10 minutes after exposure]: Subject begins holding head and ears and nose begin to bleed. SCP-203 continues to screech.
[25 minutes after exposure]: Subject experiences seizure. SCP-203 appears to stop screeching. However, later analysis reveals that the frequency of the emitted sound has simply moved beyond the human range of hearing.
[35 minutes after exposure]: Subject begins vomiting blood and bleeding from the eyes.
[40 minutes after exposure]: Subject appears to be dead. Emitted sound genuinely ceases.
[44 minutes after exposure]: SCP-203 stands and moves toward the body of subject. SCP-203 then begins to surgically remove subject’s skeleton. At this time, SCP-203 is removed from cell and put into storage. (Note: test seems to indicate that SCP-203’s defense mechanism is also a method of producing more SCP-203-like entities. Further tests in allowing SCP-203 to continue this process are being considered.)
