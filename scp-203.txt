**Item #:** SCP-203

**Object Class:** Safe/Euclid 

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-203 is to be kept in Storage Bunker 3-A at Site [DATA EXPUNGED] while powered down. Two D-Class personnel are required to guard Bunker 3-A in case of accidental reactivation. While active, SCP-203 is to be accompanied by an armed escort to any testing procedures. 

**Description:** SCP-203 appears to at one time have been a Caucasian human male of indeterminate age. The subject’s entire skeletal structure has been removed and replaced with a mechanical framework made of cast iron that seems to move on its own volition. This framework appears to be the sole source of SCP-203’s “life”, as all internal organs have been removed. On several points on the subject’s body, the skin has split, revealing a section of the subcutaneous metal framework. In other places, it seems the metal has been crafted with the intention to show through the skin. Included augmentations include, but are not limited to:

* The fingers have been extended into sharpened barbs.
* The lips are missing, revealing that SCP-203 lacks a jawbone, suggesting that the skull is a single, hollow piece. Remaining mouth skin has been tied into the skull with several hook-like protrusions.
* The vertebrae have been replaced with a segmented iron bar, which has several sharp barbs haphazardly welded to it.
* The legs have two added joints with tubes of an unknown purpose protruding from them.
* The ribcage is not enclosed, and appears hollow and sunken.
* Ears removed.
* [EXPUNGED] removed.
* All toes removed, replaced with a solid piece of iron, vaguely resembling the metal insert of a steel toe boot.
* Eyes have been retained, but are held in the forward-facing position by several needles protruding from the eye socket. Irises also have no response to light.

Due to a lack of vocal cords, SCP-203 is incapable of verbal communication. However, it can communicate through hand signs and crude writing. SCP-203 does not recall a life before its augmentations, only that it feels constant pain and confusion. 

SCP-203 appears to run on an internal power cell that requires recharging after a 72-hour period. This power can also be shut off via verbal command and responds to the passcode “████████████” 

X-rays and all other forms of diagnostic imagery have proven incapable of penetrating the internal workings of SCP-203, and exploratory surgery activated a defense mechanism that [REDACTED].
SCP-203 has, on numerous occasions, requested either anesthetics or analgesics. These requests are pending approval.

**Addendum SCP-203a:** Due to recent events of Incident 203-A, SCP-203 has been reclassified to Safe/Euclid. See Document I203-A for details.
