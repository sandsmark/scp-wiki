**Item #:** SCP-807

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-807 is to be kept in a locked safe deposit box at Site 19's High Value Item Storage Facility. Standard positive-action defenses (explosive, chemical, biological, and memetic) are to be in place at all times, according to standard operating procedure.

SCP-807 may be removed from its storage container with proper authorization for experimentation. All personnel working around SCP-807 must be well-fed, and should preferably wear oral restraints to prevent accidental ingestion.

**Description:** SCP-807 is a salmon-colored ceramic plate, of the standard dimensions for a dinner plate, with the words "Last Chance Diner" printed on the edges in white. A small piece has been chipped out of one edge of the plate, just above the letter D. There are no manufacturer's marks, and to date, all efforts to find the restaurant in question have failed.

SCP-807 has the unusual property of transmuting any food served upon it into a fatty, cholesterol-laden variation of its original form. Once transmuted, the food in question is enhanced in flavor and aroma to preternatural levels, to the point where the desire to consume said food becomes nearly irresistable. Anyone who does consume said food, however, will undergo cardiac arrest within five minutes of finishing their meal, due to rapid fatty buildup in the major arteries. In some cases, immediate bypass surgery has been shown to be effective in saving the life of a subject.
