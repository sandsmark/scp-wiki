There, at a moment of the death of all things, stand two individuals. The man is irrelevant and we need not discuss him now.

He is looking at her. "Josephine?" he asks.

"You recognize me?" she responded.

"You meet certain...characteristics, ones I am familiar with," he will ask. "I have never been able to find you before. What has changed?"

"I am good at hiding," she is saying. "There is little to hide from now. The sun's supernova is about to commence. We will not survive much longer."

"You will not survive," he has said. "I am hardly bound by conventional space and time. I...I am surprised that you still are."

"That I have not ascended to a higher plane of consciousness?" she will be asking. "Like the others of my kind? Like your friends at the Foundation assumed I would? Everyone was so afraid of me," and at this point she spoke the name of the being she was conversing with, which we cannot repeat here, "and none of them stopped to consider that the converse applied just as well. I was far more afraid of them. And I was sure as hell afraid of godhood. I'd rather live my lifespan, not to mention the lifespans of several hundred million generations, than do...well, whatever it is that you did."

The man will have thought about this for what seemed like a much longer time. "Do you want to see what they felt? Do you want to see what they knew?"

"I know what they knew," she had thought. "I took that knowledge from them as I removed it from their minds."

"I saw it from their point of view, as well as yours," he will be saying. "I can give you this knowledge. Call it a parting gift."

She was pausing, then smiling. "I appreciate it."

And then, at once, she knew. Her smile remained until the moment the fires reached her.

The ultimate reality of the universe we write in is that most people live in one world, the normal world, while a select group of individuals live in a world beyond that. Whether in the Foundation, or the Serpent's Hand, or the Chaos Insurgency, these are individuals who interact with normal life only from a distance, manipulating figures like chessmen on a board.

Josephine manipulates the Foundation in much the same way.

A powerful reality bender, Josephine has largely escaped detection from the Foundation through a combination of staying off the radar and certain...manipulations of select memories. Her abilities are immense, but not unlimited. A small cadre of Foundation researchers have identified her, using the codename "GREEN KING", and are working against her. Josephine's ultimate intent is escape, rather than revenge; hiding, rather than attacking. Yet as with all reality benders, exposure to power of her caliber is dangerous to her mind as well as her soul, and the Foundation cannot be at fault for all of the conflict that is occurring.

++ Suggested Topics for Future Stories

1. Most of the writings so far show aspects of the conflict between Josephine and the Foundation that highlight the Foundation's losses. Regardless, this isn't always the case; Josephine has lost her share of battles too, even if knowledge of them might be...hard to come by.

2. The Foundation isn't the only player in the game; Josephine and the other Groups of Interest have their conflicts with one another. The Global Occult Coalition in particular has its eyes set on the destruction of anomalous entities exactly such as Josephine; while their involvement in the Green King project is limited at present, this may need further elaboration.

3. The technology available to the Foundation has grown in the century-and-change that the Green King project has been in operation, and the project must have its own R&D efforts in place to keep itself alive. You could write about the weapons and defenses the Foundation designs to use against an enemy that not only presents a challenge against any attacker, but that can make the attacker forget everything it ever knew about the Foundation.
