**Item #:** SCP-3158

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Standard exclusionary precautions for medium-size stationary oceanic anomalies apply for SCP-3158. Expungement of SCP-3158 from satellite imagery is unnecessary. Access is denied to all personnel.

**Description:** SCP-3158 is a tropical island, located 42 kilometers off the coast of ███████, with an area of 4.8km^^2^^. Subjects present on SCP-3158 will secrete blood, rather than tears, from their lacrimal glands. This does not result in irritation, as would be expected; rather, the blood adequately fulfills the functions of the tear film, albeit resulting in a red tint to the subject's vision. All anomalous effects cease once the subject leave SCP-3158.

Affected subjects will prefer not to acknowledge the presence of blood in their eyes, attempting to refocus any such discussion on SCP-3158's natural beauty, calmness, or exoticism. The blood does not match the genetic profile of the subject, but rather, that of [DATA LOST].

Individuals that observe a 15m x 60m area in the southeastern region of SCP-3158, designated SCP-3158-1, experience an intense, painful sensation of hunger that does not abate until they leave SCP-3158. Subjects will attempt to consume any material they believe to be edible, save for individuals they consider to be of similar or higher social status.

No subject has voluntarily discussed this phenomenon, or their actions while under its effect, instead attempting to refocus any such discussion on SCP-3158's suitability as a travel destination.

Prior to Incident 3158-Alpha, SCP-3158-1 was the site of [DATA LOST]. SCP-3158 came to Foundation attention shortly thereafter, after several soldiers reported SCP-3158's anomalous effects.
