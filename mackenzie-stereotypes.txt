title:Dr. Mackenzie's Guide to Author Stereotypes
[[f>toc]]
By popular request, I am creating this list of bad author stereotypes in order to enlighten the community. If it's not clear enough by the tone of writing, you do **not** want to be one of these. :)

**Disclaimer:** This document is meant to be a tongue-in-cheek analysis of common types of bad newbies. None of these are targeted at any particular person, and is meant to be entertaining, not offensive.

----

+ The Emo Teenager
Emo Teens appear in all forms, from the obvious to the subtle. While a SCP based on Linkin Park lyrics is pretty much unmistakable, this stereotype generally applies to any author who says something along the lines of:

> Life sucks, so I write because nothing else matters.

Or:

> Nobody understands me or what I'm going through. You don't understand my pain [or my writing].

When their submission bombs out, you'll also generally see something like this:

> I'm sorry I suck so much. I'm gonna go kill myself now.

There's something to be said for being honest and humble when you first start writing in a community with such high standards as the SCP Foundation, but there's a limit to how much of this you can get away with before you start annoying everyone. As I've mentioned in my Documentation Tips before, the SCP Foundation's authors tend to be on the mature side, with the average age of authors well over 20. If you are a teenager (and especially one suffering from teenage angst issues), this is probably **not** the site for you. We aren't here to listen to your whining, and you're not going to find sympathy.

Note: Yes, I have actually seen someone threaten to kill themselves when their SCP got downvoted. If you are in this boat, then you need serious help. Immediately.

**Empathy Level:** 3/10 - A lot of us have been there before, but that doesn't make it an excuse.
**Annoyance Level:** 8/10 - Those of us who have been there don't like to be reminded of it.
**Redeemability:** 1/10 - You generally can't do anything about them. They'll either grow out of it (making it a self-fixing problem) or go elsewhere. Like MySpace.

+ The Kamikaze
We here who are major contributors to the SCP Foundation understand and enjoy the fact that people get really excited about the Foundation. After all, for some of us here, this is practically our major obsession and we love that other people love it. We love to see people speculate, and we love to see people come up with more ideas on how the site and the community can be contributed to or improved.

What worries us, however, is when a fresh newbie barrels down on our site, heedless of advice, and slams into the community with a poorly conceived, poorly written, and usually error-filled piece of writing that looks like it fell out of the Tree of Bad Ideas and hit every branch on the way down. If you are imagining a bullet-ridden Zero with its pilot screaming "BANZAI!" at the top of his lungs at this point, then you know why we call them this.

The moral of the story is that the Foundation values quality over all else. Please take the time to read through all of the required and relevant guides and essays that relate to your idea. Bounce your ideas and drafts off of the community first, and above all **take their advice** when given, especially from established authors. We are more than willing to help you get off the ground, but you have to help yourself as well.

**Empathy Level:** 1/10 - Before you were accepted to the Foundation, you should have read all of the guides first. This level of haphazard writing is inexcusable.
**Annoyance Level:** 6/10 - Thankfully, people who fly their work into the site at top speed rarely come back for a second round.
**Redeemability:** 3/10 - Once in a blue moon you can calm one of these kids down, but the degree to which their asses are on fire usually causes them to either burn out or crash hard.

+ The Special Snowflake
A close relative to the Emo Teen, the Special Snowflake has been told by **everyone** that they are an awesome author. This includes their teachers, their parents, their friends, all their followers on DeviantArt... Does anyone else see the problem here?

The best kind of feedback is the kind you get from people who are **not** invested in you. Your friends and teachers are there to support you, do you really honestly think they'll be brutally honest when something you write is truly terrible? Coupled with the aforementioned high standards of the Foundation community, this is a disaster waiting to happen that usually ends with this:

> Why are you guys being so mean? This is good stuff, it's just a little different.

You may also see gems like this once in a while:

> My [high school] teacher says I write at a college level. I can do this just fine.

When finally confronted with a SCP that's tanked well below -30, you will finally see the Rage State of the Special Snowflake:

> [expletive] you all! I'm going back to [insert amateur art/writing gallery here] where they aren't assholes.


**Empathy Level:** 4/10 - When you're young and you haven't taken hard hits yet, it's not easy to know the difference between friendly sympathy and true feedback.
**Annoyance Level:** 7/10 - Unless malicious, these kids tend to not come back, making them a one-time problem.
**Redeemability:** 3/10 - Once in a while, you can convince a Snowflake to take a deep breath and learn to take feedback, but they usually wander back to the holes they crawled out of. On the plus side, Snowflake Rage States are hilarious to watch.

+ Minor Stereotypes
These stereotypes aren't significant enough to warrant their own heading, but still merit mention.

++ The Coat-tail Rider
Here at the SCP Foundation, being a writing website, we encourage newbies to be inventive and creative. If you've been here any amount of time, you'll have noticed that SCPs that are too similar to existing ones tend to be panned. We want to see new things, unique takes on the paranormal, and most importantly SCPs that stand on their own without leaning on existing canon.

The Coat-tail Rider takes two forms. The first is the author who has literally never written anything on their own. They will go on for hours about new and inventive ways of killing [[[SCP-682]]], exciting things to do with [[[SCP-914]]], and debate endlessly about how we could decommission or at least make [[[SCP-173]]] safer. The first type may even go as far as writing a tale based exclusively on a popular SCP, but never comes up with their own original content.

The second form is the author who writes a mediocre SCP, then immediately cross-links it to no less than half a dozen other SCPs. This usually takes the form of "suggest testing against these SCPs" or more rarely "never let these SCPs come together". A more extreme version is the author that actually edits the existing popular SCP without permission and adds a backlink to his own article.

++ The Horror Snob
From the page [[[About the SCP Foundation]]]:
> Our Goals
> 
> * Observe preternatural phenomena and develop new theories of science based on their observable behavior.
> * Contain potentially dangerous phenomena
> * Develop safety procedures for dealing with all future phenomena
> * Observe, detain, and destroy any one or any thing preventing us from accomplishing the above-stated goals.

One of the most obnoxious types of newbie is the one who's strongly opinionated and is determined to downvote anything that isn't "scary" or "creepy". While it's true that the ones that stick with you the best are the ones that make you a little nervous at night, there's nothing that says a SCP **has** to be creepy. Some of the best SCPs on the site are simply inexplicable; we don't understand how they work, and they leave you wildly speculating. Don't be the annoying person who automatically downvotes something just because it doesn't scare you.

++ The Kibitzer
Here at the SCP Foundation, we value honest criticism from all members, whether you are an author or not. Obviously if you've got a few popular SCPs under your belt then people are more liable to respect you, but you don't have to be an artist to be an art critic and even newbies can have good advice sometimes.

What does **not** go over well is when someone drops really, really bad advice and makes it look like it's an authoritative opinion. Something like:

> This is okay, but what it really needs is some cross-testing with SCP-173 and SCP-682 and a couple of test logs. You need to put in some humor to contrast the seriousness too, maybe have someone accidentally kill a bunch of researchers.

Note: If you don't know why this is bad advice, then you really, really need to go back and read the guides again.

++ The Outsourcer
Closely related to the Coat-tails Rider, the Outsourcer is the same problem from a different direction. Rather than simply ride on others' work, the Outsourcer writes the bare minimum of what's necessary to create a SCP, leaves it in an unpolished state, and expects the community to finish it for them.

Contrary to popular belief, the SCP Foundation is not a wiki in the traditional sense, where every article has a dozen hands in it. We want to see **your** writing, **your** vision, and if you don't have a fully fleshed out article, then we'd prefer that you keep it to yourself until it's ready for prime-time.

Signs of an Outsourcer include:

> If you have any ideas on how to improve this, feel free to edit it.

As well as:

> I like that idea. Could you write that in for me?

To reiterate: A collaborative effort is one in which one or more people have established a firm foundation for a concept that could be expanded upon within the framework that has been established. If you don't even have anything to stand on in the first place but you want others to finish it for you, that's flat out laziness.

+ More to Come!
