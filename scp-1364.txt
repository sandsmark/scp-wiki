**Item #:** SCP-1364

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** At this time, there are no means of keeping SCP-1364 completely safe, and methods are currently being researched into the minimization of damage dealt to SCP-1364. SCP-1364 should be contained within a 10 m x 10 m x 5 m chamber with 50 cm padded impact-resistant polyester lining on all inside surfaces. The area should remain completely devoid of light and sound. The containment chamber should be kept completely empty to ensure SCP-1364 remains docile and 'healthy'. Any observation of damage taken by SCP-1364, or any signs of pain should be dealt with promptly with any resources available to aid in minimizing damage. 

Personnel are forbidden to interact with SCP-1364 in any way save for manipulation of a projector using shadow-projecting images depicting calming situations on the wall of SCP-1364s containment chamber. A foundation issued audio CD entitled "Nature Sounds" is to be on constant playback within the cell at a volume of 10 decibels looping alongside playback similar to Shepard tone.

The chamber itself is to be filtered for contaminants on a low cycle each hour.

**Description:** SCP-1324 is a small, mammalian creature resembling an anteater. SCP-1364 is friendly, on certain occasions attempting to embrace researchers with an elongated tongue located near its nostrils. It does not appear to be sapient and shows limited if diminishing signs of intelligence. 

SCP-1364 has extremely poor endurance and mobility depending on its current state. SCP-1364s physical form remains relatively static when unexposed to a significant amount of stimulus, however, the creature grows increasingly vulnerable to even the most negligible of stimulus with prolonged exposure; the subject seems to respond normally to a stimulus on the first exposure, although repetitious introduction is exponentially harmful to SCP-1364. Despite the presence of a digestive system the creature does not seem to require sustenance; testing reveals that the creature in fact fares better without it as the process of mastication, swallowing, digestion and defecation cause significant bodily stress. The cause of SCP-1364's extreme vulnerability has not yet been discovered, as the body shows no specific physical anomalies.

SCP-1364 appears to heal at a standard rate when left alone.

The creature was discovered after repeated reports of its disappearing and reappearing beneath floors and inside walls at ███████████ Zoo's nursery prior to containment; amnesiacs were administered to witnesses after recovery.

**Addendum 1364-B:** Stimulus Testing:
//Foreword: Repeated applications conducted within 5 minutes of each other. The effect of exponential sensitivity seems to reset after a period of a few hours.//

|| **Stimulus** || **Effect** ||
|| 
|| **Physical** ||
|| 
|| Water (x3 applications) || Hair loss, subject appears distressed. ||
|| Saline (x3 applications) || Negligible skin irritation, subject appears distressed. ||
|| Exposure to candle (x3 applications) || Subject covered in first degree burns, subject becomes temporarily comatose. ||
|| Droplet of ethanoic acid (x3 applications) || Droplet burned through subjects paw, subject appears extremely distressed.||
|| Subject rubbed against Copper (x1 application) || [DATA EXPUNGED] ||
|| Subject dropped lightly on natural rubber surface || No noticeable physical effect. ||
|| No stimulus || Subject appears distressed. ||
||
|| **Sound** ||
|| 
|| Utterance of "Hello" by Dr. Sanders, conversational. (x3 applications) || No noticeable physical effect, subject appears distressed. ||
|| Utterance of "Hello" by Dr. Sanders, voice raised. (x3 applications) || Discharge of blood form ear canal, subject appears distressed. ||
|| 
|| **Light** ||
|| 
|| Daylight //10 hours// || No noticeable physical affect aside from very mild skin irritation. ||
|| Fluorescent office light //8 hours// || Subject appears disoriented; eyes close tightly. ||
|| Aimed floodlight //2 hours// || Light appears to pass through the subject in certain places. In these spots the skeletal system of SCP-1364 is clearly visible, as are the circulatory system and some internal organs. Hair appears to glow white. Subject appears to levitate until the light is switched off. No physical damage can be noted aside from negligible burns. ||
|| Arc lamp //1 hour// || Similar results as previous, although all internal structure of SCP-1364 is completely visible. ||
|| Beam at 30 billion candle power //45 seconds// || Subject appears to disappear while the light is working. Personnel equipped with welding goggles attempting to make physical contact with SCP-1364 are unsuccessful. SCP-1364 is found on the inside of the cell wall and was clearly visible when the power from the light is removed. ||

//Note: Further physical tests are not recommended, although research  is currently underway regarding the cause of the particular transmogrification during the copper testing.//
