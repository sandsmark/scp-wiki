**Item #:** SCP-754

**Object Class:** Euclid (Request for Keter classification under review, 20██/██/██)

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-754-1 is to be kept on a table in an isolated room, and must at all times be visible to the surveillance camera. The room must be equipped with a liquid nitrogen emergency coolant system. A shallow planter of standard potting soil has been placed next to SCP-754-1 to provide a "target zone" for SCP-754-2 germination events.

No instances of SCP-754 are to be retained, outside of use in sanctioned experiments. Material containing SCP-754-1 may be incinerated.

To dispose of SCP-754-2, the room must be sealed and liquid nitrogen piped in until the ambient temperature has been at or below 150 K for a minimum of fifteen (15) minutes. SCP-754-2, any surrounding soil, and all instances of SCP-754-1 shall be incinerated, save one paper fragment of approximately twenty-five (25) square centimetres, which is to be treated as "seed stock" with a freshly-illustrated sheet. If SCP-754-2 germinates from a location other than the provided planter, the site should be sterilized with hydrochloric acid. In the event of containment system failure of SCP-754-2, its growth will be inhibited by temperatures below 250 K until automated systems are restored.

One (1) standard sheet of paper with hand-drawn illustrations is to be placed on the table as needed. Current procedures call for the replacement and disposal of the oldest illustration once the newer sheet shows evidence of buds; at the current rate of growth, replacement should occur every two to three days. If this rate is observed to increase, notify the level 3 supervisor (as of 20██/██/██, Doctor Cairns). Under no circumstances are any SCP objects containing hand-drawn illustrations to be allowed within twenty (20) metres of SCP-754-1.

**Description:** SCP-754 is superficially similar to //Convolvulus arvensis//, a flowering vine commonly known as "morning glory" or "field bindweed" in North America. Its leaves and vine are red with delicate black veins. Flowers, when present, are red with black mottling. SCP-754 will propagate in a manner similar to bindweed. However, it can overgrow any object, including those typically resistant to plant growth and water too deep for root stabilization. It can attain a top growth rate of █ metres per hour. It is inhibited by temperatures below 250 K (-23°C), and enters a dormant state when chilled below 150 K (-123°C).

SCP-754 can appear in two forms, denoted SCP-754-1 and SCP-754-2.

SCP-754-1 presents as an additional image in hand-rendered illustrations, indistinguishable from the original contents in terms of medium, style, and scale. SCP-754-1 will propagate through the whitespace remaining on the material, as well as overgrowing illustrated objects. The growth rate is constant in the scale of the illustration; consequently, the linear spread across the material is not constant. SCP-754-1 can also propagate to other illustrations within a fifteen (15) metre radius; the time required to do so decreases with proximity and physical contact. Illustrations containing SCP-754-1 demonstrate a mild psychic suggestion effect: individuals below eighty (80) on the Psychic Resistance Scale will insist that SCP-754-1 has always been present in the illustration, and those below ninety (90) on the Psychic Resistance Scale will be reluctant to destroy SCP-754-1 unless prompted or trained.

Illustrations containing SCP-754-1 will animate and change in response to the growth of SCP-754-1. They appear to be moving at a one-tenth (0.1 x) speed slow motion. It has not been determined if this occurs as a stop motion effect or as a constant movement. Volitional beings depicted in the illustration will react to SCP-754-1 and utilise other depicted objects as appropriate. The most common reaction observed is the attempt to restrict the growth of SCP-754-1.

When no whitespace remains on any illustrated material within range, SCP-754-2 will germinate within five (5) metres of SCP-754-1. This occurs no more than three (3) hours after the complete overgrowth of all whitespace in range. It will preferentially appear where a plant might germinate, for example, open soil or a pavement crack.

SCP-754 will appear to be controlled by incineration. However, any root fragments left intact will be stimulated and [DATA EXPUNGED] within six (6) hours. Additionally, any chordate with mucous membrane contact to the ashes will, within twelve (12) hours, [DATA EXPUNGED]. Further instances of SCP-754 will then erupt from the distinctive petechiae. Dormant SCP-754 can be incinerated without inducing [DATA EXPUNGED]; root fragments must still be destroyed to prevent normal plant regrowth. No side effects have been observed from the incineration of material bearing SCP-754-1.

**Addendum 754-01 - Circumstances of retrieval:** SCP-754 was first brought to the attention of the Foundation when police officers in █████████, France, arrested an office worker who was raving and attacking courtyard weeds with a carbon dioxide (CO,,2,,) fire extinguisher. Foundation intervention was required when forty-five (45) infestations of SCP-754-2 subsequently developed in residential areas. However, thanks to the timely suggestions of the office worker, in Foundation custody by this time, the containment team suffered no casualties. The level 3 observer in charge, Doctor Cairns, recommended the office worker for a position with the Foundation, instead of a class A amnesiac. The request was approved, and Investigator D█████-1/754 remains in charge of SCP-754 containment as of 20██/██/██.

**Addendum 754-02:** After the events of Experiment 754-07, personnel with figurative tattoos, brandings, or other decorative body modifications are forbidden from coming within twenty (20) metres of SCP-754, save for participation in sanctioned experiments.
