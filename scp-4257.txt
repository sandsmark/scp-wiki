**Special Containment Procedures:** Nine of the 15 known instances of SCP-4257 are kept in a secure container at Site-81. The six instances not in containment are currently in low-earth orbit with an expected reentry date of 2041/10/10. Testing of SCP-4257 on human subjects requires approval from the Ethics Committee and the Department of Orbital Objects Tracking (DOOT).

[[include component:image-block name=Pill.jpg|caption=SCP-4257.]]

**Description:** SCP-4257 is the group designation for 15 pills created by parapharmacologist and Person of Interest "dado". The pills are bottled in a standered orange prescription container with the words "space drive by dado" written on the surface by a black marker.

Once ingested, SCP-4257 will transform the subject into an automobile, designated SCP-4257-1, over the course of an hour. The make and model of which is that typically used within their cultural background and age group. SCP-4257-1 will lack components or possess mechanical complications analogous to their human physical disabilities, although these do not appear to affect its primary anomalous properties. SCP-4257-1 entities retain their memories and personality after transformation and can perform rudimentary communication via the manipulation of their components.

SCP-4257-1 instances are capable of moving in only two directions: the direction opposite of gravity and forward. Instances can achieve high velocities with low amounts of fuel and do not require contact with a surface to move. 

**Addendum 4257-1: Discovery**

SCP-4257 was discovered on 2020/01/22 following a report from NORAD[[footnote]]North American Aerospace Defense Command[[/footnote]] of an object on an anomalous flight path entering low-earth orbit. Satellite imaging of the object identified it as a 2001 Chevy Malibu with a missing headlight and rust covering over 80% of its frame. Six instances of SCP-4257 were recorded floating in the automotive's cabin. Tracking of its flight trajectory led Foundation agents to the abandoned home of a Dave Gelespie where the remaining nine pills were recovered.

**Addendum 4257-2: Recovered Message Logs**

//Note: The following instant messaging excerpts were discovered on the personal computer of Dave Gelespie.//
