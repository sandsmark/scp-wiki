**Item #:** SCP-2045

**Object Class:** --Safe-- --Euclid-- Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2045 is to be continuously covered with a dummy tractor to maintain the appearance of normality. Any civilians who come into contact with SCP-2045 are to be amnesticized. All debris left by SCP-2045 is to be cleared away by Foundation assets. Methods to contain SCP-2045 are currently being considered.

**Description:** SCP-2045 is a large and mobile pile of molasses currently located in the American Northwest.

SCP-2045 is approximately 30 x 30 x 10 meters in dimension; with fluctuations based on movement and absorbed objects. SCP-2045's main mass consists of blackstrap molasses. SCP-2045 weighs about 13,131,600 kgs,[[footnote]]For reference; the expected mass of a 30 x 30 x 10 m block of molasses is 13,125,600 kg[[/footnote]] indicating that SCP-2045 has subsumed a significant amount of material during its existence.

SCP-2045 flows at an approximate rate of 10 km/yr. When SCP-2045 was first discovered (on 5/6/1911, in the Cascade Mountain Range), it was believed that motion was due solely to the effect of gravity, similar to glacier movement. However, as of 9/3/2089, when SCP-2045 completely detached from the Cascades onto the plateau, SCP-2045 continued motion at a rate of ~8 km/yr despite no obvious motive force.

Objects that come into contact with SCP-2045 are rapidly absorbed into the anomaly itself. While it is possible to mount a recovery operation for people trapped in SCP-2045, the resources involved are tremendous, and due to the large amount of physical trauma and rapid asphyxiation that occurs, the likelihood of rescue is low. Out of the five rescue attempts undertaken to rescue Foundation personnel, only one has been successful to date.

SCP-2045 has a large amount of objects trapped in it, in a manner similar to the action of glaciers. In addition to a large number of boulders, dirt, and assorted organic matter, SCP-2045 also appears to contain a multitude of bones, housing debris, a parachute harness, and several firearms of indistinct make. Due to SCP-2045's composition, these appear to be perfectly preserved; and, when deposited, can serve as a valuable geologic record.

The age of SCP-2045 is unknown: radiocarbon dating has been inconclusive, and SCP-2045 has suffered no apparent deterioration during its time in Foundation observation, indicating an extremely long potential lifespan.

Due to the motion of SCP-2045, a trail of debris is perpetually left behind it, in a pattern similar to glacier debris. In order to avoid suspicion, these debris are to be collected as described in the containment procedures.

SCP-2045 was first discovered by the Foundation in 1911, during a flyover of the Cascades to test then-new aerial surveillance technology. Due to its isolation, SCP-2045 was classified as safe and kept under nominal surveillance. However, after an unknown event altered the course of SCP-2045, resulting in the destruction of the town of Centennial, the object classification was raised to Euclid, and to Keter when it was realized that SCP-2045 did not require gravity to power its movements. To date, SCP-2045 has been under Foundation observation and containment for 203 years, with a total travel distance of 1980 km.
