**Item #:** SCP-268
 
**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** --SCP-268 is currently to be maintained within [DATA EXPUNGED], as it has been deemed that the change of use for facilitation of escape by restricted personnel or humanoid SCP is too great.  However, the possibility of use by field agents after further testing is under review.--  See addendum 268-04.
 
**Description:** SCP-268 is a tweed wool newsboy cap. The design and make seem to be of Irish origin. Due to the style and fabric, it's estimated to have been created in the late 1800's to early 1900's, though fiber analysis is inconclusive .  The only markings on the cap are a small label with writing in Middle Irish, reading "The Garden is the Serpent's Place."  However, there are are various indications that this label was sown in recent times.

Due to the nature of the artifact, testing has been extremely difficult. Whilst unworn, SCP-268 seems to be a normal hat for all intents and purposes.  However, when worn, the subject wearing the artifact becomes suddenly unnoticeable and unmemorable to all observers. Observers seem to, despite the circumstances, ignore or "take for granted" those wearing SCP-268. Observers, with some prompting, are able to later recall physically seeing the subject, but can give no specific details other "seeing a man with hat".  Observers seem to have the overwhelming feeling that the wearer is someone was "supposed to be there", and thus did not merit thought or notice. 

During initial testing, it took some remote analysts upwards of ten minutes to remember what exactly they were supposed to be observing in the chamber, and it was not until the test subject wearing SCP-268 spoke that he was noticed again. Vocalization and physical interaction with observers seem to be the only way in which wearers of SCP-268 can make themselves noticeable.

Electronics seem to be only partially immune to SCP-268's effects; pictures of SCP-268 being worn don't develop correctly, and digital media such as surveillance cameras become grainy and unfocused.  In all cases, the face is always unrecognizable. Furthermore, viewing a wearer through remote means seems to still induce the lapse in active perception of the subject.  Further testing with various electronic means is to be required, but testing so far indicates SCP-268 is extremely hard to capture while active.

 
**Addendum 268-01:** //SCP-268's effects seem to strengthen and become permanent as individual subjects wear the artifact for extended periods of cumulative time.  There is a marked difference in the potency of SCP-268's effect on someone wearing it for the first time, and someone who has worn the artifact upwards of five hours on other occasions. For example, someone who has not worn the cap before seems to dispel its effects merely by speaking.  Those who have worn the artifact on several occasions for extended amounts of time seem to be able to ask observers questions and receive answers with the observer having little to no recollection of the event.  In one test, a subject who had worn the artifact for upwards of fifteen hours was able to ask standing personnel the test chamber's password, nearly causing a containment breach. The personnel in question reported being unable to recall parting with the information in question.//

//Furthermore, testing reveals that if a subject wears SCP-268 upwards of ten hours, its effects seem to linger on the subject even while not wearing the artifact though with diminished potency.  Testing in this area has been cautious due to the previously mentioned incident, but it is possible that if one were to wear the artifact enough times, for long enough, that the effect could be rendered permanent and unbreakable. I recommend SCP-268's immediate upgrade to Euclid class due to the dangers this poses to containment protocol//. - Dr. Klein

**Addendum 268-02:** SCP-268 is noted to have some similarities to [[[SCP-180]]].  SCP-268, however, does not seem to function on inanimate objects, and more importantly does not steal the identity of its host.  While SCP-180 causes its host to become unrecognizable after SCP-180 itself is removed and placed on another object, this seems to be a side-effect of its function of identity theft.  SCP-268's main function, on the other hand, seems to be to induce the state of being unrecognizable and thoroughly ignorable. Some note that SCP-268 seems to be a more pragmatically crafted version of SCP-180.  This has caused some speculation as to whether the items share similar origins, or whether the many similarities they share are merely coincidental.

**Addendum 268-03:** At Agent ██████'s request, and after approval by Dr. █████████ and Dr. Klein, SCP-268 is being used with agents in active field duty.  Results thus far have been favorable.

**Addendum 268-04:** Field-Testing suspended. Though an Agent ██████ appears to have been on payroll and on records, no personnel, either on site ██ or in higher command, remember knowing or hearing about an Agent ██████.

**Addendum 268-05:** As of ██/██/████, SCP-268 is missing. It's absence was discovered early in the morning by Agent ██████ and research analysts, and in its place was a note reading "Thanks, I needed my hat back. ~ L.S." A full investigation on this security breach has been launched as of ██/██/████. Refer to [DATA EXPUNGED]
