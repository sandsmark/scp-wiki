**Item #:** SCP-268
 
**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:**  
SCP-268 is currently to be maintained within [DATA EXPUNGED], as it has been deemed that the change of use for facilitation of escape by restricted personnel or humanoid SCP is too great.  However, the possibility of use by field agents after further testing is under review.
 
**Description:**
SCP-268 is a wool tweed newsboy cap, of a dull green color.  The design seems to be of Irish origin, sometime in the late 1800's to early 1900's, though fiber analysis [DATA EXPUNGED].  The only markings on the cap are a small label with writing in Middle Irish, reading "The Garden is the Serpent's Place."  There is some degree of consensus to indicate this label may have been sown on some time after the original manufacture of the cap itself, however.

Due to the nature of the artifact, testing has been difficult.  SCP-268 seems to be a normal hat until certain requirements are met.  The first and most obvious seems to be that anyone simple wearing SCP-268 becomes suddenly quite unmemorable, and tends to blend into the background.  During initial testing, it took some remote analysts upwards of ten minutes to remember what exactly they were doing, and what they were supposed to be looking at in the screen. Testing with subjects unaware of SCP-268's status has concluded that the effect seems to be even stronger when the specific purpose of analysis SCP-268's wearer was not in the mind of the test subject.  Subjects repeatedly seemed to ignore or "take for granted" those wearing SCP-268.  Subjects were later able to remember seeing "someone," but being unable to recall the features of this person; height, skin color, gender - all these details seemed to elude them.  Subjects seemed to have the overwhelming feeling that the "someone" was supposed to be there, and thus they didn't merit thought.  The "spell" seemed to become broken only if SCP-268's wearer spoke audibly.

Electronics seem to be only partially immune to SCP-268's effects; pictures of SCP-268 being worn don't develop correctly, and digital media such as surveillance cameras become grainy and unfocused.  Further testing with various electronic means is to be required, but testing so far indicates SCP-268 is extremely hard to capture while active.

This was thought to be the extent of SCP-268's abilities until Agent ██████ brought up the possibility of further testing and the possibility of SCP-268 use for field work.  During testing, other abilities were discovered.

During testing, Agent ██████ (who volunteered to be the test subject) lit a customary cigarette, and noticed this changed people's attitudes toward him.  While before, any attempt of communication by SCP-268's wearer seemed to end SCP-268's effect, it continued to hold while smoking the cigarette.  Agent ██████ reported that subjects talked to while he was smoking and wearing SCP-268 seemed to remain relaxed and calm, and respond in a friendly and dismissive manner towards him.  However, they seemed inclined to part easily with information; he was able to ask among various things, for personal passwords, middle names, home addresses, and other factual information.  Subjects remembered thinking about the information they gave out, but don't remember talking to anyone about it.

Further testing concerning SCP-268's use in conjunction with other mundane items and actions is necessary.  No one is able to predict exactly how far SCP-228's abilities may extend.
 
**Addendum 268-01:** The acquisition of SCP-268 occurred during a small raid on a Insurgency Site on ██/██/████, along with [DATA EXPUNGED].

**Addendum 268-02:** SCP-268 is noted to have many similarities to [[[SCP-180]]].  SCP-268 however, does not seem to function on inanimate objects, and more importantly does not steal the identity of its host.  While SCP-180 causes it's host to become unrecognizable after SCP-180 itself is removed and placed on another object, this seems to be a side-effect of its function of identity theft.  SCP-268 main function on the other hand seems to be to induce the state of being unrecognizable and thoroughly ignorable, and this effect is voluntary (by putting on SCP-268) as opposed to a forced effect.  Some note that SCP-268 seems to be a more pragmatically crafted version of SCP-180.  This has caused some speculation as to whether the items share similar origins, or whether the many similarities they share are merely coincidental.

**Addendum 268-03:** As of ██/██/████, only two months after SCP's acquisition of SCP-268, SCP-268 is missing.  Its absence was discovered early in the morning by Agent ██████ and research analysts, and in its place was a note reading "Thanks, I needed my hat back.  ~ L.S."  A full investigation on this security breach has been launched.
