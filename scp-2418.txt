**Item #:** SCP-2418

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** The property containing SCP-2418 is owned by a Foundation front, Shalhoub, Caldwell & Pedrotti SAE[[footnote]] A black-market antiquities dealership with connections in the Egyptian government and military; for more information see Front Company File EG-3. [[/footnote]], under the guise of a temporary storage location for artifacts being smuggled out of Egypt. At no point should more than one person enter SCP-2418, except under controlled testing conditions; testing of SCP-2418's anomalous properties requires the approval of the Site-42[[footnote]] The Foundation's primary operational hub for the Red Sea region, including North-West Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. [[/footnote]] Ethics Committee liaison. 

**Description:** SCP-2418 is an ancient nilometer[[footnote]] A well with markings along the sides, used in antiquity to measure the level of the Nile and predict the severity of its yearly floods. [[/footnote]], located in the basement level of a house in El Sheikh Ebada, a small town in southern Egypt. SCP-2418 was originally constructed in the 13th century BCE by the pharaoh Ramesses II as a part of a temple to Isis and Osiris; the most recent phase of construction dates to circa 130 AD, when the Roman city of Antinopolis was founded at the site of the older temple complex. 

SCP-2418's anomalous properties manifest when two individuals enter the water at the bottom and one of those individuals dies of asphyxiation; these individuals must be married or otherwise in a romantic relationship, close relatives (siblings or a parent and child), or close friends. The surviving individual will experience a powerful rejuvenating effect; the effects of aging will be reversed significantly, and chronic diseases—sometimes including genetic or congenital conditions—will be cured. The strength of the rejuvenating effect seems to scale proportionally with the strength of the relationship between the individuals, and inversely with the age of the deceased; in no recorded cases has an individual been rejuvenated to an apparent age of less than twenty-five.

SCP-2418 was acquired in 2011 as a part of Operation Harpocrates, a coordinated attack on Marshall, Carter & Dark assets in Egypt, during which the Foundation used a combination of physical raids, political upheaval and economic manipulation to effectively remove the presence of MC&D and associated groups from the country.

**Recovered Document 2418-1: //Cura Praetoria Sapientae Occulate// Report**
Latin, circa 130 CE. From the archives of the Vatican Office of Secrets and Prophecy. Trans. Giulia Mancini, 1987. 

> **//Nomen//:** The Well of the Divine Antinoüs 
> 
> **//Gens Rei//:** Useful
> 
> **//Descriptio//:** A well in the city of Antinopolis, in the province of Egypt, used by the priests of the Egyptians to measure the rising and falling of the Nile. Located beneath the Great Temple of Antinoüs Osiris and particularly sacred to that hero. If a man should go into the well, and certain secret rituals be performed by the priests of the temple, the man shall be restored to youth and strength, and his illnesses and frailties shall vanish, as he is blessed by Antinoüs Osiris. 
> 
> This well is currently under the care of Manius Curius Ater, //Curator Arcanorum// for Publius Aelius Hadrianus Augustus, and the priesthood of Antinoüs Osiris. Rumors of some influence of the //Forum Tenebris// in the priesthood have been investigated by Curius Ater, although he has not yet found any evidence. 
> 
> **//Acquisitio//:** With the Emperor Publius Aelius Hadrianus Augustus having once more fallen ill, the //Curator Arcanorum//, Manius Curius Ater, was tasked with finding a cure for his ailments and went into Egypt to seek the aid of the priests there, who had always been greatly respected by the Emperor. In the town of Baesa, on the Upper Nile, he found a cult of priests whose order had been established by Ozymandias the Great, and to whom Alexander and the Ptolemies had gone for wisdom and for healing. And when the Emperor was informed of these miracles, he went up the Nile to this temple, and bathed in the waters; and his illness was cured. 
> 
> **//Curatoria//:** Since, on the journey up the Nile, the Emperor's favorite Antinoüs had fallen into the river and drowned, after he had risen up into the heavens as a god, the Emperor paid for the temple and the well to be restored, and rededicated them to Antinoüs Osiris, and founded a city on the site, calling it Antinopolis in his beloved's honor. The care of the well was entrusted to the //Curator Arcanorum//, as he had been so serviceable to the Emperor and the Empire.

Notably, the CPSO were apparently unaware of the exact method of activation; see Recovered Document 2418-3 for further information.

Greek, circa 138 AD. Inscribed on a marble plaque inside the tomb of the Emperor Hadrian. Original inscription is in the Esoteric Collection of the Vatican Museum. Trans. Dietrich Von Grummet, 1965.

> Antinoüs, most beautiful, most wise,
> Forgive me, I beg of you, great god,
> For placing your life's worth below my own.
> Kings and Emperors may rise and fall,
> One not much different from the other;
> But great beauties are eternal, heavenly,
> Each one unique, each one perfection.
> And in my sickness and my hubris I,
> A mortal man allowed to touch divinity,
> Destroyed such beauty, just to save my life.
> Forgive me, I beg of you, great god,
> Antinoüs, most beautiful, most wise.
