**Item #:** SCP-3834

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3834-A through X are to be contained in separate non-humanoid holding cells at Site-37. The location of SCP-3834’s discovery is to be restricted from public access until the Foundation Archeological Division has determined the site to be free of further anomalous content.

**Description:** SCP-3834 is the collective designation of 24 phonographic records individually designated SCP-3834-A through SCP-3834-X. Instances of SCP-3834 are approximately 30.5 centimeters in diameter, and possess no physical or chemical differences from standard phonographic records. All instances of SCP-3834 were discovered within a combination locked safe unearthed during a paleontological excavation in █████████, Montana. The safe was encased in sedimentary rock approximately 760 meters below ground prior to its recovery, along with the remains of several instances of //Troodon formosus//. Radiometric dating of these remains indicates that they are between 75.5 and 77 million years old. The stone surrounding the safe displayed no signs of disruption indicative of artificial burial, suggesting that SCP-3834 was incased through natural processes. Aside from their location of discovery, SCP-3834 instances possess no inherent anomalous properties.

Instances of SCP-3834 each contain between 40 and 45 minutes of content, with degraded sound quality indicative of repeated usage. Most content contained within SCP-3834 consists of songs which were popular between the late 1950s and late 1960s, from notable artists such as The Beach Boys, Chuck Berry, and Engelbert Humperdinck. All songs contained on instances of SCP-3834 are performed by the same entity, designated SCP-3834-1. SCP-3834-1 has a voice resembling that of an adult human male, and is introduced at the beginning of each recording as Don Hartley. This name is the same as that of a traveling musician who was declared missing on ██/██/2004. Various musical instruments, including but not limited to electric guitars, bass guitars, drum sets, cellos, trumpets, and trombones, can also be heard on instances of SCP-3834.

At the start of each record, SCP-3834-1 is introduced by a separate entity, designated SCP-3834-2. SCP-3834-2 has a distinctly inhuman voice, which most closely resembles that of a canine or psittacine. Despite this, SCP-3834-2 speaks intelligible English, and generally spends between 10 and 45 seconds describing SCP-3834-1 in a positive and enthusiastic manner. Although most of these introductions focus on SCP-3834-1’s musical abilities, certain descriptions focus on other traits and past actions of SCP-3834-1. These descriptions suggest that SCP-3834-1 was a figure of great social influence at the time of their recording, and possibly a governmental or religious figure of some kind (see Addendum 3834.1).

In addition to SCP-3834-1 and SCP-3834-2, miscellaneous noises can be heard on SCP-3834 instances which suggest additional entities present during their initial recordings. These include the sounds of various musical instruments, including but not limited to electric guitars, bass guitars, drum sets, cellos, trumpets, and trombones. The sound of applause can also be heard between individual songs, along with noises resembling barking and screeching. The exact number and nature of the entities involved in the creation of SCP-3834 is currently unknown.

The being who, just a few short moons ago, emerged from his box of lightning, and gave us the gifts of fire and speech, is now here to give us his third and greatest gift yet, a little thing that he likes to call music. Now, don’t let his looks fool you, he may not have claws or a tail, but that doesn’t mean he won’t get you clappin’ and shakin’ yours! [several unintelligible clicking sounds are heard, possibly laughter] But seriously folks, a lot of hard work has gone into this show, so sit back, relax, and prepare to have your earholes blown clean off!

> 
> **SCP-3834-2:** Oh, sure, of course
> 
> **SCP-3834-1:** Thank you. Now, you all know It’s been a while since I’ve put on one of these shows, and I just thought I’d have a little heart to heart with you all for a moment. The truth is, well, the truth is I’ve been trying to go home.

> **SCP-3834-1:** Now, don’t get me wrong, it’s not that I don’t love it here. You guys are like family to me. It’s just that this isn’t what I had planned. I’ve spent all my free time since I came here trying to fix the machine, but I think it’s busted for good. I don’t think I’ll ever get to go home.

> **SCP-3834-1:** But I didn’t get on this stage tonight just to whine. I came here to tell you all that I’ve accepted my situation. If I had to do it again, I don’t think I’d want it any other way. I’ve gotten to put on these shows, and be a rock star just like I’ve always dreamed, and I got to meet all of you. You’re the ones who made this all possible, and for that, I thank you.

In honor of my tenth live performance, we’ll be playing all your favorites, plus some new ones I’ve been saving for just this occasion. So please, enjoy the show!
