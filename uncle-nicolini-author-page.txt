[[tab hi]]
hi. welcome to my author commentary section.
[[/tab]]
[[tab scp]]
__scp-3297__
you remember that doodle you made when you were 7 and you were so proud of it you showed it to all of your friends and they said it was pretty cool, but then you look at it again when you're 24 and you realize it's not that (at all, really) good? yeah, thats how i feel about this one. i wrote this because i was dealing with the death of my grandmother and i have no other coping mechanisms.
__scp-3358__
written with my friend janitor worth before they went on their spirit journey. this article isn't really either of our best work, nor am I really too proud of it, but writing it was a very fun time. this was originally going to be like some island of xmen or whatever before i got my hands on it.
__scp-3803__
conceptualized, written, and published in about an hour. technically 30 minutes but my friend wanted to photoshop an image to use in the article, and im grateful they did. my most successful coldpost.
__scp-3923__
based on my experiences in the white collar business world. god, i hate this business. anyway, yeah. compulsion effects and language. i had a lot of fun writing it because its so silly. also, everything in there are things i heard. all of it. none of it made up.
__scp-4003__
this was hell to write, but im glad i did. i spent so long researching and proofreading and writing and i was so scared to submit it until [[*user djkaktus]] essentially bullied me into submitting it. it was written with a dear irl friend and a cool online friend, both of whom aren't very active nowadays. sad times.
__scp-4299__
this article spent the longest in the oven when compared to anything else. it was rewritten 6 times. 6 times, jesus. my friend cole and i worked hard on it as a form of wish fulfillment to cure our sad boy status.
__scp-4949__
oh man. this one was wild. i approached gabe and told him 'what if dr wondertainment met dado' and then we wrote. we also wrote this FAST so we could snatch the double 49 spot because gabe really likes that number.
__scp-3879__
this one spawned my obsession with having GoI interactions, this time between WWS and Wondertainment. it also got me closer to my dear friend darkstuff, and im so glad i wrote it even though its reception wasnt the best. 
__scp-2983__
written with darkstuff. my first collab with my good bud, written because i think we need more cereal based scp.
__scp-3756__
this was written entirely around the title. just some absurdity. yeehaw, partner.
__scp-4988__
this was written about my hatred of working in a call center for a while and also the exploitation of minorities in other countries for profiteering. or whatever. plague girl got ahold of it during draftswap.
__scp-3863__
COW BEES was originally written as a rewrite of SCP-1912, which got rejected for being different. It all works out because Rimple (who is an excellent author) wanted to rewrite it, and they got it! At time of writing, it hasn't come out yet but I look forward to it. The idea came about because i found out about canulated cows. don't google that. its gross. im serious.
__scp-1712__
Roget is an an author i've always admired, and we're both Florida boys. When this article dipped into the negatives, I took a stab at rewriting it. i took the concept of 'weird shit just happens sometimes' and turned it into an scp. nothing makes sense because it doesn't have to.
__scp-3867__
so one night kirby and i were up at 1 AM talking and I jokingly brought up 'panda watch' and gave updates on whatever trivial bullshit my dog was doing. he said 'what if there was an scp that was a website that told you the last thing your pet did' and then we stayed up till like 2AM brainstorming. i woke up the next day with a draft and he signed off on it.
[[/tab]]
[[tab goi formats]]
__critter profile: maya__
this sparked my love for WWS. it was written right after 4kcon after i had gotten burned out from writing SCP and found a new love in GoI formats. it has a sister article, a herman fuller format made by my dear friend crow.
__critter profile: wobbles__
written with dr dog as an excuse to write SPC and WWS interacting. god, i love this so much its so stupid and silly. i had a great time writing this.
__The Corncrake of Destiny__
yeah man i don't know. i like dr. spanko and wanted to do something new. also team bird best team
__Caroll 055: The Workshop__
written with rockteeth who is super cute. my first foray into the chicago spirit and now suddenly everyone is doing it! anyway, this one was fun. lots of fun. rockteeth is great.
__`Phoenix √† La Mode` (KEN46/FRI98/PNX72)__
this is a WEIRD fucking article. rockteeth started writing it forever ago with someone else, then they dipped, and he approached me for a collab. it was originally close to a KFC but with MCD, to which I said 'why on earth would MCD be interested in doing anything with KFC?'
__'Para-Pedigrees' PED464/CAN33/LUP22__
listen dude i just love dogs, i love goi formats, wilsons, and mcd. what are you, a cop? 
__Fifteenth Anonymous Donation__
ah yes dado goi format using manna charitable. this is the first mcf article in 3 years (and it revived Reach!) and I mostly wrote it because I wanted to write in the EoD canon and also write an MCF article. also dado. yes. u trust dado. yes.
__Hare 023: The Cheshire Cat__
this one's a weird one. it's technically a dnd character sheet but for Nobody from the Chicago Spirit's POV. In order for it to not be a dnd character sheet I attached a psuedo-tale at the top and rounder made it look cooler. hell yeah.
__Adoption Poster: Bandit!__
name a more iconic duo than nico + wws. ill wait.

[[tab tales]]
__Cack hard__
the start of a beautiful friendship with gabriel jade. god, this was a wild romp. we started talking because he had just recorded a podcast and he said i was fun so we became pals. such a wild time.
__classy carlos goes to therapy__
written because i thought it would be funny to have two recent and popular doodle scps hash it out and be dicks to one another.
__cured hams__
im sorry. i am not sorry.
__tim wilson's close shave__
god im so annoyed this tale is only at like 32 at time of writing. i feel like its so good but im maybe biased. very biased. whatever. written because i wanted to do a close encounter type deal.
__seven days with mr. fish__
written because mendelssohn drew a lovely image of mr fish and i just wanted to use it so badly in a tale. so i wrote mr fish's eternal mortal coil. what a chad.
__Cack Hard 2: Revengeance: Reloaded__
cack hard 2: the search for more upvotes
__(Too) Late Registration__
the only OCT contest tale featuring not a single OCT contest character. ever.
__moon champion's cinco de mayo extravaganza__
halloween contest tale! written about the article that saved my life. no, seriously. the lunatic saved me from having an anxious breakdown because i laughed so hard while reading it. i love cadaver for writing it, and he's a real hero. i miss him dearly.
__i don't get it, but i'll figure it out.__
written for a trans friend of mine. i wanted her to know that even though things might not be okay now, they will be soon. i love you, if you're reading this.
__digging up the past__
playing with old author avatars is fun.
__who wants to live forever?__
see above
__the hermit, death, and the devil__
see above
__RAISA-6147 (PENDING ASSIGNMENT)__
okay so... this was the thing i got for draft swap from casponaut. i turned it into a tale because i couldnt figure out how to make it an scp.
__square your shoulders, lift your pack, and leave your friends and go.__
written for the aces and eights canon. i wanted to shove my self insert into aces and eights and now i have a cool cowgirl with a robot arm. yeehaw, pardner
__Reality TV, Designer Pets, and Fine Dining__
my first foray into writing ambrose restaurants, and Broken Masquerade. cool canon. written for holiday gift exchange as a pinch hit.
__Nobody likes having enemies__
part of the 'summer of blood' series with rounderhouse. written as a set up to MCD's beef with Chicago Spirit, and setting up nobody.
__a walk in ##green|//**the land of the nameles//**##__
written for my mentor, friend, and captain zyn as part of the holiday art exchange! i had been wanting to write something with kiryu labs for a while, and a tale set in taboo, and this gave me the perfect excuse. i ended up writing the whole thing as a dream sequence because i couldn't find a way to make it all tie in together lmao.
__Wonder World Dossier__
written because this really should have been on the wonder world canon page but darkstuff and i rushed it lmao
__"A Tale Of Petty Revenge" or, "Dr. Cimmerian microwaves a slice of unwrapped Kraft American Singles in the Site-19 break room for two minutes"__
wydness had the terrible idea of cimmerian microwaving a slice of cheese in the microwave. the rest was history. this tale was written as an excercise in absurdity.
__Persephone Project__
see abo- wait

okay so this was written because gabe and i love KPC and wanted to emulate the project olympia style. i think we did good. love u gabe

__SUMMARY__
Dr. Everwood is a snarky, grumpy person. She has short brown hair, green eyes, and looks tired most of the time. Is missing her right arm, which she lost in a [DATA EXPUNGED] incident. Doesn't like her prosthetic arm but wears it when necessary. Despite her snark and grump, she knows how to have fun and likes doing so. Identifies as female, but looks relatively androgynous and likes it that way. Born and raised in Florida. Speaks Spanish and English.

You can use her as a GoI specialist if you like, as that's what she enjoys.
Works for the UIU as a rookie agent in the Aces and Eights canon.
Lead Dr. Wondertainment researcher in Wonderful World canon.
Administrator in the canon of [[[SCP-4224]]]

__SUMMARY__
D-1221 is objectively a terrible person. Though his past is largely a mystery, we know a few things about him. His last name is 'Schieffer', and he killed his pet cat. Canonically, he dies after the events of SCP-3297 but don't let that stop you from torturing him with anything you want. Knows he's a terrible person and tried fixing it, but he fell back into old habits, ultimately landing in the Foundation as a D-Class. Idenfitifes as male.

__HOW DOES HE LIKE HIS COFFEE?__
He would kill for any form of coffee right about now, to be honest. He hasn't had caffeine in forever.

__HOW OFTEN DOES HE SWEAR__
Like a sailor.

__SUMMARY__
As a citizen of Wonder World‚Ñ¢, Holly has some unusual features. Her eyes are unnaturally large and almost cartoonish, her arms are rubbery, and her eyes change color to reflect her mood. She is the current Dr. Wondertainment in the Wonder World canon and is doing the best she can to improve the company's image following some rather disastrous years of bad leadership. She's very optimistic and always tries to look on the brighter side of things no matter the situation, even though she may not truly believe them to even be remotely possible in the long run. Identifies as female.

__HOW DOES SHE LIKE HER COFFEE?__
She likes her sugar with a dash of coffee. Yes, a dash of coffee.

__HOW OFTEN DOES SHE SWEAR?__
Dr. Wondertainment‚Ñ¢ licensed products and personnel are not permitted to swear as per article 15 of section 2 of the Wondertainment Wonder-employment contract‚Ñ¢.
