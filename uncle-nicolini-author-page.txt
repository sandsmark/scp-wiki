yeah, yeah, yeah. i get it, you miss the old author page. it may come back eventually, but --the stupidity of the 'best author page' contest-- recent events have worn me out from the whole shtick.

[[tab hi]]
hi. welcome to my author commentary section.
[[/tab]]
[[tab scp]]
__scp-3297__
you remember that doodle you made when you were 7 and you were so proud of it you showed it to all of your friends and they said it was pretty cool, but then you look at it again when you're 24 and you realize it's not that (at all, really) good? yeah, thats how i feel about this one. i wrote this because i was dealing with the death of my grandmother and i have no other coping mechanisms.
__scp-3358__
written with my friend janitor worth before they went on their spirit journey. this article isn't really either of our best work, nor am I really too proud of it, but writing it was a very fun time. this was originally going to be like some island of xmen or whatever before i got my hands on it.
__scp-3803__
conceptualized, written, and published in about an hour. technically 30 minutes but my friend wanted to photoshop an image to use in the article, and im grateful they did. my most successful coldpost.
__scp-3923__
based on my experiences in the white collar business world. god, i hate this business. anyway, yeah. compulsion effects and language. i had a lot of fun writing it because its so silly. also, everything in there are things i heard. all of it. none of it made up.
__scp-4003__
this was hell to write, but im glad i did. i spent so long researching and proofreading and writing and i was so scared to submit it until [[*user djkaktus]] essentially bullied me into submitting it. it was written with a dear irl friend and a cool online friend, both of whom aren't very active nowadays. sad times.
__scp-4299__
this article spent the longest in the oven when compared to anything else. it was rewritten 6 times. 6 times, jesus. my friend cole and i worked hard on it as a form of wish fulfillment to cure our sad boy status.
__scp-4949__
oh man. this one was wild. i approached gabe and told him 'what if dr wondertainment met dado' and then we wrote. we also wrote this FAST so we could snatch the double 49 spot because gabe really likes that number.
__scp-3879__
this one spawned my obsession with having GoI interactions, this time between WWS and Wondertainment. it also got me closer to my dear friend darkstuff, and im so glad i wrote it even though its reception wasnt the best. 
__scp-2983__
written with darkstuff. my first collab with my good bud, written because i think we need more cereal based scp.
__scp-3756__
this was written entirely around the title. just some absurdity. yeehaw, partner.
__scp-4988__
this was written about my hatred of working in a call center for a while and also the exploitation of minorities in other countries for profiteering. or whatever. plague girl got ahold of it during draftswap.
[[/tab]]
[[tab goi formats]]
__critter profile: maya__
this sparked my love for WWS. it was written right after 4kcon after i had gotten burned out from writing SCP and found a new love in GoI formats. it has a sister article, a herman fuller format made by my dear friend crow.
__critter profile: wobbles__
written with dr dog as an excuse to write SPC and WWS interacting. god, i love this so much its so stupid and silly. i had a great time writing this.
__The Corncrake of Destiny__
yeah man i don't know. i like dr. spanko and wanted to do something new. also team bird best team
__Caroll 055: The Workshop__
written with rockteeth who is super cute. my first foray into the chicago spirit and now suddenly everyone is doing it! anyway, this one was fun. lots of fun. rockteeth is great.
[[/tab]]
[[tab tales]]
__Cack hard__
the start of a beautiful friendship with gabriel jade. god, this was a wild romp. we started talking because he had just recorded a podcast and he said i was fun so we became pals. such a wild time.
__classy carlos goes to therapy__
written because i thought it would be funny to have two recent and popular doodle scps hash it out and be dicks to one another.
__cured hams__
im sorry. i am not sorry.
__tim wilson's close shave__
god im so annoyed this tale is only at like 32 at time of writing. i feel like its so good but im maybe biased. very biased. whatever. written because i wanted to do a close encounter type deal.
__seven days with mr. fish__
written because mendelssohn drew a lovely image of mr fish and i just wanted to use it so badly in a tale. so i wrote mr fish's eternal mortal coil. what a chad.
__Cack Hard 2: Revengeance: Reloaded__
cack hard 2: the search for more upvotes
__(Too) Late Registration__
the only OCT contest tale featuring not a single OCT contest character. ever.
__moon champion's cinco de mayo extravaganza__
halloween contest tale! written about the article that saved my life. no, seriously. the lunatic saved me from having an anxious breakdown because i laughed so hard while reading it. i love cadaver for writing it, and he's a real hero. i miss him dearly.
__i don't get it, but i'll figure it out.__
written for a trans friend of mine. i wanted her to know that even though things might not be okay now, they will be soon. i love you, if you're reading this.
__digging up the past__
playing with old author avatars is fun.
__who wants to live forever?__
see above
__the hermit, death, and the devil__
see above
__RAISA-6147 (PENDING ASSIGNMENT)__
okay so... this was the thing i got for draft swap from casponaut. i turned it into a tale because i couldnt figure out how to make it an scp.

in the event something happens to me and i disappear for 5 years or die, i leave all my non-colab articles entrusted to [[*user varaxous]], and all my collab articles with the respective co-authors. The only exception to this is [[[moon-champion-s-cinco-de-mayo-extravaganza|moon champion's cinco de mayo extravaganza]]], which would be left to [[*user cadavercommander]].

if i am needed for any emergency reason, [[*user mlister]] and [[*user rockteethmotheyes]] have my personal number and can contact me at any time.
