[[tab Dr. Everwood]]
__APPEARS IN__
[[module ListPages separate="no" tags="+doctor-everwood" perPage="40" prependLine="||~ Title ||~ Author ||"]]
||%%title_linked%%||%%created_by%%||
[[/module]]
__SUMMARY__
Dr. Everwood is a bright and cheerful person, despite her appearance. She has short brown hair, green eyes, and looks tired most of the time. Is missing her right arm, which she lost in a [DATA EXPUNGED] incident. Doesn't like her prosthetic arm but wears it when necessary. Despite her snark and grump, she knows how to have fun and likes doing so. Identifies as female, but looks relatively androgynous and likes it that way. Born and raised in Florida. Speaks Spanish and English.

You can use her as a GoI specialist if you like, as that's what she enjoys.
Works for the UIU as a rookie agent in the Aces and Eights canon.
Lead Dr. Wondertainment researcher in Wonderful World canon.
Administrator in the canon of [[[SCP-4224]]]

__HOW DOES SHE LIKE HER COFFEE?__
Prefers bubble tea, but if forced to drink coffee likes espresso with a little bit of sugar.
__HOW OFTEN DOES SHE SAY USE SWEARS__
Sometimes.
[[/tab]]
[[tab D-1221]]
__APPEARS IN__
* SCP-3297
* SCP-3803
* SCP-3867
* SCP-3923
* SCP-3709
* Seven Days With Mr. Fish

__SUMMARY__
D-1221 is objectively a terrible person. Though his past is largely a mystery, we know a few things about him. His last name is 'Schieffer', and he killed his pet cat. Canonically, he dies after the events of SCP-3297 but don't let that stop you from torturing him with anything you want. Knows he's a terrible person and tried fixing it, but he fell back into old habits, ultimately landing in the Foundation as a D-Class. Idenfitifes as male.

__HOW DOES HE LIKE HIS COFFEE?__
He would kill for any form of coffee right about now, to be honest. He hasn't had caffeine in forever.

__HOW OFTEN DOES HE SWEAR__
Like a sailor.

LOVINGLY MADE WITH MY FRIEND AND PAL DARKSTUFF

__SUMMARY__
Faeowyn Wilson (born Felix Wilson) is Tim Wilson's daughter and the second person to run Wilson's Wildlife Solutions. She is very intelligent and inherited her father's love for animals, but is a lot more competent and responsible than him. Is a very 'no-nonsense' person. She is tan, has shoulder length hair, brown eyes, has an athletic body type, and is often seen wearing a WWS-embroidered khaki shirt and shorts. Smells of sunscreen. Is dating fellow WWS volunteer Alex Molina.
Dislikes Marshall Carter and Dark.
Is friends with Holly 'Wondertainment' Light in Wonderful World canon.
Is aware of Three Portlands and the Wanderer's Library.

__HOW DOES SHE LIKE HER COFFEE?__
Pitch black.

__HOW OFTEN DOES SHE SWEAR?__
In front of her dad? Never. Elsewhere? depends on how angry she is.
[[/tab]]
[[tab Holly 'Dr. Wondertainment' Light]]
DISCLAIMER: This is Darkstuff's character that I have taken and ran with.
__APPEARS IN__
* And I think to myself...
* Wonder World Dossier
* SCP-3879
* Old Business

__SUMMARY__
As a citizen of Wonder World™, Holly has some unusual features. Her eyes are unnaturally large and almost cartoonish, her arms are rubbery, and her eyes change color to reflect her mood. She is the current Dr. Wondertainment in the Wonder World canon and is doing the best she can to improve the company's image following some rather disastrous years of bad leadership. She's very optimistic and always tries to look on the brighter side of things no matter the situation, even though she may not truly believe them to even be remotely possible in the long run. Identifies as female.

__HOW DOES SHE LIKE HER COFFEE?__
She likes her sugar with a dash of coffee. Yes, a dash of coffee.

__HOW OFTEN DOES SHE SWEAR?__
Dr. Wondertainment™ licensed products and personnel are not permitted to swear as per article 15 of section 2 of the Wondertainment Wonder-employment contract™.

in the event something happens to me and i disappear for 5 years or die, i leave all my non-colab articles entrusted to [[*user Varaxous]], and all my collab articles with the respective co-authors. The only exception to this is [[[moon-champion-s-cinco-de-mayo-extravaganza|moon champion's cinco de mayo extravaganza]]], which would be left to [[*user cadavercommander]].

if i am needed for any emergency reason, [[*user Varaxous]], [[*user rockteethmotheyes]], [[*user UraniumEmpire]], and [[*user dolphinslugchugger]] have my personal number and can contact me at any time.
