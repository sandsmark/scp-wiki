__re:my old author page__
yeah, yeah, yeah. i get it, you miss the old author page. it may come back eventually, but --the stupidity of the 'best author page' contest-- recent events have worn me out from the whole shtick. 

__srs bznz__
in the event something happens to me and i disappear for 5 years or die, i leave all my non-colab articles entrusted to [[*user varaxous]], and all my collab articles with the respective co-authors. The only exception to this is [[[moon-champion-s-cinco-de-mayo-extravaganza|moon champion's cinco de mayo extravaganza]]], which would be left to [[*user cadavercommander]].

if i am needed for any emergency reason, [[*user mlister]] and [[*user rockteethmotheyes]] have my personal number and can contact me at any time.
