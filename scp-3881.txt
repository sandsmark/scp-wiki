**Item #:** SCP-3881

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3881 is to be kept within a standard containment locker. No further containment procedures are necessary.

**Description:** SCP-3881 is a classic gold band style wedding ring with a few cosmetic alterations. When worn by a human being, SCP-3881 will immediately transport the wearer to an unknown location. Upon removal, the ring and the wearer will be returned to their previous position.

The location is a clearing in a forest containing a single thatched-roof house. The house is fully furnished, well maintained and shows signs of prior use. Clothing within the house presumably belonged to an adult male, shoe-size 10, with approximately five years of disuse.

SCP-3881 was discovered within a pawn shop, being pawned by a Miss Pamela Smith.

> I'm also writing this because you've been incredible. I've had so much fun falling in love with you. I remember our first date, out on the hill where we got lost in each other's eyes.
