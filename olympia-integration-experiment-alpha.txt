**Project Codename:** Olympia

**Project#:** PRJOLM-000134

**Clearance and File#:** NPF-00051473

**Head Researcher:** [[[kain pathos crow s author page|Professor K. P. Crow]]]

**Experiment Aims:**
To construct the physical body of the subject using [[[SCP-291]]].

**Materials Used:**

* The product of [[[experiment log 914 theta#toc1|Experiment 914 THETA Test 2]]].
* The product of [[[experiment log 914 theta#toc4|Experiment 914 THETA Test 5]]].
* The product of [[[experiment log 914 theta#toc8|Experiment 914 THETA Test 9]]].
* The product of [[[experiment log 914 theta#toc9|Experiment 914 THETA Test 10]]].
* The product of [[[experiment log 914 theta#toc10|Experiment 914 THETA Test 11]]].
* The product of [[[experiment log 914 theta#toc12|Experiment 914 THETA Test 13]]].

**Pre-Operation Note:**
All of the subjects have had their mental bodies removed via [[[SCP-158]]], and their physical bodies copied via [[[SCP-222]]] and put into cryo storage for later use.

All subjects were then successfully dissembled into their component parts by [[[SCP-291]]].

Several pre-integration operations were carried out under instruction by [[[SCP-542]]], to give the prime subject extra organs and enhanced physiology.

The parts that will be utilized are:

# Brain of [[[experiment log 914 theta#toc8|Experiment 914 THETA Test Subject 9]]].
# Lungs and diaphragm of [[[experiment log 914 theta#toc1|Experiment 914 THETA Test Subject 2]]].

**Integration Log:**
> **21/12/2008 1800hrs** - Integration begins.
> **21/12/2008 1847hrs** - Integration taking longer than normal.
> **21/12/2008 1904hrs** - Integration finally completed. Subject's vitals are highly elevated.
> **21/12/2008 1905hrs** - Subject displays signs of neurogenic shock.
> **21/12/2008 1906hrs** - Subjects BPM per heart exceeds one hundred and fifty (150).
> **21/12/2008 1908hrs** - Subject ceases respiration.
> **21/12/2008 1909hrs** - Subject goes into cardiac arrest.
> **21/12/2008 1911hrs** - Subject is successfully resuscitated. Breathing and heartbeat resume.
> **21/12/2008 1912hrs** - Subject goes into cardiac arrest.
> **21/12/2008 1915hrs** - Subject is successfully resuscitated. Breathing and heartbeat resume.
> **21/12/2008 1917hrs** - Subjects vitals stabilize.

**Post-Operation Note:**
//I am unsure as to what caused the subject's mild organ failure, although I think it may have been the homeostasis of the various different organs succumbing to mild shock before finally adapting to one another.//

//Also, there seems to be a vast amount of cellular activity in the subject, with the various tissues in the body system adapting to each other. The subject is looking to be greater than the sum of her parts.//
