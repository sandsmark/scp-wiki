**August 22nd,  ████**

Greg can be a jerk sometimes.  It’s nice having a roommate who is gone three quarters of the time, but he has a bad habit of just walking out with stuff.  He never steals, but sometimes he’s tossing stuff in a bag so he can fly out and to a shoot in some desert, and he just doesn’t pay attention to what he’s grabbing.  So I get up, find a note saying he got a call to fly out at 6:30 a.m. and take pictures of some town that got bombed.  Wonderful.  So I go along, getting ready for work, and my damn shoes are gone.  How the hell can you accidentally take a man’s shoes, I ask you?  They’ll never fit him, so I hope he’s got a spare set.

Left a voice mail for him, told him to send them back if he’s going to be a long time.  I wouldn’t mind normally, just those were brand new!  Last time he took something of mine, I got back pants just coated in dirt and blood from some jungle in the middle of nowhere.  I had to throw them out, they stank so bad.

Work was ok, slow as hell.  Didn’t see Jim in the office today, apparently he’s been out sick.  I’m so used to seeing him across the hall, the whole day felt off.  His desk seemed really empty too…god I hope we’re not downsizing.
