Greg can be a jerk sometimes.  It’s nice having a roommate who is gone three quarters of the time, but he has a bad habit of just walking out with stuff.  He never steals, but sometimes he’s tossing stuff in a bag so he can fly out and to a shoot in some desert, and he just doesn’t pay attention to what he’s grabbing.  So I get up, find a note saying he got a call to fly out at 6:30 a.m. and take pictures of some town that got bombed.  Wonderful.  So I go along, getting ready for work, and my damn shoes are gone.  How the hell can you accidentally take a man’s shoes, I ask you?  They’ll never fit him, so I hope he’s got a spare set.

Left a voice mail for him, told him to send them back if he’s going to be a long time.  I wouldn’t mind normally, just those were brand new!  Last time he took something of mine, I got back pants just coated in dirt and blood from some jungle in the middle of nowhere.  I had to throw them out, they stank so bad.

Work was ok, slow as hell.  Didn’t see Jim in the office today, apparently he’s been out sick.  I’m so used to seeing him across the hall, the whole day felt off.  His desk seemed really empty too…god I hope we’re not downsizing.

Came home today to a message from Greg.  Says he doesn’t have my shoes, but he’s still unpacking.  I have to wear my old pair that’s falling apart, so I was a little pissed.  Left a message for him to just keep the damn things.  I think I’m still worked up from work today, I shouldn’t take it out on him.

I came in to work, all worried that someone would notice my feet, and I find the whole office buzzing.  Apparently Jim’s house blew up.  I mean it freaking EXPLODED, just a crater left.  It was all over the news, happened some time last night I guess.  Nobody knows what happened to Jim, he might have been inside.  The cops are apparently pretty tight-lipped over it, but the word is Jim had a meth lab in his basement, and something went wrong.

What the hell?  Jim?  a METH LAB??  He could barely make coffee right!  Still…it’s not like I knew him all that well, just “that guy” at work…he has been acting really weird lately.  God…you just never can tell, can you?  They’re still looking into it, but most people think Jim was in the house.

They already cleared off his desk, can you believe it?  Can’t even let the dust settle, and the corporate gears just keep turning.  I’m going to bed, my feet hurt and I’m still just shocked
