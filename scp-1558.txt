[[/div]]

**Item #:** SCP-1558

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1558 is currently contained on a base transceiver station (BTS) mounted on a cell tower in Site 76, in a 5 m by 5 m by 35 m converted elevator shaft which must be maintained at Foundation B-Standard Faraday Integrity or higher at all times. In the event of a containment breach, Mobile Task Force Rho-14 (“Signal Crawlers”) will be activated to return SCP-1558 to a Foundation-controlled BTS.

SCP-1558-2 is to be kept at all times in a standard server room in Site 76. Access to SCP-1558-2 is limited to Level 2 personnel or above. In the event of I/O activity on SCP-1558-2’s attached hard drive, the current Site 76 Director will be automatically notified.

**Description:** SCP-1558 is an anomalous computer virus which infects GSM standard cellular network base transceiver stations. Only one instance of SCP-1558 exists at any given time and is capable of moving between base transceiver stations which its signal overlaps with.

SCP-1558 has the capability of ‘intercepting’ telephone calls placed through transceiver stations it infects and covertly replacing the audio of said calls. All calls known to be intercepted to date have fit the following criteria:
* The call must be placed by an individual in a vehicle traveling 65 km/h or greater. SCP-1558 is capable of moving between transceiver stations while maintaining interception to track the caller’s movement.
* The intended recipient of the call must be an individual the caller considers a “loved one.” The method by which this detection takes place is unknown.

SCP-1558’s substituted audio exhibits similar characteristics in every recorded instance: A two-person interaction involving a deep male voice (SCP-1558-1) and a perfect replica of the voice of the intended recipient of the call. The substituted audio demonstrates an awareness of the caller’s circumstances and relationship with the intended recipient. In each instance, SCP-1558-1 will claim to have the intended recipient of the call held at gunpoint, and will threaten to kill them unless the caller causes the vehicle they inhabit to crash.

At least ██ vehicular crashes, █ small aircraft crashes and the crash of US Airways Flight ████ (whose mid-flight intervention by the Foundation led to the discovery of SCP-1558) are known to have been caused by SCP-1558, totaling ██ casualties.

[[/div]]

SCP-1558-2 is a standard, ██████-brand 1U rack server. Upon the completion of a SCP-1558 intercepted call, a recorded audio file of said call is downloaded to SCP-1558-2’s hard drive, regardless of Internet connection or power status. The attached hard drive contains ██ audio files as of ██/██/████, currently encompassing all known SCP-1558 events.

SCP-1558-2 was recovered from the home of F████ D██████, 42, a cell systems engineer from Utica, New York, United States. D███████ had recently served a 10-year prison sentence for possession and distribution of ‘snuff films’ depicting vehicular homicides, and was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound upon discovery by Foundation operatives.

> At the time of the recording, M██████ ███████’s ████ sedan impacted oncoming traffic near mile marker 29 on Interstate 90, causing a five-car pileup, 7 deaths and 4 injuries. Audio of calls continues after impact, with the sound of fire and unidentified screams. A copy of this portion of the audio, along with many other clips from other incidents, was copied to a hidden directory on F████ D██████’s personal computer.
