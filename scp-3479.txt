**Item:** SCP-3479 

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** In addition to adapting oversight and information control measures for standard cover-up procedures, one hundred and twenty-four servers from different Foundation Sites have been assigned to reviewing all new electronic content shared on known social networks that points to a case of SCP-3479. If a new case with a high number of witnesses is detected, it will be covered, all witnesses administered B-Class amnestics (preferably, B-N6, B-N7 o B-δ0) and the affected subjects administered C-Class amnestics (preferably, C91-9 in high enough doses).

> //The Ethics Committee, the Analysis Team for SCP-3479 and this very Assembly agree that SCP-3479 is not a threat to the survival of the human species beyond the public's reaction if its very existence (and the existence of anomalies or the very Foundation) became widespread knowledge. This Assembly has decided that SCP-3479 could be compatible with the consensus reality. If it was to surpass all information containment, SCP-3479 will be deemed uncontainable and subject to the most adequate Ennui Protocol to normalize it.// - O5 Assembly, standing executive order.

**Description:** SCP-3479 is a phenomenon that has been observed throughout human history. Due to its highly subjective nature for the affected subjects, SCP-3479 had been imperceptible or assumed a fictitious perception until ubiquitous and cheap video recording systems became readily available to communities with a high population density that made the anomaly frequently observed. 

SCP-3479 can take place only when two sentient subjects with strong feelings of mutual, sincere appreciation, generally of romantic love, kiss each other for a sufficiently long amount of time. [[footnote]] This phenomenon has been observed with direct lip contact, prolonged embraces, multiple brief kisses or even during full sexual intercourse. [[/footnote]] SCP-3479 consists of the manifestation of an immediate force opposed to earthly gravity on both individuals, producing an acceleration of between 9.8 and 10 m/s^^2^^@@ @@[[footnote]] Approximately the standard acceleration due to local Earth gravity, or slightly higher in cases with observable anomalous weight "reduction" and subsequent levitation. [[/footnote]]^^,^^[[footnote]] This acceleration decays as both subjects ascend (if they do at all) and fades slowly. No SCP-3479 case has resulted in traumatic death or injury to date. The maximum recorded local altitude for affected SCP-3479 subjects is 560 metres, approximately. [[/footnote]] on both until the kiss is concluded. In other words, SCP-3479 allows two kissing lovers to "levitate", notably or discreetly ascending by no  obvious means. 

Given the highly subjective perception of this experience and its relatively brief duration, most couples do no not perceive it or interpretate it incorrectly. It has been hypothesized that this could be a form of cognitoheuristic amnesia[[footnote]] A phenomenon typical of the non-anomalous psyche. If an event is too unlikely and passing enough, the average human subject will ignore it since they will deem it impossible. [[/footnote]] related to the anomaly itself, while it could also be a case of cognitive bias. 11.1% of the couples on record came to the conclusion that the event could have happened while 0.5% found it to have happened yet chose not to mention it further due to potential social pressure and other repercussions.[[footnote]] Including the speculation on whether unknown parties may take an interest on the anomalous happenings, such as the Foundation or similar organizations. In all cases, their main motivation for silence was a fear to be separated from their couple. [[/footnote]] 

A further 0.3% attempted to communicate the event, being subsequently contained by the Foundation; all other cases failed to perceive or reporting the case to each other until an outside observer mentioned them that SCP-3479 had occurred, being also detected and contained by the Foundation.

SCP-3479 has manifested eight thousand, five hundred and twenty four times as documented in Foundation Archives. Since SCP-3479 seems to involve people of all ethnic groups, genders, nationalities and ages, it continues to occur unpredictably all over the globe. 

However, SCP-3479 does not seem to generate in all interpersonal relations that may induce it. In test samples selected from the general population, only 4.6% of all relations acknowledged to include romantic love[[footnote]] As previously defined by wide consensus of all involved experts. [[/footnote]] by impartial observers[[footnote]] Psychologists, sociologists, psychiatrist, neurologists, sexologists, memeticists and control personnel with no professional affiliation relevant to the anomaly. [[/footnote]] develop SCP-3479. Statistically, this anomaly happens three times on average during an individual human lifetime, not always with the same couple.[[footnote]] A higher prevalence has been observed in people previously involved on SCP-3479 events, be it as witnesses or affected subjects. [[/footnote]]

The two affected subjects are almost universally non-anomalous. Certain exceptional cases have been discovered where either one or both had been implicated in anomalous events and three documented cases where both were in one way or another independently anomalous.[[footnote]] Sub-safe cases, under ongoing surveillance but that have yielded no signs of special containment requirements. [[/footnote]] 

No characteristics that may be applicable to all couples or their components have been discovered. Multiple anomalous and mundane predictive procedures have been attempted, to no success. To date, there is no way to predict SCP-3479 happenings nor a complete register of all undetected cases; it has been estimated in the low millions per year by the statistics personnel of the Archive Sector of Area-08-B, world-wide.

SCP-3479 has occurred in eighty-five documented occasions between Foundation personnel members or in couples that involved at least one Foundation personnel member. 

This note became necessary because nearly seventy four percent all personnel cleared for SCP-3479 has made the mistake to think that SCP-3479 manifests in all cases of "true love", thus fearing it may have never happened to them and / or that their only chance to experience it may have passed.

This is not anomalous. It is a natural reaction. Quite a human one. No memetic anomaly in SCP-3479, just what you bring with you.

I did not want to use that term on an official document yet, as I said, I feel it became necessary. True love is a social and familial ideal, a construct that may not have to be related to reality at all. All humanity seems able to tap into this anomaly, even involuntarily, and taking it lightly by concerning ourselves with personal feelings is a waste of time. I will appreciate that this topic be closed, with no further consultations about it directed to my ward, or to my colleagues in other Site's wards.

Incidentally, I remind you that C91-9 seldom leaves any residual memories or after-feelings. You may have experienced SCP-3479 in your past and had it contained by us. You do not want to know whether you experienced it or not, or with whom; it would go against procedure and alter your normal psychological development for your troubles. 

And yes, most of those eighty-five affected people became aware of SCP-3479 eventually decided to investigate about anomalies and ended up working for the Foundation as a consequence. They all willingly took C91-9 because they know better than to be so deeply involved, so //caring// about an anomaly, no matter how intimate. We must be detached. We must be objective. 

Until the Fivers consider this sufficiently uncontainable to accept it as normal, anyways.

If you experienced it, report it. If you do not know, do not mention it. Do not let an anomaly define your lives. That is all.
