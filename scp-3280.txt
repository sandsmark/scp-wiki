||Note: Due to your clearance level, some information may be withheld or incomplete.||
**Item Number:** SCP-3280 

**Object Class:** [REDACTED]

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3280 is to remain in place at its point of origin in the defunct Johnston Labs and Pharmaceuticals Research Center, which has been seized by the Foundation. Containment Liaisons are in the process of devising long-term containment solutions for SCP-3280.

Should SCP-3280 reach the entrance to Sub-Level 2, the Site will enter a security lockdown, making entrance and egress impossible. Do note that this will also activate Blackout-Protocol: ensuring that no hazardous or sensitive information is broadcast from the Site. This will be necessary to prevent a full containment breach and failure of Third Mission (Protect) goals.

**Description:** [DATA EXPUNGED]

> The file though. Was that image even right? You've glimpsed the file previously - surely it... no. No. That cannot be right. No time to be worried about something so inane, however. You need to get in.

> The faint //drip, drip, dripping// of Nichols reminds you of his presence. Gingerly, you finger about his body, feeling for his security lanyard in the dark. It's wedged beneath him, but you're able to slide it out and detach it from the loop. Thankfully, Nichols was the type of person to scrawl their password on the underside of their clearance card, as you discover upon turning it over in your hands.

**Object ##909090|Class:** Euclid##

**Special Containment Procedures:** One D-Class personnel is to be deposited into Sub-Level 2 per week ##909090|through Subterranean Access Point Gamma.##
They are to be presented with misleading information concerning the nature of SCP-3280, and instructed to progress to the lowest level of the facility. They are to be equipped with a flashlight, as well as a security baton for self-defense. An ultra##909090|sonic transmitter is to be sewn into their clothing, which will broadcast a freq##uency capable of drawing SCP-3280 to their location upon accessing the deepest area of the sub-level. This should ##white|draw SCP-3280 away from the sub-level's entrance, ## to its preference for live prey.

Failure to contain SCP-3280 in this manner will result in the full lockdown of --Site-5--[[footnote]]Personnel are to be reminded that there is no [[[SCP-Err0r|Site-5]]].[[/footnote]] the site. MTF Iota-12 ("The Silencers") and ##909090|[[[scp-402|Tau-4 "Water, Water, Everywhere"]]] will be immediately dispatched to contain the threat. Should twelv##e hours pass without Overwatch receiving an "All Clear" from these teams, all Sites are to enact emergen##white|cy measures in preparation for an imm##inent XK-scenario.

**Description:** SCP-3280 is a sapient entity composed of a fluid physically identical to water, capable of travelling ~2.5 km/h. Non-anomalous wa##909090|ter introduced to SCP-3280 will be incorporated into its mass, and remo##ved samples prove to operate identically. At the time of its discovery, the entity was approx. 66.4 liters in volume; it is currently estimated to be ~2500 liters. 

The entity is hostile to human life. SCP-3280 will seek out humans within its vicinity, forcing its mass into open orifices. SCP-3280 is also readily absorbed through the pores. The affected experience symptoms such as loss of motor control, weakening of the micturition reflex, visual hallucinations, and abdominal pain.

SCP-##white|3280 dis##plays claustrophobic behavior, ##909090|violently expelling itself from confined spaces or containers; such as vials or test subjects. SCP-3280 will constrict its mass, lashing out in pressurized bursts exceeding 255 MPa - rendering all attempts of physical containment or transportation impossible. Wh##en not hunting living prey, SCP-3280 will attempt to exit the underground level it is currently contained within. ##909090|Thus far, SCP-3280 has been kept away from the sub-level's entrance. It is believed## that if SCP-3280 learns that it is sealed within the sub-level, it could instigate a violent response from the entity, irrevocably breaking containment.

> The roiling in your stomach becomes unbearable. You recoil backwards, away from the monitor. You drunkenly stumble, struggling against the thing inside of you, out into the hallway. The storm outside rages. Torrents of raindrops spatter across the windows. You fall against the wall, face pressed against the cool glass.
