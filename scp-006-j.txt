**Description:** SCP-006-J is a collection of insectoid creatures that researchers agree are scary as balls. We're pretty sure it's memetic, but we're sure as hell not going near these things. I think I saw a stinger on one.

**Discovery:** I'm just walking through the hallway to my room, when I look in the corner and I see SCP-006-J-█. And this thing has these gigantic fucking eyes. Just staring at me like "I'm gonna fucking eat you." And I just get the fuck out of there.

//Dr. ████████ has been promoted to Site Director.// - O5-██
