**__Failed Works:__**
* "Tools of the Tortured Artist" - Malevolent magical item with compulsion effects. Booooring.
* "Changeling Orphanage" - Too weird and incomprehensible in writing/execution.
* "The Beast Outside" - A cryptid who turned out to be a dude with a curse. Failed because the payoff was weak.
