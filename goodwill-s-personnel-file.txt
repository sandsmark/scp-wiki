**__Failed Works:__**
* "Tools of the Tortured Artist" - My first attempt at an SCP. Malevolent magical item with compulsion effects. Booooring.
* "Changeling Orphanage" - Too weird and incomprehensible in writing/execution.
* "The Beast Outside" - A generic cryptid which, TWIST, turned out to be a dude with a curse. Failed because the payoff was weak. May attempt this again someday.
