**October 28th**

"**Where. Is. She?!**"

Robert Tofflemire looked up from his cup of coffee to see the rabid, slavering form of the Goatman standing in the barn that served as Sigma-10's barracks. His fur was bloodied, and his eyes were crazed. "Jesus, what, did they make a new horror f--"

Robert's sentence was unfinished. The Goatman strode forward, grabbed Robert by the neck, and pinned him against the wall. "**You are the //only// one that I told! You are one of the only ones that knows about the Grave Bog! //What did you do with her?!//**"

Before Robert could answer, the Goatman was met with a pair of gunshots from behind. Robert heard them impact, but the Caprine Beast seemed unfazed. 

"C-can't... br..." Robert clawed at the Goatman's hand. His breath stank of rotten meat and hatred. 

"Hey, asshole!" 

The Goatman turned to find himself staring down the barrels of at least twenty guns. "I don't care that you're immortal." Nicholas Ewell gripped his gun unsteadily. "We'll fill you full of lead until you put him down."

"Is this like [[[Chapter 2 Here Comes The Bogeyman|last year]]]?" Ruby Williams hissed to February.

"No." Raymond whispered back. "He went berserk, but he wasn't thinking. I think that... this is just him when he gets mad."

The Goatman growled. The Plastic People, like usual, would be of no help. He threw Robert into the formation of firearms, who scattered.

When they got their bearings, the Goatman was gone, and a new hole occupied the roof of the barn, letting in snow and sunlight.

"Did- did he..." Raymond February stuttered. "Did he just-- did he just--"

"Are you really surprised at this point, Ray?" Ruby Williams helped Robert to his feet. "Can you breathe?"

"Yeah." Robert coughed several times. "I don't know what the hell that was ab--" His eyes widened. "Shit."

"What?" 

"I //do// know what that was about." Robert pulled up a map of the town on his tablet. "Anyone available, I'm transmitting coordinates. I think I know what happened."

--------

"A mass grave?" Alison Carol sounded incredulous. "Here?"

"Yeah." Robert adjusted his scarf-- they had broken out the winterized gear earlier than usual this year, for obvious reasons. The temperature was at 20 Fahrenheit. "Goatman explained it to me. It-- it was used for people during the 1918 Flu Pandemic. They ran out of coffins."

Alongside them, Raymond February and Joseph Grey walked. The woods made them weary-- even now, they avoided the wild pumpkins they saw, covered by snow.

"Goatman called it the Grave Bog. This place isn't exactly known for swampland." Grey frowned. "Somethin's screwy here."

"Maybe the decay of so many bodies altered the terrain?" February hazarded. "Or it could just be because Sloth's Pit is weirder than a hen with teeth."

"Might be an underground stream or something." Alison spoke this as she heard the //crunch// of ice beneath her soles. "What the--"

"We're here." 

The light around them had turned distinctly green-- sunlight was filtering in through swamp gas. The snow over the boggy ground made it look wrong-- ice cracked to reveal bubbles coming up from beneath. And towards the center of the Bog, they could make out a large hole.

"Three guesses as to what happened?" Alison walked forward.

"Giant sloth, giant cannibal sloth, giant cannibal fictional sloth." Robert strode alongside her. Underneath the ice, the ground opened into a pit containing dozens of coffins, pieces of cloth, and loose bones. Thankfully, there was no stench of flesh-- the flesh had long since rotted away. 

February muttered a prayer to himself, and stepped forward. "Why did it come here?"

Joseph frowned. "If I had to hazard a guess, it's wearing the skin of some poor soul who was buried here."

"Not just any poor soul." Robert jumped in, sifting through the bodies, flashlight on. 

February and Grey couldn't help but wince; Raymond was uncomfortable with desecration on religious grounds, while Grey just couldn't stand the sound of the bones crunching under Tofflemire's clumsy feet.

After several minutes, Robert climbed out of the hole, bearing a grave marker. He handed it to Alison to read.

"Here lies Caroline Sloth. Sister, Daughter, Mother to Never Be. Laid with her Child, Quinn. 1877-1918." Her eyes widened. "You're not saying--" 

"The Pit Sloth is wearing the body of Jackson Sloth's daughter." Robert swallowed. 

"Jesus Christ, son of a bitch." Joseph Grey rubbed the back of his head.

"He didn't mean it." February spoke to the sky, drawing an odd look from the rest of the task force. "Are you sure it took that corpse? Why not any of the others?"

"I'm sure." Robert knew why, but he felt it wasn't his place to say. "We need to find the Goatman. If he's figured out the Pit Sloth's taken it, then he needs back-up."

"Well, where would he go?" 

--------

The agents of the Plastic People wouldn't need much help finding the Goatman. He had seated himself near  a dead, barren patch of land called either the Blasted Heath, the Bone Heath, or the Hidebehind's Lair. It was said that it lived in the dead, half-felled oak tree in the center. The Goatman's back was against it.

The Hidebehind wasn't there-- it had fled, gone somewhere where the Pit Sloth couldn't get at it. It was cowardly, above all else. Dangerous when cornered, yes, but its power came from it acting out in fear. The Goatman came here because it was one of the easier-to-find landmarks in the forest, far away from his home at Koch's Hovel.

"There you are." 

The Goatman looked up. Standing over him was a disconcerting figure. Her face resembled that of Caroline Sloth-- auburn hair, pale skin, dimpled cheeks. But everything else about her was wrong. Her arms were long and furred and ended in hands with truncated fingers and long claws. Her eyes were black and beady, and, unlike Caroline, this thing wasn't pregnant. She was wearing a red bonnet with a furred trim and heavy, blue winter dress. Simple boots peeked out from beneath the hem of the dress.

"The Pit Sloth, I presume." The Goatman's hatchet formed in his hands as he stood. "I remember those clothes."

"They were a present from Father-- Christmas present, in case I didn't get out of the hospital."

Jasper hefted his ax. "You're not the real Caroline Sloth."

"And you're not the real Jasper Phineas Sloth. No matter what you tell yourself, you're just something that got that name stuck to him." She waved her arm around. "Imogen died in the collapse along with the real Jasper, Jackson is a figment of his own imagination, and like you said, I'm just wearing a corpse." She shook her head. "But even I have limits."

The Goatman flinched.

"Ah, that hit a nerve." She looked at her flat stomach-- an almost mournful look colored her face. "He wasn't even really your nephew, but you still grieve for him." She shook her head. "What kind of a name is 'Quinn' for a boy, anyway?"

"Caroline hated the name Quincy, but her beau insisted on something with a Q." The Goatman contemplated this fact.

"Do you know why I call myself the Pit Sloth?" It paced around Jasper.

The Goatman stood his ground. "When Father... when the hole formed, and everything became unreal..."

"Imogen had just had a miscarriage." The Pit Sloth sighed. "Jackson couldn't bear the thought of his little Caroline coming home and not finding their new sibling buried in a small coffin in the children's cemetery. So, he thought he would write up a sibling for her, as a Christmas present." She shook her head. "I was born instead."

She stood before Jasper. "I am the Sloth that is the Pit, the third child of Jackson Sloth. And once I am real, my family will walk beyond his town."

Jasper crossed his arms. "I can at least respect your goal. But... why everything else? Kidnappings, mutilations, the sense of terror?"

"Fear is the easiest way to spread a story around-- you know this." The Pit Sloth's mouth split into a grin that wrapped around its whole head. "And besides... it's fun."

Jasper Sloth stared at this grin-- it was the same one he had seen looking up at him from the pit just under a year ago. He began walking forward. "The loop's not your doing, is it?"

"No." The Pit Sloth shook its head. "Something's trying to keep me in."

"With good reason." The Goatman crested a nearby hill, overlooking the entire town. "The Pit is the entire reason this town is the way it is. And if you //are// the Pit, if you were to leave this town, it... would cause chaos. The entire world, being like..." He turned, taking in a view of the town from the north. He waved his hand over it. "Like this!" 

"I'm aware." The Pit Sloth smiled. "This is the best town in the world. Father thought so, and I have to agree. Despite everything that's happened in the last year-- the Black Autumn, and now me, they're just... gunning on. It's remarkable."

The Goatman took out his corncob pipe and a lighter. "This is normal for them-- strange beings in the woods, gravity reversing once a week on Main Street, the malleability of the Narrative, a secret organization watching over the town. If you were to escape, you'd inflict that on the entirety of the Midwest." He chewed on the stem of his pipe as he lit it. "Sloth's Pit can cope because it's Sloth's Pit. To everyone living here, it's //always// been like this. Anywhere else would collapse on itself."

"Maybe." The Pit Sloth started down the hill away from the Jasper. "We'll just have to see."

The Goatman walked with her. "The Plastic People aren't going to let you out."

"I'm counting on it." The Pit Sloth looked off over the Goatman's shoulder, smiling at nothing. "I know I'm a villain. But I'm the villain in a horror movie-- and more often than not, in horror films, the villain wins."

There was a long pause. A leaf fell off a tree.

"I said, 'the villain wins'."

Another leaf fell. The Pit Sloth rolled its eyes.

"Honestly, it's like you don't even read the script."

The Pit Sloth's arms emerged from a pile of snow, sweeping four Foundation agents out from it. Robert Tofflemire, Alison Carol, Joseph Grey, and Raymond February all landed at her feet.

Robert and Alison exchanged a look and a nod. Robert started applauding in a sarcastic manner. "You didn't monologue! Great job!"

"Oh, you're a quipper. Joy." The Pit Sloth shook its head. "I'm averse to outright killing, but I should have made an exception in your case."

"Quips are good for distracting." Alison Carol had stood and put her pistol to the back of the Pit Sloth's head.

"It's kind of like if Ray here started shouting Hail Marys all of the sudden." Grey's rifle was trained at her torso.

While not shouting Hail Marys, Raymond February was muttering the Lord's Prayer under his breath. The Pit Sloth flinched away from him, and he talked between verses. "Guess Laura was right. It doesn't like prayers."

The Pit Sloth flinched again. "Laura Ashbrooke should be dead."

"We've got a pair of warm bodies quartered at the Site that say otherwise." Robert pulled his own pistol. "Besides, you wouldn't kill your own creator, would you?"

It snorted. "Jackson Sloth is my progenitor. She's an adoptive mother, at best."

Robert looked at Alice, and exchanged a wink. "Well, mommy told us how to beat you." He started yelling out Standard Exorcism Prayer #23. "In the name of the Trinity, the Father, the Son, the Holy Ghost, I invoke the Archangel Micheal to banish thee."

The other agents joined in on the prayer immediately. The Pit Sloth clutched its head, growling. "That stupid story..."

"What's a horror movie villain without a weakness?" Robert asked. He stopped praying as he asked the question-- that was all the Pit Sloth needed.

It lashed out, aiming to strike through Robert's chest. He fell, and gasped as the claws hit his face, marring it and leaving behind black marks.

The other agents kept their prayers going. Robert clutched his face, grunting in pain. He managed to mumble out a few words of holy protection, enough that the Pit Sloth flinched away from striking him.

Jasper Phineas Sloth, the Goatman, coughed. "I think that you should be leaving now."

With a shake of its head, the Pit Sloth stared at Jasper. "I might not even need the movie at this rate. We'll see how this plays out." With that, a hole opened in the ground, swallowed up the Pit Sloth, and then vanished.

Alison crouched by Robert. Blood flowed from the gashes on his face. "You okay?"

"I'm fine." He winced, sitting up. "Besides, it'll go away in a bit."

"How do you mean?" The Goatman walked over, eyebrow raised.

"Working theory he has." Jospeh Grey rummaged for a first aid kit. "The Pit Sloth can't create anything original, and he thinks it extends to injuries, even fatal ones."

"Every death is a little different," Robert nodded. He pulled his hand away from his face-- it was still slick with blood. "If I'm right, it should have healed by now."

February waved the wand of a Narrative Fluctuation Detector over where the Pit Sloth stood. The readings detected the presence of a quasi-real entity within the last minute. He then waved the wand over the Goatman; his readings were only slightly stronger. "It's... almost real."

"We have to stop that movie from playing." Joseph cursed as he began applying the bandages.

"No." Robert grunted. "We make it real on our own terms. Stick to the plan."

"Stick to the-- Toff, half your face almost got taken off!" Raymond threw up his hands. "We need a Plan C or D or-"

"We're working with what we've got." Alison backed away as the bandages were applied. "We go to the midnight screening, and hit it when we can hurt it the most."

The Goatman couldn't help but smirk. The Plastic People may have tried to stick everything in boxes, but they could be competent when push came to shove. "I'd say that I'd bring popcorn, but there's probably going to be plenty at the theater."

"We'll even save you a seat." Robert offered with a half-smile.
