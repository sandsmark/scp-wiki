[[span class="h-span"]]Special Containment Procedures:[[/span]] Personnel studying SCP-4475 and SCP-4475-1 have been re-assigned to the newly-formed Project GALAXIAS (a cross-disciplinary initiative devised to better understand milk-based preternatural phenomena).

All Project GALAXIAS personnel -- including occult dairy practitioners -- are to consume 1.5 L of milk per day to maintain natural resistance against milk-based anomalies. As such, the project is to screen a strict lactose tolerance for all prospective research personnel.

Information involving human apotheosis via the manipulation of milk-based archetypes should be researched and, when possible, suppressed.

[[span class="h-span"]]Description:[[/span]] **SCP-4475** is a Class-III[[footnote]]The Clef-Moose Ontokinetics Classification System, which ranks ontokinetic capabilities into a hierarchy of intensity. Observed //Class-III// ontokinetic traits include:
* Localized manipulation of physical and thermodynamic laws;
* Localized reconfiguration of matter; and,
* Localized distortion or nullification of cause and effect.[[/footnote]] deific bovine entity with a body length of 4 km, presently located in extrasolar space.

SCP-4475 possesses 25 pairs of ungulate forelimbs -- ranging from 1.5–4 km in length -- and a single large udder of variable diameter[[footnote]]SCP-4475's interior and exterior have displayed apparent inconsistent space-time and Non-Euclidean Anatomy (or NEA), which is most present in its udder.[[/footnote]] with 49 lengthy teats. Mapping initiatives have detected a large internal bladder and between 5 and 7 powerful sphincters,[[footnote]]Due to distortion caused by propulsion reactions, the exact number has not been determined.[[/footnote]] located at the rear of its body. Within the bladder, a complex metabolic process produces biochemical propellant. This propellant is expelled through one of its five sphincters. Based on this anatomical configuration, Foundation-employed aerospace engineers estimate that velocities upwards of 4,000 m/s (14,000 km/h) can be achieved in the vacuum of space.

Collected Thaumic Gateway[[footnote]]Thaumic Gateway: a para-technological machine that uses a set of complex thaumaturgic rituals to generate and sustain a stable portal (known in the paranormal community as a "Way"). The Thaumic Gateway facilitates an array of instant communication methods through each created Way, including short-wave radio band and 5G Wi-Fi fields. See Dr. Tilda David Moose (2016). [[[another-goddamn-magic-system|Magic Orientation (or, Another Goddamn Magic System)]]]. //SCP Foundation Journal of Unified Thaumatology//, 10–33.[[/footnote]]  and telemetry data have determined that SCP-4475 is presently located at a distance of 1,344 light-years (± 20 ly) from Earth. SCP-4475 is in orbit around the Trapezium Cluster -- a system of five main stars orbiting an unregistered supermassive gravitational anomaly[[footnote]]Presumed to be a black hole >100 solar masses in size.[[/footnote]] -- and is believed to have originated in the nearby Orion Nebula. 

Despite the high level of para-technology required to directly observe SCP-4475, the Foundation and Global Occult Coalition each became aware of its existence independently. Starting in 2009, at least 5,900 different persons on Earth have undergone physical teleportation into the interior of SCP-4475's mammary glands.

Though random in nature, both firsthand eyewitness accounts and audiovisual recordings from dairy ranchers corroborate the existence of a complex ritual (designated **SCP-4475-1**) capable of triggering the phenomena. The following process -- as compiled by abducted dairy ranchers for scientific study -- is a baseline for teleportation via SCP-4475-1:
# Select and secure a cow.
# Vocalize praise for its existence.
# Approach the selected cow at a 55° angle in the direction of its posterior.
# Lubricate its two rear quarters, preferably with udder cream.
# Pull on each teat five times.

Following the ritual, immediate disappearance and re-emergence inside SCP-4475's udder has occurred in all cases. Additionally, this ritual is akin to common anomalous dairy evocation practices, suggesting a link between the two phenomena.

In all observed SCP-4475-1 cases, subjects lose their memory of the scenario within 10 hours of returning, suggesting a latent amnestic property of SCP-4475 milk secretions.

Most surviving persons having undergone SCP-4475-1[[footnote]]Most of whom have been successfully contained.[[/footnote]] are later diagnosed with degenerative neurological disorders. Identified diagnoses include brain cancer, dementia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (or ALS), and brain death after the spinal fluid transforms into milk. All diagnosed persons have experienced loss of life anywhere from three weeks to ten years after diagnosis.

[[span class="h-span"]]RECOVERY NOTE:[[/span]] The following is the earliest known recorded instance of SCP-4475-1 teleportation. Timothy Wickman (**PoI-4475-01**) recorded the following on his camcorder and was later discovered incoherent in the middle of a Wisconsin, USA intersection. Witnesses described him appearing in the middle of the road and regurgitating a large pink-red biological mass.

The only information the tactical response team gleaned from Wickman was his strong desire to "return to the womb."

[[span class="h-span"]]ARCHIVIST'S NOTE:[[/span]] All building architecture inside of SCP-4475 appears to have been hewn from bone and cartilaginous tissue.

**[**//The murals depict 25 entities in a five-by-five formation. Each entity is a nude humanoid with iridescent full-body tattoos and malformed serpentine necks. The view blurs, then resolves, now focusing on a featureless placid green face with five intersecting lines on the forehead.//**]**

**TIMOTHY:** What.

**[**//Timothy moves to the next wall to the right and stops again. This wall depicts thick black smoke and Thaumaturgical Runes.[[footnote]]Identified rune designs are like those used in the summoning of eschatological entities.[[/footnote]] The wall depicts the same group; this time, they migrate into a dark tunnel. Each entity holds baskets on their heads, while smaller serpentine-headed children hug their hips. A single long umbilical cord wraps around each humanoid's shoulder and the body, terminating inside the cave.//**]**

**[**//Distant sloshing. Timothy appears not to notice.//**]**

**[**//Timothy keeps moving, this time taking little care to review the next inscriptions.

Recent SCP-4475-1 test results have trended toward increasing abnormalities; as such, persons returning from SCP-4475 more frequently reported experiencing the following:
* Traumatic spiritual experiences;
* Affliction with memory retention abnormalities, ranging anywhere between permanent amnestic fugue states and hypermnesia;
* Recall of memories foreign to themselves; or,
* Recall of memories foreign to humanity.

The triggers are increasingly commonplace milking procedures, which lead to escalating milk-based anomalies. Recovered ranchers show significant transfiguration to their skeletal structure.

Efforts to construct autonomous surveillance of SCP-4475's interior and exterior are underway. Discussion on its neutralization is pending.

Each selected personnel possesses Level 4 knowledge of SCP-4475-1's effects -- including its danger to human neurology and well-being. Due to Alpha's specialized field and occult knowledge, as well as his high memetic retention and cognitohazardous resistance, he was chosen to lead this mission.

4. [[span class="h-span" style="text-decoration: underline;"]]EQUIPMENT[[/span]] CRIMSON COWBELL personnel charged with SCP-4475 exploration have been granted the following equipment and materials:
* Three pressurized VISTA-Type Extravehicular Mobility Unit support suits, each outfitted with a SCRAMBLE headset[[footnote]]Which provides audiovisual recording and memetihazard filtering.[[/footnote]] and 30 hours of oxygen.
* A single Thaumic Gateway device powered via portable generator -- to allow instantaneous communication to and from the Operations Command. Due to its large mass and physical dimensions, the use of a Marlowe Anti-Gravitational Repulsion Sled is essential in allowing simple transportation of the device.
* The microcomputer processor, hull, and power plant for five autonomous telemetry drones will be deployed alongside the CRIMSON COWBELL team.

Between September 22 and October 10, Project GALAXIAS manned 28 excursions into SCP-4475 with the sole purpose of plotting a route into the lower bound of one of its 200 m long teats. Each associated rancher readily pledged under a Foundation-authorized geas[[footnote]]A memetic command imposed on any willing person. Modern geas technology allows persons to set up and follow specific subconscious binding contracts to facilitate easy and direct co-operation between other persons or established groups.[[/footnote]] to fulfill their duty. This allowed them to better map a navigable route through the teat before the onset of memetihazardous effects and/or inexplicable SCP-4475-1 teleportation back.

5. [[span class="h-span" style="text-decoration: underline;"]]MISSION DESCRIPTION[[/span]] Undergo a direct and extensive study of the interior and exterior of SCP-4475 and its surroundings for future physical containment. This is to facilitate sister operation FOR WHOM THE COWBELL TOLLS, designed to enact said containment with extreme prejudice under threat of neutralization.

----
At around 0507 hours (UTC+5:30), the team completed SCP-4475-1 and disappeared.

At 0520 hours, COMMAND confirmed visualization of SCP-4475's interior through all three feeds. 

At 0533 hours, the team met at a designated rendezvous point. GAMMA parked the Repulsion sled in an open chamber and programmed the Thaumic Gateway to open periodically and transmit the team's collected data. The team activated and released the telemetry drones, which dispersed. One drone flew down a path leading to the chosen teat, and the team followed far behind.

The team traveled down a long subterranean biological tunnel, next to a temple structure like that seen in [[span class="h-span"]]Recovery Log 4475.2[[/span]]. 

At 0704 hours, ALPHA reported hearing distant bovine vocalization and ordered the team to a halt. After perceiving no threat, they reconvened -- with ALPHA at the lead -- and traveled unabated for 3 hours.

At 1021 hours, ALPHA reached the teat's upper span, discovering the lifeless body of a ranch-hand; their ID tags identified them as one Darien Meyer. COMMAND claimed that Meyer exited SCP-4475 one month ago and was presently employed by the Foundation with Class-E personnel classification. ALPHA continued.

At 1025 hours, BETA discovered an enamel statue of a feminine humanoid entity with bovine characteristics. BETA noticed warped holes resembling those found in osteoporosis patients. She scraped off a sample of pink residue, revealing porous bone marrow beneath.

While taking the sample, the tunnel's muscle-lined walls contracted and constricted. BETA hastened her sample collection. At once, the flesh ruptured, from which acidic stomach fluid, pus, blood, and milk flooded the chamber. In a panic, the team jumped into a nearby crevasse, falling an estimated 20 meters onto a soft-padded biological chamber floor. 

After a brief respite, ALPHA noticed GAMMA's VISTA-Type suit slumped over and still. Upon closer inspection, the helmets' glass view-visor appeared shattered, and GAMMA's body was not found within. ALPHA marked her as Missing In Action, but BETA's biometric radar indicated that GAMMA now existed in two separate locations -- 5 m behind and 6 m beneath them, simultaneously.

COMMAND confirmed the signals matched a 99.6% biometric reading of GAMMA and reported the irregularity to the Director of Project GALAXIAS. Awaiting a response, COMMAND ordered the team to remain in place. 

Around 1031 hours, the headset of each "GAMMA" instance activated, vocalizing: "DISAVOWED DEATH FORBIDDEN."

ALPHA noticed a star-shaped crevice glowing neon pink, illuminating the crevasse beneath. Against COMMAND's order and in an attempt to aid the "correct" GAMMA, ALPHA escaped into the hole. In an audio communication with BETA, he described feeling symptoms of dizziness and dehydration and ordered her to follow him. She denied, remaining with GAMMA's vacant suit, where she stayed for the rest of the operation.

At 1034 hours, ALPHA's visual relay depicted a struggle as he fell quickly through a translucent milk flow.

At around 1035 hours, the Director of Project GALAXIAS responded, ordering COMMAND to hasten the operation. An argument erupted in the COMMAND control room over whether they should halt the operation prematurely.

Soon after, large amounts of milk flooded into the control room from an unknown source. ALPHA's vitals were detected at the back of the operations theater, contradicting his presence within SCP-4475. COMMAND dispatched an armed security team to investigate. 

Other personnel -- who were attempting to escape -- discovered that all egress doors had been pasted shut with a curdled milk substance. COMMAND alerted local emergency Mobile Task Force at once.

At 1038 hours, ALPHA ejected through the teat cistern into the vacuum of space at 14 m/s. Despite his velocity, ALPHA jolted to a stop, 1.6 km from SCP-4475. His footage depicted the two distant stars Orionis A and B in his periphery, as well as a hereto accounted for stellar abnormality ahead. The abnormality -- presumed to be the aforementioned supermassive gravitational anomaly at the center of the cluster -- emitted jets of EM radiation in each cardinal direction.

ALPHA made note of a large number of deceased human and proto-human organisms in the vicinity of SCP-4475. Autonomous optical monitoring via nearby telemetry drone detected around 450,000 total entities.

At 1045 hours, ALPHA's in-suit sensor suite detected a space-time abnormality and subsequent burst of directed electromagnetic field (or EMF) radiation. The EMF energy, focused in a wide multi-colored beam filling his entire view, traveled at ~3 AU per second in his direction -- around 1,500 times the speed of light. 

20 seconds later, the EMF beam enveloped SCP-4475, and ALPHA and BETA's telecommunications -- as well as all five drones -- went offline. 

At 1046 hours, the emergency MTF arrived at the building and struggled to force open the front egress door. Personnel suffocated as the flow of milk in the observation theater reached a height of ~3 meters. 

Eventually, the MTF breached the lobby, through which several hundred liters of milk escaped. Altogether, 12 personnel were found deceased, trapped within the main observation theater.

[[span class="h-span" style="text-decoration: underline;"]]AFTER ACTION REPORT[[/span]] While assessing CRIMSON COWBELL and the events therein, COMMAND discovered that at 1045 hours, every electronic device in both the operations theater and SCP&D farm had received an identical foreign transmission. As translated from base-2 numerals, the message reads: "SAFE AND SOUND."

As well, analysts reviewed ALPHA's final transmission and reached a consensus on the sequence of events. It is now believed that due to an unknown spatiotemporal event, the directed EMF radiation caused the aforementioned electromagnetic anomaly detected on November 19, 2034 -- some 327 days prior.

After evacuating the observation theater, security personnel detained the apparent duplicate of ALPHA and inspected it for abnormalities. No superficial anomalies were detected. The subject leaked milk and smiled.

[[span class="h-span"]]UPDATE -- OCTOBER 13, 2035:[[/span]] In the wake of Operation: CRIMSON COWBELL, no further SCP-4475-1 teleportation appears functional. With no known means of accessing SCP-4475 and a current lack of efficient superluminal transportation, all further SCP-4475 study has been placed under indefinite hiatus.

The captured ALPHA duplicate (designated **SCP-4475-A**) relayed the following message to Project GALAXIAS personnel in written Ortothan Extraterrestrial Language (or OEL):

At present, SCP-4475-A has been placed in Class-II (Limited Containment) custody. An investigation into known [[[fifthist-hub|Fifthist]]] and [[[second-hytoth-hub|Church of the Second Hytoth]]] sects for information relating to the "Fifth Church of Hytoth" is now underway.

[[span class="h-span"]]UPDATE -- OCTOBER 19, 2035:[[/span]] An autonomous probe operated by Simurgh.aic discovered a large bovine organism -- similar in appearance to SCP-4475 -- traveling through the Kuiper belt on a vector toward the inner solar system.

In co-operation with the Solar System Oversight Department, Project GALAXIAS is taking preventive measures and has moved in to investigate.
