**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5517 is to be locked inside a sealed structure 15 m tall and under the guise of a local environmental service building. A security camera is to monitor the growth of new SCP-5517-1 instances, and incendiary weapons are to be used to prevent their maturation.

Additionally, costotomes[[footnote]]A surgical instrument usually used for cutting the ribs and opening the thoracic cavity.[[/footnote]] are to be used to remove excessive material from SCP-5517 whenever necessary, which is to be sent to Site-66 for study. Personnel responsible for this procedure must wear biohazard protection suits at all times. Any individual that comes in direct physical contact with an SCP-5517-1 instance is to be immediately isolated. A medical examination will determine the proper measures to be taken, possibly resulting in termination.

Semiannually[[footnote]]Occurring twice a year.[[/footnote]], a Class D personnel is to be exposed to an instance of SCP-5517-1. The affected individual is to be allowed to proceed with its anomalous behavior while escorted by a security team provided with standard equipment.

**Description:** SCP-5517 is a pale tree of unknown species. Its outer structure is mostly made of collagen fibers and calcium phosphate. The interior presents an amalgam of ordinary human cells, tissues, and organs, including: neurons, hormone-producing glands, and bronchioles.

Organisms visually similar to leaves, designated SCP-5517-1, will periodically grow and detach from SCP-5517. These organisms are 6 cm long and scarlet in color. They have simple circulatory systems composed exclusively of erythrocytes[[footnote]]Commonly known as red blood cells.[[/footnote]]. They also have rudimentary muscle fibers, which make them capable to control gliding movements through the air. SCP-5517-1 specimens demonstrate no interest in animals other than human beings and will cease all movement 48 hours after full maturation, but will maintain the hazardous properties until biodegradation. Analysis indicate the DNA of SCP-5517 and SCP-5517-1 specimens to belong to a single human female.

SCP-5517-1 will attempt physical contact to human individuals when possible. If successful, the organism will attach to the subject epidermis and will immediately start to merge with the tissue, causing severe pain and temporary paralysis. The affected individual, known as SCP-5517-2, will then engage in a singular behavior[[footnote]]See Experiment 5517/EX.07 for further details.[[/footnote]] and will react aggressively to any attempt to hinder its progression. Incendiary weapons have proven to be an effective countermeasure to SCP-5517-2 instances, as they present unnatural resilience to physical damage.

**Discovery:** SCP-5517 is located inside a natural reserve in the municipality of Maricá, state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Following a series of missing persons cases of hikers and local residents, an investigation by the local police led to the discovery of the anomaly in 1995, and to the eventual intervention by the Foundation in the same year.

**Experiment Log:**

> **<Experiment 5517/EX.01>**
> 
> **Conditions:** Isolated environment.
> 
> **Preface:** Test subject (D-1058) was exposed to a specimen of SCP-5517-1.
> 
> **Observation Notes:** Subject presented no signs of physical alteration. However, D-1058's behavioral patterns changed notably, his mannerisms coinciding with an individual of very advanced age. Attempts to communicate have resulted in failure, as the individual maintained a fixated stare to the camera, and subsequently proceeded to strike it with it's forehead repeatedly. Further results inconclusive, subject incinerated.

> **Conditions:** Isolated environment.
> 
> **Preface:** Test subjects (D-623 / D-955 / D-1337) exposed to ten instances of SCP-5517-1.
> 
> **Observation Notes:** Instances of SCP-5517-1 pursue a single subject, successfully making it its host. D-955, now designated SCP-5517-2, proceeds to assault and kill the other two subjects. Further results inconclusive, subjects incinerated.

> 
> **<Experiment 5517/EX.07>**
> 
> **Conditions:** Open environment, 20 m from SCP-5517.
> 
>  **Preface:** Test subject (D-854) was exposed to a specimen of SCP-5517-1. Subject was observed from a safe distance by a team of armed personnel, equipped with hazmat suits and incendiary ammunition.
> 
>  **Observation Notes:** Typical behavioral alteration confirmed. SCP-5517-2 starts to follow a linear path through the vegetation while escorted by the supervising team. It then arrives at an abandoned cabin 7 km from the starting point. 
> 
> While inside, SCP-5517-2 uses an old cleaver to mutilate its own body, and to harvest a number of organs. It should be noted that SCP-5517-2 displayed no signs of pain during the process, nor did it had its motor functions impaired, even though it was visually confirmed to have removed vital organs from the thoracic cavity. Then, after SCP-5517-2 engaged in a number of culinary practices using the collected material, the entity finally placed the organs inside its thorax and sutured the opening. 
> 
> Subsequently, as SCP-5517-2 unexpectedly darted from the front door, Agent Miguel ████, who was recording the entity from an unsafe distance, was attacked. Agent ████ expired from 52 stab wounds. The video camera was damaged in the process, but the experiment was ordered to continue for the sake of data collection. See Interview 5517/IN.01 for further details.

**Inventory:** Notable items collected from the cabin.

[[collapsible show="► ACCESS INVENTORY" hide="▼ ACCESS GRANTED"]]

||~ ITEM ||~ DESCRIPTION ||
||= **#1** ||< On old cleaver. DNA from several individuals have been identified. ||
||= **#2** ||< A glass cylinder containing 43 specimens of SCP-5517-1 and an unidentified yellow liquid. Specimens were found alive and active.||
||= **#3** ||< A ceremonial dagger depicting a series of unknown symbols. ||
||= **#4** ||< A picture of a middle-aged woman and a baby. The infant presents a number of deformations, the most apparent being the presence of an appendage similar to a proboscis located in the head. The back of the picture displays the words ''Lúcia Lebedev e seu pequeno anjo''.[[footnote]]Translated from Portuguese to ''Lúcia Lebedev and her little angel''[[/footnote]] ||
||= **#5** ||< A gravestone. See the inscriptions below. ||
||= **#6** ||< An ornamented urn containing a yellow substance. The same substance was found in item #2. ||
||= **#7** ||< A humanoid skeleton. DNA analysis indicate it to be from an adult male. However, structural examination presents a number of inconsistencies to the human anatomy, such as a 20 cm tail, a third ocular orifice located in the forehead, and six-digit hands. Location of elements suggests decapitation. ||
||= **#8** ||< An oversized cradle, seemingly made from the local flora. ||

**Interview 5517/IN.01:**

[[collapsible show="► PLEASE INPUT LEVEL 4 SECURITY CREDENTIALS" hide="▼ CREDENTIALS ACCEPTED"]]

> **<Interview 5517/IN.01>**
> 
> **Date:** 08/19/1995.
> 
> **Interviewer:** Dr. Bernard Hale.
> 
> **Interviewee:** Elijah ████████, team leader of Security Team A09.
> 
> **Subject:** Observation of D-854.
> 
> ----
> 
> || **<BEGIN INTERVIEW>** ||
> 
> **Dr. Bernard Hale:** I understand that you requested the use of amnestics after your experience, yes?
> 
> **Elijah ████████:** Correct.
> 
> **Dr. Bernard Hale:** Before we can grant you that, I ask from you an exhaustive description of the events.
> 
> **Elijah ████████:** The whole thing? 
> 
> **Dr. Bernard Hale:** Just following the death of Miguel ████. We had no feed from that point on.
> 
> **Elijah ████████:** Well, it all happened pretty fast after that. We followed the target to a grotto near the base of a hill. He was walking in a much faster pace too, you would think that taking his fuckin guts out would slow him down. If anything, he seemed to be in a hurry.
> 
> **Dr. Bernard Hale:** Was he carrying anything?
> 
> **Elijah ████████:** Just a knife. I believe he had all he needed inside his chest. He cooked himself pretty good, doc. I will be damned, I swear that he even added some sauce in there. 
> 
> **Dr. Bernard Hale:** For what purpose did SCP-5517-2 do that? I ask for you to be objective.
> 
> **Elijah ████████:** Look, you may know a lot, but seeing these things up close is quite the different matter. He entered the cave, and we followed in, ten seconds later. Visibility wasn't the best inside, but we had the flames and a couple of lights as well. Also the path was quite linear, so we had no trouble navigating. It took around one hour before we started seeing the fleshy stuff all around. The roots, or hands, I guess they're both things at the same time. But they didn't move, they just stood there.
> 
> **Dr. Bernard Hale:** Your team was approaching the coordinates of 5517.
> 
> **Elijah ████████:** That's correct. Not sure how recon didn't find this big ass cave system in a two month operation. But I can say that it was pretty uneventful all the way.
> 
> **Dr. Bernard Hale:** And so you arrived at the target's location.
> 
> **Elijah ████████:** We kept a good distance from it. Omar saw it first, the target was kneeled at the top of a log staircase leading to a huge chamber. It was pitch black in there, but he didn't mind our flashlights. He was lifting his hands above the head, as if offering something.
> 
> **Dr. Bernard Hale:** The target was stationary. So SCP-5517-2 was waiting?
> 
> **Elijah ████████:** For about three minutes. Then, this massive hand comes out of the dark. I guess he was really hungry, cause this thing grabbed our target whole and gave it a good bite. Took the upper half of his torso away. We saw the face of D-854 right then and there, the bastard was laughing his tits off while being chewed on.
> 
> **Dr. Bernard Hale:** Can you describe this new entity? 
> 
> **Elijah ████████:** We let the scene cool off for a little, then we decided to move a bit closer to take a better look. That thing must be around twenty meters long. The first thing that came to my mind was a giant frog, but it had a trunk too. I say it's definitely humanoid...
> 
> **Dr. Bernard Hale:** And?
> 
> **Elijah ████████:** [pause]
> 
> **Dr. Bernard Hale:** Agent.
> 
> **Elijah ████████:** You know the hand-like roots we saw before? they were all around this thing, covering a good bit of his body. In fact, they were rocking it, doc, and there was humming too. At first, I was under the impression to be looking at one of those weird surrealist sculptures, you know? But then reality punched me in the face, this thing is alive. You tell me to avoid being subjective during this interview, but my gut told me that I was looking to a baby right there. I don't care about what the boys will tell you. That is baby, an ugly-ass baby, but one all the same. Now you smart people do your job, figure this whole thing out. Me? I want this out of my head, I just want to wake up and pretend that I'm babysitting a tree again.

**SCP-5517-3:**

[[collapsible show="► PLEASE INPUT LEVEL 4 SECURITY CREDENTIALS" hide="▼ CREDENTIALS ACCEPTED"]]

> || **SCP-5517-3** ||
> 
> **Description:** SCP-5517-3 is a humanoid organism located in a chamber underground, 42 m below SCP-5517. It has 18 m of height and resembles a human infant. However, the entity also presents singular characteristics: a 2 m proboscis which is located above the oral cavity, thick skin similar to crocodilian hide, and six-digit hands. SCP-5517-3 feeds exclusively of SCP-5517-2 instances, and remains in a hibernation state when unattended.
> 
> ----
> 
> **Addendum 5517/AD.01:** In 1996, it was discovered that SCP-5517-3 shares genetic material with both SCP-5517 and Inventory Item #7. Additionally, efforts to remove SCP-5517-3 from SCP-5517's appendages have resulted in extreme aggressive behavior and lost of ██ personnel.
> 
> **Addendum 5517/AD.03:** After five years of containment, SCP-5517-3 has entered an agitated state and is progressively manifesting physical symptoms of malnutrition. Attempts to offer alternatives of nourishment have failed, as have the attempts to replicate SCP-5517-2's culinary methods. Request to temporarily use Class D personnel in creating SCP-5517-2 instances to pacify SCP-5517-3 --pending approval.-- accepted. Item #5517's Special Containment Procedures updated.
