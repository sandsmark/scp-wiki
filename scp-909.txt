**Item #:** SCP-909

**Object Class:** **Primary Classification:** Pending **Secondary Classification:** Safe/Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** All instances of SCP-909-XX are to be kept in Hall ██ of Site ██. Please see each instance's description for specific Containment Procedures. Personnel are to report to O5-11 any persons calling themselves "Dr. ███████".

**Description:** SCP-909 is an entity or entities creating or transporting a series of anomalous humanoids (designated SCP-909-XX) with the words "Little Misters ® by Dr. ███████" printed on each instance. All humanoids discovered are sentient --and masculine in design-- (see Document 909-a). None of the contained instances show a memory before coming into Foundation custody.

Instances of SCP-909-XX have not been retrieved by Foundation Personnel. Instead, each instance has been found at the [EXPUNGED] entrance of Site ██. No other pattern has been detected in SCP-909-XX appearances.


**Addendum 909-1:** Instances of SCP-909-XX:

**Object Class:** Safe

**Containment Procedures:** SCP-909-01 is to be contained in a six (6) m x six (6) m x three (3) m containment cell, painted matte black. This cell is to be devoid of any mirrors or windows. Two LED arrays are to be installed in cells housing SCP-909-01. Every four hours, SCP-909-01 is to be fed for twenty (20) minutes. 

**Description:** SCP-909-01 is a sentient entity composed of photons. These photons form a humanoid shape that has been described as “fuzzy, but definite”. It is roughly 1.75 m tall, however its mass is immeasurable. SCP-909-01 has shown the ability to speak through the manipulation of air particles, but its mechanism to perform this is unknown.

Due to SCP-909-01's photonic nature, it is unable to manipulate solid objects aside from emitting weak electromagnetic radiation. Solids such as doors must be moved for SCP-909-01 before it can leave or enter a room.

SCP-909-01 has the ability to pass through windows and other transparent objects. The photons SCP-909-01 is composed of follow the usual laws of probability in this case, and will reflect back from the transparent object at a rate of ~5%, separating any reflected photon from SCP-909-01's influence. SCP-909-01 describes this as painful but bearable.

SCP-909-01 sheds its photons at a constant rate of approximately 0.001% of its body volume per second. These photons are emitted at a wavelength of ~380 nm to ~780 nm, or within the human spectrum of visible light. SCP-909-01 shows the ability to change the wavelengths emitted to match its background. SCP-909-01's lack of a shadow can make detecting SCP-909-01 while hidden problematic.

SCP-909-01 shows an inability to absorb coloured lights. Due to SCP-909-01's constant loss of photons, SCP-909-01 must be "fed" regularly in order to maintain a "healthy" body volume. 

Conversely, “feeding” SCP-909-01 too large an amount of photons causes SCP-909-01 to experience an over-saturation. SCP-909-01 finds this extremely painful, and describes it in a similar manner to human burns. Placing a mirror near SCP-909-01 in an attempt to "feed" SCP-909-01 its own emissions results in SCP-909-01 expressing extreme discomfort. When questioned, SCP-909-01 replied, “Would you enjoy eating your own [EXPLETIVE RECATED]?”

**Addendum 909-01-1:** The words "Mr. Chameleon, from Little Misters ® by Dr. ███████" are printed upon SCP-909-01's left "calf". SCP-909-01 shows an inability to change the wavelength emitted by this print.[[/collapsible]]

[[/div]]

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Containment Procedures:** SCP-909-02 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell. No writing materials are to be allowed inside the cell. A short summary of SCP-909-02's current situation is to be pasted on the wall beside the bed. Extras are to be provided if the previous summary is removed by SCP-909-02. SCP-909-02 is to be fed three times daily with any peanut-free meal. If SCP-909-02 is seen attempting to write or draw, he is to be incapacitated through non-lethal means.

Currently experimentation with SCP-909-02's effects has been discontinued, due to risk of containment breach. Research may be conducted if the current Site Director's approval is given.

**Description:** SCP-909-02 appears to be a young-adult Caucasian male suffering from permanent anterograde amnesia. SCP-909-02 seems to be aware of his condition but cannot recall experiences past this, aside from memories gained due to SCP-909-02's effects.

SCP-909-02's  anomalous effects become apparent when SCP-909-02 writes down any of the experiences still in SCP-909-02's working memory. These experiences immediately enter SCP-909-02's long term memory. However, the experience disappears from the memory of all other persons involved.

SCP-909-02 is allergic to peanuts and will go into anaphylactic shock following the ingestion of any peanut products.

**Addendum 909-02-01:** The words "Mr. Forgetful, from Little Misters ® by Dr. ███████" are tattooed upon SCP-909-02's right calf. Upon discovery SCP-909-02 had been wearing a 3-piece suit with the brand name "Doctor's Orders" sewn into the tag. Foundation personnel have yet to find a clothing company operating under this name.

**Addendum 909-02-02:** Further examination of SCP-909-02's clothing revealed a list of other possible instances of SCP-909 (See Document 909-a) inside the left pants' pocket.

**Addendum 909-02-3:** Interview Log

> **Interviewed:** SCP-909-02
> 
> **Interviewer:** Dr. ████████
> 
> **Foreword:** SCP-909-02 was put into initial observation for seven hours, during which the subject's anterograde amnesia and relation to SCP-909 was discovered. SCP-909-02 was then taken in for interview.

> 
> **Dr. ████████:** Ok, let's try something else. Write down what I just told you.
> 
> **SCP-909-02:** Alright. (SCP-MMM accepts the pen and stationary and proceeds to write down the information given)
> 
> NOTE: Later investigation of Dr. ████████'s notes showed that he had planned to press the button previously mentioned at this point.
>  
> **Dr. ████████:** (Brief pause) Hey, who are you?
> 
> **SCP-909-02:** I'm the, uh, SCP under your custody. Don't you remember?
> 
> **Dr. ████████:** Huh?
> 
> **SCP-909-02:** Don't you remember?
> 
> **Dr. ████████:** No. Where am I? What is this place?
> 
> **<End Log>**
> 
> **Closing Statement:** Dr. ████████ and SCP-909-02 were removed from the room amid confusion from all personnel involved in the incident. SCP-909-02 later explained the situation to uninvolved personnel and was placed in his holding cell. Dr. ████████ was discharged from duty and given a Class-B amnesiac.

[[/div]]

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-909-03 is to be contained in a customized humanoid containment cell lined with one (1) meter thick carbon steel. SCP-909-03 is to be provided with standard humanoid furnishings, prerecorded entertainment materials provided on request. Access to the cell may be conducted through a reinforced carbon steel door. 

Once every two (2) hours SCP-909-03 is to be provided with one (1) nutritional supplement as outlined in Document 909-03-2. SCP-909-03 is fitted with an central venous catheter to facilitate nutrition. The subject is to be be provided with intravenous nutritional supplements while sleeping. Catheter is to be changed once every three (3) months.

**Description:** SCP-909-03 appears to be a middle-aged African-American male with an extremely fast metabolism. SCP-909-03 requires the recommended amount of caloric intake every 2 hours, and has an internal temperature of [REDACTED].

SCP-909-03 will enter into a trance state if not fed the specified amount of calories in a two-hour period. SCP-909-03 is aware of his actions while in this state and expresses extreme discomfort following the ingestion of denser materials. If SCP-909-03 is asleep he will wake up into this state. When in this state, SCP-909-03 will break down and ingest any matter within sight. This ingestion can include normally indigestible matter such as wood, plastics, metals, and does not distinguish between living subjects and other material.

SCP-909-03 can rend objects with an estimated force of 3000 N and can bite objects with an estimated force of 5000 N while eating. SCP-909-03 is unable to display this strength outside of his trance state.

Examination of SCP-909-03's liver tissue shows that it will produce new enzymes in response to foreign material. These enzymes will metabolize the substrate at ~98% efficiency, effectively detoxifying any drugs or toxins. This includes amnesiacs and anesthetics.

**Addendum 909-03-1:** The words "Mr. Hungry, from Little Misters ® by Dr. ███████" are tattooed upon SCP-909-03's right calf. Upon discovery SCP-909-03 had been wearing a shirt and dress pants, both with the brand name "Doctor's Orders" sewn into their tags.

[[/div]]

**Object Class:** Safe

**Containment Procedures:** SCP-909-04 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell. Music and literature may be made available on request. 

One aide is to be assigned to SCP-909-04 at all times. Aides are to be rotated on 6-hour shifts. SCP-909-04 may request to be left in solitude at any time. However, this privilege is restricted to four (4) hours a day. 

A basic Braille-based communication book has been supplied to SCP-909-04. Simple communication may be performed through this medium, as well as agreed-upon hand signals. Personnel are instructed to not awaken SCP-909-04 while it is suffering from the lunar phase unless absolutely required, as this may cause panic in the subject. Personnel are to wait until SCP-909-04 gives the agreed-upon signal before interaction.

SCP-909-04 suffers from moderate arthritis, and is to be supplied with medication when feeding is possible.

**Description:** SCP-909-04 appears to be an elderly Caucasian male. Subject’s facial features appear to degenerate and regenerate in relation to the lunar cycle, completely disappearing during the new moon and normal during the full moon. Subject’s ears, eyes, nose and mouth will disappear, but facial wrinkles remain. This degeneration and regeneration mimics the phases of the moon, beginning at the left ear and crossing the subject's face.

Subject has explained that the experience is painless, but leaves him blind, deaf and mute when the related features are absent.

SCP-909-04 does not seem to need to eat, drink or breathe when features are absent. However, it has explained that it feels extremely tired while suffering from the lunar phase.

**Addendum 909-04-1:** The words "Mr. Moon, from Little Misters ® by Dr. ███████" are tattooed upon SCP-909-04's right calf. Upon discovery SCP-909-03 had been wearing a coat, dress shirt and slacks, all with the brand name "Doctor's Orders" sewn into their tags. A list similar to the one held by SCP-909-02 has also been found in the left pants pocket.
