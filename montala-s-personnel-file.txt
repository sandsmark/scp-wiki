**History:** Dr. Talan was recruited by the Foundation following his graduation from ███████ █████ ███████████ in 19██.

//Note: Talan, while generally a good worker, does have a tendency to put things off until the last possible minute. Attempts to bring this to his attention typically result in the phrase, “I’ll fix it later.” Attempts are ongoing to solve the issue. – Dr. ███████ Psychology Dept.//

[[tab Out of Character]]

Well, if you’re here reading this, you actually want to find out a bit more about //me//, as opposed to him. 

At the time of writing, I’m a 19 year old college student studying to be a Music Teacher. I’m generally very affable, very easy to get along with, always willing to crack a (sometimes bad) joke, and overall friendly, at least until you give me a good reason not to be. Even then, I’m very much the forgive-and-forget type of person, so I’ll likely forget about it eventually. Unless it was something serious, in which case it may take a long time. 

I’m very willing to help out anyone who needs help, so feel free to send me a PM if you need a draft looked over or something…with scips, I’m decent with tone and grammar/spelling/sentence flow stuff, though you’d be better served to go to someone else for ideas…I can get my own, but I have some slight difficulty helping others flesh out their ideas a majority of the time, which is why I don’t lurk on the Ideas and Brainstorming forum. 

With tales, which is so far what I write, I’m good with grammar, spelling, sentence flow, decent with character development, dialogue, dialogue flow, etc. I’ll be one of the first to tell you when your dialogue is stilted and unnatural. Like I said, if you have something you’d like looked over, feel free to PM me. 

I’m in site19 irregularly, but for long periods of time when I am. It’s all hit and miss with me for chat, at least for a while.
