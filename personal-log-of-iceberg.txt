Morning
I finally got a promotion. At least, I think it's a promotion. Only a lab assistant, but I'll have access to more SCPs than before (Though, I've heard the rumors about some of the Ketar class SCPs). And I've heard Dr. Gears is rather respected in this field. Well, I guess I'll just have to see how today turns out. I've heard dying on the first day on these sort of things rarely happens. 


Evening
I spent most of the day compiling information. Everything we have has to be put into a digital format and sent down to Central Records. Dr. Gear's himself was ok, though seemed to always keep things very professional. I wonder if he's always like that. Today was mostly compiling notes and reports by Dr. Gears. I found a lot of what was documented interesting, but the actually work of putting it on the computer was incredibly dull. And it turns out it's most of my work for the next few days. Oh joy. And I don't think I got a pay raise. I'm starting to wonder just what the Foundation means when they say "promotion."

Morning
Morning was rather uneventful. Breakfast was about the same as always. More work with compiling papers today.Dr. Gears seems to be taking my nickname rather well. Most high ups just call me Dr. ████.

Evening
Like I thought, more paper work. Seems I'll be heading to a containment site, recording data on [[[SCP-882]]]. One of what we'll be looking at is how long it takes people around it to start hearing things. Grinding and clicking. So basically we'll see how long until it makes people go crazy. Well, //thats plesant.// But guess it's what needs done. 

[[[SCP-076]]] caused another incident. Great. Working with us or not, its never been too nice having an immortal super powered psychopath on base. At supper Carl, or [[[SCP-530]]], tried to get some of my food. Had to push him away. Don't want to get reprimanded, not to mention I've heard how bad it smell.
