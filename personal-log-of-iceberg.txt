title:Personal Log of █████ "Iceberg" ████
█████ ██ ████
I finally got a promotion. At least, I think it's a promotion. Only a lab assistant, but I'll have access to more SCPs than before (Though, I've heard the rumors about some of the Ketar class SCPs). And I've heard Dr. Gears is rather respected in this field. 

I spent most of the day compiling information. Today it was mostly notes and reports by Dr. Gears. I lot of interesting, but the actually work was incredibly dull. And it turns out it's most of my work for the next few days. Oh joy.
