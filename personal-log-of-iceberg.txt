Morning
I finally got a promotion. At least, I think it's a promotion. Only a lab assistant, but I'll have access to more SCPs than before (Though, I've heard the rumors about some of the Ketar class SCPs). And I've heard Dr. Gears is rather respected in this field. Well, I guess I'll just have to see how today turns out.


Evening
I spent most of the day compiling information. Today it was mostly notes and reports by Dr. Gears. I found a lot of  what was documented interesting, but the actually work was incredibly dull. And it turns out it's most of my work for the next few days. Oh joy. And I don't think I got a pay raise. I'm starting to wonder just what the Foundation means when they say "promotion."
