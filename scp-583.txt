**Addendum 583-T:** Testimony of [DATA EXPUNGED], after exposure to SCP-583's recording. 

Subject given a exemplary of  "A Clash of Kings", [DATA EXPUNGED] recorded his reading, starting at page 201, stopped on the same page.

> One, two. This is [DATA EXPUNGED], testifying the effect of SCP-583. I start reading.Aggo was back next. The southwest was barren and burnt, he swore. He had found the ruins of two more cities, and since, he has started coughing. Ok, I think it has started. I'll read further, he'll die, you'll see. Back to the text. One was warded by a ring of skulls mounted on rusted iron spears, so he dared not enter, but he had expored the second for as long as he could, before his throat began to ache. He showed Dany an iron bracelet he had found, set with a uncut fire opal the size of her thumb. She was sick too, and the idea of the princess being ill like he was comforted him a little. There were scrolls as well, but they were dry and crumbling and Aggo had left them where they lay. He took a rest in his tent, praying a good night to his Targaryan mistress, and died that same night. I skip a few pages now 'til Dany dies too. Hear this: Here I stand. Look, if that your pleasure, but first tell me your names. And then she fell. I need book with a lot of character in it, I guess.
 

End of the testimony.
