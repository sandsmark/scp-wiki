**Item #:** SCP-5460

**Object Class:** Neutralized

**Special Containment Procedures:** All recovered documentation and schematics pertaining to SCP-5460 are to be kept in a high-security document storage container within the storage wing of [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-64|Site-64]]].

**Description:** SCP-5460 was a prototype telepathy facilitation device created by Anderson Robotics between 2019 and the device's eventual destruction during the joint UIU/Foundation raid on [[[the Blackbird and the Falcon|May 24th, 2024]]]. Recovered notes indicate the primary function of the device was to improve synergy and communication among linked individuals to facilitate more efficient teamwork.

Documentation and schematics recovered from Anderson Robotics World Headquarters indicate that SCP-5460 consisted of a primary console and a series of up to ten headsets. Upon activation of the device, individuals wearing the headsets would be able to telepathically communicate with one another over a range of 5 km. Records indicate that this link could be terminated remotely at any time via SCP-5460's console. The extent of the information capable of being transmitted via SCP-5460's telepathic link is currently unknown, though documentation has confirmed visual and auditory stimuli could be sent with variable degrees of accuracy.

Recovered emails, audio files, and video from the Anderson Robotics Research and Development team suggest that the technology used in SCP-5460 was reverse-engineered from a previously existing [[[The Analog Kid|Maxwellist platform]]] utilized within the Three Portlands Maxwellist community.[[footnote]]Current Foundation contacts within the Maxwellist community have adamantly denied the existence of this technology on questioning, and examination of detained Maxwellists has likewise proven fruitless.[[/footnote]] An investigation into this technology, and potential acquisition for Foundation study by MTF Tau-51 ("Urban Brawl") and MTF Mu-4 ("Debuggers"), is currently ongoing.

Proposals for attempts to rebuild SCP-5460 based upon recovered schematics and documentation are currently pending Ethics Committee review.

**Addendum 5460-A: Recovered Documents 5460-03 and -011**

The following logs were recovered from the workstation of Elanor MacKenzie, a member of the Anderson Robotics Research and Development Team, and the primary developer of SCP-5460 from the project's inception in 2019.

I know that we have hit a lot more roadblocks than we anticipated, and I appreciate your patience as we work through them. I especially want to thank many of you for volunteering during the various tests. Please note that I will never force any of you to serve in a testing capacity against your wishes.

> Hello everyone,
> 
> I know a lot of our colleagues have stepped out of the team in pursuit of different projects at AR. I can't say that I blame them. No one could have foreseen quite as many difficulties getting Quelea up and running as we have run into. That said, I appreciate all of you who have chosen to stick to it. Quelea will change the world not only in how teams synergize in the workplace, but how we as a species communicate. I think that's something worth striving for, and I am glad so many of you do too.
> 
> Vincent has promised to lend us some of the ICSUT and Deer interns to fill in the gaps as we push forward. In the meantime, I will personally be serving as the primary test subject moving forward.

> Hello everyone,
> 
> I know there have been some rumors circulating the office that Vincent is going to pull the plug on Quelea. Let me take this opportunity to put that matter to bed.
> 
> While that was true initially, I have managed to change his mind. The caveat, however, is that he will be requiring weekly updates from here on out, as well as monthly progress demonstrations. We'll be doing these with Peregrine and Saker Units, so I will continue to be the only human test subject, as always.
> 
> I'm not going to sugar coat things. From here on out there will be a lot of midnight oil burnt, and a lot of crunch time. 80 hour weeks will be likely. I'll be putting in that time myself. Please consider this a stepping off point if you would like to pursue other projects as well. 
> 
> I have weathered the storm so far, and so have all of you. I can't begin to repay all of you for your sacrifices so far, but perhaps getting Quelea online will be a good start.

With all current bugs sorted out and successful/safe tests completed during the last four months, Vincent has given us the go-ahead to move into beta testing. We anticipate product release will be sometime in the summer of 2025.
> 
> It's been a long road during the last five years, with a lot of stress and less than satisfactory outcomes for previous versions of the product. I want to thank you personally for sticking with me through it all, as well as for everyone's sacrifices during testing. I know many of us got near the 500-hour mark in terms of contribution. Birthdays and Anniversaries were missed. There was even a divorce or two.

> I could not have asked for a better crew or a better family. Please, please, please tap into all that stocked up vacation time, you have absolutely earned it.

**Addendum 5460-B: Recovered Video File 5460-18**

The following video file was recovered from the closed-circuit security system of Anderson Robotics World Headquarters following the joint UIU/Foundation raid on May 24th, 2024.

> 
> **<15:05:18>** SCP-5460 is visible upon its work station. 
> 
> **<15:05:45>** Security alarms go off on the floor. Numerous Anderson Robotics employees are visible in the background in a state of distress. Supervisors begin the process of personnel evacuation as Peregrine Unit Android security appears on the scene.
> 
> **<15:10:25>** The section of the Anderson Robotics Research and Development Lab visible from the camera is fully abandoned for the next 30 minutes.
> 
> **<15:40:03>** An Anderson Robotics employee later identified as Myra Rider[[footnote]]Member of Anderson Robotics Research and Development Team and known member of the Three Portlands Maxwellist Church. Records indicate Rider was not assigned to work on Anderson Robotics development of SCP-5460.[[/footnote]] approaches the workstation accompanied by four Peregrine Unit Androids. Rider directs the androids to watch the door. 
> 
> **<15:45:24>** An additional Anderson Robotics employee later identified as Elanor MacKenzie approaches Rider. MacKenzie and Rider begin a verbal altercation.
> 
> **<15:58:19>** The Peregrine Units begin to engage approaching MTF Gamma-13 task force members via small arms fire. MacKenzie draws a pistol from her jacket and instructs Rider to disengage from SCP-5460. Rider refuses and commands one of the Peregrine Units to restrain MacKenzie. Mackenzie disables one of the androids with several shots to the head. A second android shoots MacKenzie once before restraining her. Rider begins to work on SCP-5460's console.
> 
> **<16:00:10>** SCP-5460 sparks and catches fire. Rider steps back and watches as the device fully disintegrates over the course of the next 30 seconds. MacKenzie visibly struggles against the Peregrine Unit that has restrained her.
> 
> **<16:01:50>** MTF agents successfully destroy the remaining Peregrine units. Rider rolls what appears to be a grenade at the approaching agents and hides behind SCP-5460's worktable.
> 
> **<16:01:53>** The grenade explodes into a large cloud of unidentified particulates that fully engulf the MTF agents.
> 
> **<16:01:56>** The particulate disperses. The MTF agents are gone. Rider peers from behind the SCP-5460 worktable. 
> 
> **<16:02:00>** Rider flees from the view of the camera, deeper into the facility. MacKenzie is visibly distraught and remains behind. MacKenzie sifts through the remains of SCP-5460 with her hands and appears to attempt to reassemble the device despite visibly significant blood loss.
> 
> **<16:03:30>** MacKenzie stops attempting to reassemble SCP-5460 and stands still with her hands resting within the remains.
> 
> **<16:04:30>** Additional MTF Gamma-13 agents are visible securing the scene and persuing Rider. MacKenzie is apprehended without resistance.

MacKenzie currently remains within Foundation custody and has been cooperative in providing information regarding her former employer and SCP-5460. Attempts to locate Rider by MTF Tau-51 and UIU agents within Three Portlands are ongoing.
