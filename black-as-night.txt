[[size 150%]] The Parauniversal Ramifications of Human Greed [[/size]]

[[size 130%]] **Abstract** [[/size]]
It has been conclusively established the nature of sapience is closely linked to that anomalous [((bibcite blackmoon))] and that on the whole, the emotions of humanity as a whole have ontokinetic properties [((bibcite PDAG))]. Given that collective emotion has corresponding effects on reality, one must hypothesize that want and need -- the strongest of human emotions [((bibcite greed))] must have drastic effects on reality. This further becomes complicated by the personification of such concepts, which will result in unknown effects.

**Project Proposal 1994-043**

**Name:** Fat Piggy

**Abstract:** //Fat Piggy// is a piggy-bank (normal model, as cheap as possible) painted with a monocle, mustache and the MC&D logo. Every hour, the piggy-bank will actualize a small amount of conceptual wealth (that is, money which is not represented in a physical form) into the shape of a small gold coin, which will be produced within the piggy-bank. 

When somewhere between eight-five and ninety coins have been produced, the piggy-bank will crack open and explode, spraying coins everywhere. After that, the piggy-bank will start reforming, to start the cycle again.

**Intent:** To the oil magnate, to the harsh dictator, to the kings and queens and lords and ladies, the common people are specks of dirt. To Marshall, Carter and Dark, the rich are unto ants.

The honorable Messrs. Marshall, Carter and Dark are so rich that if they were to lose all but 10% of their wealth, they would still be among the richest men in the world. The amount of money //Fat Piggy// skims off the top of their ledgers is almost nothing at all. They will not even notice that it is gone. But it is more than enough to support a modest life for a half a dozen men and women.

Eat the rich. Part of a complete breakfast.

[[size 0.75em]]^^**3**^^[[/size]] The man, who had once been humble and observant of God, was held by terrible greed. [[size 0.75em]]^^**4**^^[[/size]] Jesus led his disciples to the house of that man, and called upon him to meet them outside.

[[size 0.75em]]^^**6**^^[[/size]] Jesus saw at once the spirit had made him greedy and desiring for gold, and went up to speak with him.

[[size 0.75em]]^^**7**^^[[/size]] Jesus said to the man, "Your greed has blinded you to the truth of God." To which the man said, [[size 0.75em]]^^**8**^^[[/size]] "Be quiet. I have no need for your truth. I am great on my own." Jesus raised his hands and blessed the man. [[size 0.75em]]^^**9**^^[[/size]] So the unclean spirit left the man, and left this world. Jesus turned and spoke to his disciples, [[size 0.75em]]^^**10**^^[[/size]] "Know that it is easier for the rich man to pass through the eye of a needle than through the Gates of Heaven and the Kingdom of God. [[size 0.75em]]^^**11**^^ [[/size]] For ordinary men, this is impossible, but through God all things are possible."

__Summary:__ Small collection of entities, originating from outside of material realm. Unclear connection to certain human concepts, such as greed/wealth/desire/money/ambition. All have vested interest in gaining prior concepts and maintaining status, appears to be primary goal. Relation to one another unknown.
@@ @@
Four currently identified, fifth suspected. Three of four confirmed leaders/influential within large anomalous business entities. Fourth rarely seen. Potential fifth does not appear to share the same goals of the others, but has limited contact. Outlier, may warrant further investigation. Does not currently appear threatening.
@@ @@
Goals of each vary, but are generally consistent. One sells objects of luxury to rich, second sells objects of need to the desperate. Objectives of third unclear (contaminated by malignant fundamental constant associated with industry/production/rust/mechanization). Observation of fourth has not proved fruitful in establishing motives. Fifth only suspected.

__List of confirmed members:__
 - Mister Dark of Marshall and Carter
 - The Investor of the Factory

[[collapsible show="What is this?" hide="A GoI-Format Series"]]
[[<]]
This is a series about the life and times of Mr. Night, an entity of unknown and ancient power closely associated with greed. The series details his interactions with different groups over the years, from each of their different perspectives. 

Night was originally the head honcho of the Chicago Spirit, but he saw that the scene where the Spirit had been operating was going to become a lot less open in the future, and left before things went south for the group. He spends the next couple of years wrapping up some loose ends, before going back to where he came from.

This is also an attempt at making a GoI-Format series, as opposed to a Tale Series or SCP series. This isn't really something that has been done before on the site, as far as I can tell. The original intent was that every instalment would be a GoI-Format, but then I had a good idea for a tale to submit to the Halloween contest, and made that the opening.

The works here present an new take on the Groups and characters involved. There is influence from outside works, which are normally linked, but there are some differences. Most notably, the depiction of the Chicago Spectre is decidedly not that of the Third Law canon, and is a new take on the group.

**Nota bene:** Black as Night is explictly not in any canon on the site, or involved with any. It may reference other canons and draw on them, but it is entirely standalone from other canons.
