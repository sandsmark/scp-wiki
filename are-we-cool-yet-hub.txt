Are We Cool Yet? is an artistic movement existing on the fringes of the international avant-garde, with roots in the early surrealist art movements of the late 19th and early 20th century and the growing scientific understanding and study of the anomalous that began to develop during that time. (For one man's account of how the movement came into its own, refer to the contest entry tale "[[[Birth of the Cool]]]".) The movement has no centralized leadership, no headquarters, very few traditions or conventions, and no official membership rolls or requirements - the only thing one need do to call oneself a member is to make art that employs, exploits, or revolves around anomalous objects, beings, or phenomena.

The organization of an AWCY? cell varies wildly from place to place. Many groups are organized into small salons led by a creative mastermind or a professional critic, while others are collectives with no clear leader, and some members prefer to work entirely on their own. In the opinions of some, it is not even necessary to know that the movement exists in order to be a part of it. The tendency of some such groups to produce highly visible public artworks that cause death, injury, or lasting psychological harm has led some to decry the entire movement as a bunch of "art terrorists", a label some of its members wear with pride, some repudiate entirely, and some wear ironically.

The largest and most visible gathering of AWCY? artists in any place or time is "//Sommes-Nous Devenus Magnifiques?//", a grand exhibition held every ten years since 1874, at which those "in the know" can gather to view and scrutinize a selection of some of the finest works in anomalous art produced over the previous decade. To have a work accepted is considered (by those who care about such things) to be one of the greatest achievements an anartist can attain in a career, and members of cells all around the world petition to have their works displayed.

[[tab Information]]
AWCY objects are described in a format called a Project Proposal. The Project Proposal is a brief essay by an individual artist about an object s/he has either created or intends to create, and is submitting for consideration in the decennial exhibition or which they are seeking funding or materials from a patron so that they can create it. The page title of a proposal should be "Project Proposal XXXX-YYY: Title", in which "XXXX" is the year of the next exhibition for which it will be eligible for entry (so if the artist is writing in the late '70s, it would be in preparation for the 1984 Expo), "YYY" being an arbitrary number assumed to be derived from the order in which that proposal was received by the exposition's submission jury, and "Title" being the artist's name for the object.

The essay is formatted as follows:

**Title:** //The artist's title for the piece as mentioned above, italicized.//
**Material Requirements:** A bulleted list of materials the artist used to create the piece or which s/he expects to need, ranging from the ordinary to the exotic and hard to find to that which is anomalous in and of itself.
**Abstract:** A brief description of the piece - what it is, what it's supposed to do, how it does it (if the artist knows), how it should be displayed, etc.
**Intent:** In this section, the artist, speaking in first person, describes their reasons for creating this piece; what motivated them to come up with the idea, what they hope to achieve by producing it, how they went about making it, who the intended audience is, what kind of reaction they hope to get from the audience, and so on.
