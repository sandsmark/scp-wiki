[[size 300%]]**SCP-5000 Contest: Mystery!**[[/size]]

++ At its core, the SCP Wiki has been an attempt to expand upon, and perhaps solve, the mysteries and riddles posed by SCP-173 on /x/ more than a decade ago. What is the Foundation? What are SCP objects, and where do they come from? What in the world is an 'HMCL supervisor'? As the fiction has expanded, the mysteries have only gotten more and more complex. Now, for SCP-5000, you shall be posing more. Perhaps you'll solve them as well. That's up to you.

+ Dates (subject to change, watch this space)

++ Posting is now open!

**Posting Closes:** January 21st, 2020, 12:00 AM Eastern Time
**Results Decided:** February 8th, 2020, 12:00 AM Eastern Time

+ To Enter:

Post your entry to the site with the url '5000contest<yourusername>' with your site user name in place of <yourusername.> For example, if a user named TroyL were to post an entry it would have the url 5000contesttroyl. This page must be posted by you (or, if it is a collaboration, one of the partners). Add the tag "5000" to your entry so it shows up on this page.

Additionally, authors are required to post their top five slot selections (excluding 5000) in the comments of their piece. **Failure to do so may result in you losing your place in the queue**.

+ Rules

* Be good to each other, seriously.
* Placing is based on net vote total, in descending order.
* Any contestant who takes unusual and/or negative actions to increase their vote total, or decrease that of their competitors, will be disqualified for the involved contest and potentially banned from further contests (and possibly further disciplinary action).
 * Examples of shenanigans include, but are in no way limited to:
  * Downvoting all of your competitors' work within minutes of them being posted
  * Spamming people with PMs about your work
  * Spurring Malicious Upvoting/Downvoting, whether on your work or anyone else's
 * If you're not sure if something counts as shenanigans, then it probably does, but feel free to ask a Community Outreach Member.
* One entry per user
* Collaborations are allowed, but that will count as the one entry for all participants
* Pre-existing drafts are allowed, so long as they have never been posted to the wiki
* 'Mystery' shall be interpreted very broadly. So long as you can explain how your work relates to mystery as a concept, in any interpretation, it'll likely be accepted. The theme is here to inspire, not constrain. If you're not sure if it'll count, feel free to ask one of the contest marshals listed below.
* Edits to works **are** allowed.
* Contest entries will undergo normal deletion processes.
* The prize, obviously, is the SCP-5000 slot. Runners up get to choose other Series VI slots in order of place.
* All Contest Marshals have the ability to disqualify entries for violations of the above-listed rules, egregiously poor sportsmanship not otherwise enumerated, or failure to fit the theme. All decisions are appealable to [[*user ProcyonLotor]].
