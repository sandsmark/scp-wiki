title:173
He stands
king
over all he has ever wanted; a shadowed corner
in a fetid cell.
Life
is //nothing// to stone.
Mountains erode.
Hillsides crumble.
//To him, they go as whisper fast as **men**// 
whose eyes 
have
failed
them.
Offal spreads from his feet,
stinking, harsh, 
making unprepared eyes water-
so much faster, 
stone.
Stone does not care for life, 
and this stone cares yet less
but for the quick, 
subtle
delicate
erosion
of the //snap// of bone on bone.
"Abandon all hope ye who enter here."
Stone does not care.
Don't blink.
