**Item #:** SCP-1134

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1134 is contained in Volatile Items Storage Warehouse 14 in a 3m x 3m x 4m room with one exit consisting of a standard reinforced door. All interior surfaces of the containment room are to be coated in SCP-1134-1.

Personnel requesting the use of SCP-1134-1 in containment procedures or security measures must be Level 2 or above and must obtain clearance from Dr. Blank.

**Description:** SCP-1134 is a circular polyvinyl-chloride 10-gallon container of paint-and-primer mix bearing the label "████████ Conglomerate NO MESS Ballistics-Grade Paint | Colour formula 366" in a translation below the primary label, which is slightly modified traditional kanji. All other writing on the drum is in this modified traditional kanji, and deals with patent information and date of manufacture, noted as 04/11/20██. The lid is easily detached and reattached. 

SCP-1134-1 is the liquid contained in SCP-1134. It has roughly the same consistency as a high-quality paint-and-primer mix. There are currently 8.02 gallons remaining of the original ten, the remaining liquid having been used as paint prior to recovery or in subsequent Foundation testing. SCP-1134-1 appears to be a glossy violet in color, measuring at a visible wavelength of 416 nm.

SCP-1134-1 is remarkably efficient when used as a paint. It spreads uniformly and only adheres to surfaces not currently coated in itself. It comes cleanly off of the brush onto the surface, allowing all of the liquid to be utilized with utmost effectiveness.

Once dry, SCP-1134-1 has been observed to be completely bulletproof, withstanding impacts up to a .30 caliber sniper round. Any surface painted with SCP-1134-1 will be undamaged by fire on the side that is painted. Firing rounds from the other side of the surface have shown the ammunition to penetrate the wall up to the point at which the liquid forms a dry barrier.

Despite the usefulness inherent in this property, working with SCP-1134-1 is extremely hazardous, due to the secondary anomalous qualities of the liquid. Any "spills" or "drips" of SCP-1134-1, either from SCP-1134 or from a paint brush, quickly accelerate to a speed and force equivalent to a .347 magnum handgun round. The paint drops break up into smaller uniform droplets upon impact with an unpainted surface, and behave with trajectories identical to the ricochet characteristics of .347 magnum handgun rounds. 

Unlike bullets, SCP-1134-1 does not lose energy when coming into contact with a surface and will instead ricochet at a constant speed until making contact with a SCP-1134-1 painted surface or organic obstruction. Once contact is made with the painted surface, the ricocheting SCP-1134-1 is absorbed into the liquid on the surface and a corresponding increase in surface coverage can be measured.

**Recovery Log 1134 Abstract:** Recovered following interception of a 911 call, in which the caller claimed that he had just "shot Juan and Nick with my fucking paintbrush!" An ambulance from the Special Care Providers front company was dispatched to the scene, ██07 ██th Street, ███████, Illinois. Foundation agents determined that the caller, Henry ██████, had been painting the wall of a new home when his coworkers, Nicholas ██████ and Juan ██████ had engaged in friendly ribbing of Henry over his sexual preferences. Henry responded by flicking SCP-1134-1 at them with a paint brush, resulting in [DATA EXPUNGED] 

A Class A amnesiac was administered to Henry and the remains of the two victims covered by an electrical fault causing a structure fire. The portion of the wall painted with SCP-1134-1 remained intact after the fire.
