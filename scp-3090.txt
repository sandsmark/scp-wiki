**Item #:** SCP-3090

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3090 is to be mocked relentlessly on various websites and imageboards in order to //definitely not give it more views and those more upvotes//. Such mocking is to be accompanied by linking to the article in question, reminiscing on days gone by when authors didn't have to stoop to such lengths.

**Description:** SCP-3090 is the absolute proof that the SCP Wiki has gone to total shit. Bolstered by the leftist cancer [[[gamers-against-weed-hub|Gamers Against Weed]]], SCP-3090 shows for sure that the site can no longer go back to its glory days of short horror works about Dr. Clef being an awful asshole and Dr. Bright being a creepy fucker, or whatever people upvoted in those days.

The more one talks about SCP-3090 and how much it has ruined the site or is SJW filth (because SCP-3090 is a gay girl, which is a dogwhistle for SJWs), the more into obscurity it shall recede. The goal of this is for 3090 to be talked about so much that it fails to enter into anyone's minds, since it is perfectly rational to talk about the things you hate relentlessly.

**Discovery:** SCP-3090 was discovered by some tumblr users who are true fans of the SCP Foundation, before it became trash. Upon discovering that someone wrote about a teenage girl who liked video games and had a TV for a head, they proceeded to tear the article apart, blasting it for its unoriginality and Mary Sue-qualities, as if anyone would want to be an introverted, depressed teenager locked up against their will by an organization dedicated to containing anomalies for an indefinite amount of time. The brave users who spread the link around on tumblr to shit on it ended up reaching almost 50 notes, in that time exposing it to tens, if not hundreds or thousands of users, some of whom have definitely not upvoted the article at all.
