++++ **__Special Containment Procedures__**
The Parazoology Division will regulate and maintain 2 SCP-5508 colonies within Site-51's Eco Containment Chamber 3. All maintenance will be preformed by automated systems and unmanned drones. 

Parazoology task force Delta-44 ("Critter Crushers") is to monitor ant populations within the state of Arkansas for any uncontained SCP-5508 populations and destroy them. If any civilian contact has been made, records of the encounter are to be confiscated and amnestics administered to witnesses. 

Personnel without training in mental psionic defense are not to come into contact with uncontained SCP-5508 or SCP-5508-1 under any circumstances. In this situation, the unaffected individuals are authorized to employ long-range incendiary protocols on SCP-5508. Any SCP-5508-1 that survive are to be terminated on sight.

SCP-5508 is a mutation in southern meat ant (//Iridomyrmex purpureus//) populations in which a colony will be capable of external psionic and physical manipulation. The colonies will use this manipulation for hunting organisms that they would otherwise be unable. An organism that comes within 3 meters of SCP-5508 will experience a drastic change in behavior and are designated as SCP-5508-1 instances.

SCP-5508-1 instances will demonstrate a complete lack of self-preservation displaying a desire to be eaten by nearby organisms. In humans, this effect will cause SCP-5508-1 instances to vocalize their desire to be eaten. Prolonged exposure to this effect will lead to SCP-5508-1 instances partaking in self-consumption. SCP-5508-1 instances show the ability to survive severe blood loss and bodily damage without expiring, typically living for days in terminal conditions. 

Whether SCP-5508 is a natural occurrence or the by-product of outside manipulation is unknown. The location of known populations is well outside the natural habitat of southern meat ants, indicating a high probability of some level of human involvement.

On 2019/07/20, a live video stream was uploaded to the video-sharing platform YouTube depicting SCP-5508-1 affected individuals. The video was flagged internally and assets within Google contacted the Foundation; they provided the recording and GPS data associated with the upload. The individuals depicted in the video were confirmed to be Connor and Daniel Philips of Newton, Arkansas.

//[Camera pans to Connor Philips' face.]//

**Connor:** Guys, you're not gonna' believe this.

//[Camera angle changes showing a large field.]//

**Connor:** Danny never came in for lunch, so I came lookin' for em. I didn't get too close now, but I'm damn sure he was sittin' out here, pokin' his pecker. I kid you not. //[Laughter.]//

**Connor:** We're gonna' pay him a lil' visit.

//[Connor begins walking through the field, Daniel Philips comes into view from behind. Daniel is sitting on the ground looking between his legs, both arms are moving rapidly. As Connor gets closer a large anthill comes into view.]//

**Conner:** //[Whispering:]// Is he beatin' it on the ants?

//[Connor is now approximately 5 meters from Daniel and the anthill, he begins circling around to the front of Daniel.]//

**Connor:** Hey Danny! Wha- wait wh- What are you doing, Danny! 

//[Daniel's lower body is covered in ants. It has sustained severe damage, almost no tissue remaining on his calves and feet. Daniel is in the process of consuming his own intestines when Connor interrupts.]//

**Daniel:** B- Bro, you gotta try this, it's fuckin' delicious.

//[Daniel reaches out with his intestine pulling out more from the tear in his abdomen.]//

**Connor:** Jesus Christ Danny,  snap out of it! I- I gotta' go get help.

**Daniel:** No! You gotta' have some. I'm tellin' you- //[Daniel takes a bite of his intestine.]// it's great!

//[Daniel tugs on his intestine tearing his abdomen and fully disemboweling himself.]//

**Daniel:** //[Gurgles blood before vomiting.]// Sit with me, brother. There's plenty for us both.

**Connor:** Fuck, fuck, fuck!

//[Connor begins running towards Daniel, stopping 2 meters from him. Connor then appears to sit next to Daniel before dropping the camera on the ground. The image goes black.]//

//Daniel and Connor can be heard grunting over the sounds of wet popping, gurgling, and chewing. This continues for 3 hours before the video was flagged and removed.//

Responding agents recovered two SCP-5508 colonies on the Philips residence, along with the skeletal remain of Daniel, Connor, and two squirrels near one of the SCP-5508 colonies. The concealment team responsible for SCP-5508 enacted Cover Story P977 (Accidental Death) in regards to Daniel and Connor Philips. 

Personal records indicated the Philips brothers purchased both SCP-5508 colonies as a means of pest control for their 15 acre wheat farm. The invoice relating to the purchase of SCP-5508 was labeled "Pest Control, Pests Controlling Pests" and signed by a C. Larson. Handprint analysis confirms the signatory to be [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4542 Craig Larson], a person of interest with known connections to para-entomology. 

Mr. Larson's connection lends to the probability of a para-entomological organization operating without the Foundation's direct knowledge. The investigation is currently ongoing.
