 **Item #**: SCP-1137

**Object Class**: Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures**: SCP-1137 is held in a locked box in item storage locker 8A at Site-19. Level 3 clearance is required for access to SCP-1137. It requires no extraordinary physical measures to contain it, however, due to its memetic qualities knowledge of SCP-1137's true nature is to be tightly controlled among personnel. See Document 1137-17 for a detailed description of anti-memetic safety standards. 

**Description**: SCP-1137 is a blue glass sphere approximately 10cm in diameter. To ordinary observers, it does not appear to have any special qualities, nor does it pose any risk. It is possible take measurements of its material composition, weight, opacity, hardness, and any other physical properties of the sphere. However, its anomalous properties take effect if any attempt is made to measure the sphere's curvature or smoothness, or any other properties related to its spherical nature.

If anyone does try to measure SCP-1137's spherical properties, they will become convinced that it is in fact a mathematically perfect sphere. They will believe that measurements consistently return results confirming this, regardless of the accuracy of the measuring device being used. Due to the memetic nature of SCP-1137, it is unknown whether SCP-1137 actually possesses these dimensions, or whether the observer is merely interpreting the measurements as such. Small samples taken from SCP-1137 also display its memetic properties, and do not seem to affect the perception of the shape of SCP-1137.

It is not actually necessary to perform the measurements oneself for a subject to fall under SCP-1137's memetic influence, merely being told that its shape is physically impossible is enough for the memetic agent to take root. However transmission in this fashion requires the listener to understand the reasons why a perfect mathematical sphere cannot exist in material form, thus it is unlikely to spread to those without a scientific background. It is also possible to circumvent the memetic agent by specifying that it only appears to be a perfect sphere when measuring, without actually stating outright that it is such.

Once infected, a subject will become obsessed with the fact that, despite the fact that all measurements indicate that SCP-1137 is a perfect sphere, it is completely impossible for it to be one. This will become deeply ingrained in the subject's mind. The subject will attempt to disprove this inconsistency, resorting to more and more accurate tools. Researchers have been recorded utilizing equipment including the on-site electron microscope in these endeavours. Despite this, they will never be able to perceive any results other than those indicating SCP-1137 is a mathematically perfect object, even when performing measurements at the picometer level.

After extensive testing during which they are unable to prove their conviction, the subject will eventually accept that SCP-1137's nature must be possible. Upon doing so, the secondary memetic properties of SCP-1137 will take effect. The subject will slowly acquire the compulsion to reproduce an instance of SCP-1137. If the subject has any proficiency with a physical craft, (such as sculpting, glassmaking, metalworking, etc) they will begin by attempting to produce a perfect sphere in that medium. If they do not have any prior experience with crafting, they will gradually attempt to learn one. 

The subject will continue attempting to produce an instance of SCP-1137, but in every instance they will determine that is not precise enough. As this goes on, the subject will become increasingly frustrated and obsessed. They will often try and experiment in other mediums, and after repeated failures the subject will attempt to use increasingly unconventional materials to attain their goal, sometimes resorting to animal or human remains. Eventually the obsession overwhelms the subject's thought processes, with the subject forgoing sleep, food and ordinary bodily functions in order to continue attempting their constructions. Subjects invariably expire either due to starvation or self-mutilation.

Due to the fact that under normal circumstances an object with SCP-1137's spherical qualities is indeed impossible to construct in nature, this was at first assumed to be its only anomalous features. As a result, after being taken into the Foundation's possession, researchers were immediately exposed to its memetic qualities. The fact that the memetic effects of SCP-1137 are at first indistinguishable from ordinary scientific testing means that some time passed before the Foundation realized SCP-1137's true nature. Because of this, an estimated ███ individuals were infected. Strict anti-memetic procedures have been implemented surrounding knowledge of SCP-1137's anomalous properties, and a cover story is given to personnel lacking Level-4 clearance regarding it status and true effects.
