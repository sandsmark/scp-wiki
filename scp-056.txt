**Item #:** SCP-056

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** --SCP-056 is to be kept in a room of its choosing, with whatever furnishings it expresses desire for. Level 1 personnel and above may interact with SCP-056 at any time they choose, for a time length not exceeding two hours. The subject is to be guarded by a minimum of three (3) security staff at all times, with shift changes every four hours. Each guard is to be armed with non-lethal tranquilizer pistols, loaded with no less than fifteen hundred (1500) microliters of cyclopyrrolone tranquilizer.-- Any irregularities in personnel and staff developed by extended exposure to SCP-056 will result in psychological examination and relocation to site ████.

SCP 056 has been upgraded to isolation protocols, pending keter classification. SCP-056 is to be isolated from human contact outside of 'mining procedures.' Following 'the electrical incident' the Foundation is currently experimenting with several species of domestic animals as suitable morphological 'models' for SCP 056's form. The morphological specimens are contained with the SCP, along with ample nutrition and housekeeping for the animals. 

* [Note from Dr. Flint: If necessary, remove any carcasses from the room. When wolves are the superior dogs, apparently, we can't continue to use canines. I'd recommend lizards, but...]

[EXPUNGED] 
In the event of an emergency, or if SCP-056 becomes violent, it is to be subdued and contained within its room if possible. At no time should personnel attempt to harm SCP-056; see //Addendum 2-b//.

**Description:** SCP-056 is a human being of variable size, gender, and appearance, which changes in response to the environment around it, especially in regards to living and sentient beings. Its most common form is of a handsome man in his middle twenties, dressed in a garb of similar appearance to that of the personnel guarding it but of a higher quality and aesthetic value. However, it has been recorded as taking these forms:

* A large, well groomed Labrador Retriever (when exposed to Doctor █████ ████'s dog).
* A woman of similar appearance to famous actress Scarlett Johansson when passing by a group of younger female staff.
* A female doctor in a white lab coat when speaking with various researchers. When asked to take an IQ test, the subject scored nearly thirty (30) points higher than the highest scoring researcher available.
* A male bodybuilder, who was able to lift nearly two-hundred and fifty (250) kilogrammes twice on a bench press machine in the Sector's gym. This was thirty (30) kilogrammes heavier than the strongest security guard's maximum at the time.
* A couch of extremely pleasing aesthetic value (when left alone in the subject's room).


These changes will generally occur the moment all people in the area lose focus on the subject, which occurs immediately upon exposure to a new object or person ''(See Addendum 3)''. Filming these changes has proved inconsequential, as any viewing the tapes or feed suffer the same momentary confusion. Clothing will also change during this time, though 056 has yet to manifest any sort of tools or weapons. 

It is theoretically impossible to view SCP-056's original or "natural" form. When left in an empty, concrete cell and under closed-loop video surveillance, it took on the form of a higher quality camera, and appeared to monitor the camera watching it. Further attempts to yield its natural form discovered that when alone, it had no readable life signs, including body temperature, heart beat, or weight. It is assumed by researchers that it could not exist without any sort of perception.

Personnel in contact with the subject often report feeling "jealous" or "unsatisfied", yet will often give a great deal of both positive and negative attention to SCP-056, which can be predicted by their personality types. Security staff will often claim that they wish to follow the subject's commands, even if they dislike it or its current form, while researchers in extended contact with it will often try to argue and verbally abuse it, which usually results in the subject sending them out in shame. 

SCP-056 is quite capable of speech, and can apparently communicate in any language, verbal or not, and has shown fluency in over 200 dialects, including those invented by cryptographers and hobbyists. It frequently treats the staff around it with disdain, though is generally willing to do whatever is asked of it, so long as the inquiring does so in a submissive way. It expresses interest in magazines, fashion, automobiles, theoretical science, sports, and a multitude of other subjects, usually expressing greater knowledge and understanding of the topic than the person communicating with it. Personnel will generally become angry, disenchanted, or disgusted with SCP-056 after speaking with it for great lengths of time, though they will try to speak with it again if possible. When questioned about other SCPs, it showed fear and occasionally hatred, and refused to speak about any of them, even objects classified as Safe.

Testing Procedures:
[DATA EXPUNGED]

**Addendum 2-b:** Results:
* One (1) male Class D Personnel, armed with knife. Intent: to harm subject. (Subject appeared as a lean, fit man of approximately twenty years of age. Subject proceeded to disarm and kill personnel.)
* One (1) female Class D Personnel, bearing a bottle of fine wine. Intent: to offer subject gift. (Subject appeared as a beautiful woman, accepted the gift, and upon tasting, spit it back in the personnel's face before waving her away.)
* Two (2) Class D Personnel, both male and female, carrying nothing and intending nothing. (Subject appeared as a beautiful woman in a well-tailored business suit. Examined both personnel, then dismissed them.)
* Ten (10) Class D Personnel, all male, intending and carrying nothing. (Subject appeared as a beautiful woman, dressed in a low-cut red dress. After approximately ten minutes, all personnel began showing signs of irritation, and five minutes later broke out in fighting. Subject waved them away after watching them for seven minutes.)
* One (1) female Level 4 Personnel, voted to be best looking woman on facility. Carried nothing, intended nothing. (Subject appeared as an extremely aesthetically pleasing woman, and displayed a large lexicon and understanding of management skills. Spoke to personnel for nearly ninety minutes, until personnel became infuriated and left the room.)

**Addendum 4: Mining Procedures**

* A note from Dr. Flint:
* //Following Dr. K's brilliant breakthroughs with this thing, we've been able to access that phenomenally intelligent ticker working in its human brain. Due to his social-heavy methods, 056 had become somewhat chatty, more open to sharing some of its knowledge. Kennith considered it his greatest achievement when it ceased beggining every sentence with "No, you idiot, this is why you're wrong," and started providing answers to the team's queries. Most of this is salvaged from Kennith's notes, and the method is updated every six weeks, to be signed, dated, and stamped ALWAYS.  
No shoddy lab work people, keep this project methodical.//
* //Theory:// Due to the intelligence expressed by SCP-056, various discussion and debate led this research team, composed of ███████ Kennith, SCP-056 itself, et al, to consider the possibility of utilizing a consistently superior intelligence as a sort of "biological genie," a certain check for theoretical validity. Inhibiting this process was SCP-056's supreme egocentrism, which initially only permitted a true-false response from the entity; "a meager feat for any basic questioner" according to SCP-056. However, with time, the research team discovered techniques for guiding information exchange with 056; this document is a method outlining such discourse. -- ███████ Kennith

//1.0 Appearance and Demeanor//
* Personnel must be freshly washed and groomed (within 30 minutes of interaction with SCP-056), dressed in simple garments (refer to chart in break room), and intending to only extract the information from SCP-056 as politely and submissively as possible, according to the individual's social customs. Prior to entering the containment area for an interview, all excess items and accessories must be stored in the break room lockers.

//1.1 Linguistic Method//
* Personnel must only refer to the SCP as "instructor," "doctor," "scholar," or some other similar honorific. SCP-056 does not respond to any references of "SCP-056" and will ignore personnel who refer to it as such, or employ the terminology in general. The personnel must never refer to themselves in ANY manner. The question(s) must be phrased as succinctly, clearly, and with as tight as parameters as possible. 056 interprets any vagueness in speech as inferior and often ignores personnel who provide such.
* //Note from Dr. Flint: "Despite Kennith's suggestion to 'Spend more time with it people!' and 'it's just a matter of playing its game.' SCP-056 is not to be engaged alone or unsupervised.//

//1.2 Interview Method//
* Personnel must keep gaze lowered at all times. All questions proposed by personnel must be as succinctly stated as possible--056 can comprehend speed-readers with ease. Personnel may wait up to 300s [5 minutes] before assuming a question is ignored.
* All responses from SCP-056 must be recorded. 
* An MP3 recording device/timer is included with interview materials.
* Should SCP-056 respond in a manner perceived as insulting, demeaning, or otherwise provoking an aggravated response from the personnel, the interview is immediately terminated and the staff retire. Should personnel begin to experience sensations of anxiety, annoyance, or anger, the other staff are immediately notified and the interview paused. Should distresses persist, the interview must be terminated and staff retire.

//[Note from Dr. Flint: 6.18% 'success' rate for non-true/false responses, 46% null response, before the electrical incident. Three sessions a day. Little wonder in retrospect.//

Female Interviewer: Please, remember this is a formal interview. Communicate as if Flint and an  L4 were in the room.

██████ W (L0|Terminated): The computer was essentially wiped, so we installed it in the  
"quiet room" the technicians set up. Supposed to be completely insular, from a signal point of view. Cassette tapes and dark room film to record the sessions. 

I: Was the room verified to be sealed?

W: [REDACTED] We checked both ways. So we're sitting in this weird little room with these dim blue battery LEDs, and the math people load their program on an FD Diskette. They push start on the program. We sit there for forty minutes, and [REDACTED]

I: Yes, Mr. ████████. What was the first indication of anomalous activity?

W: Well, there wasn't--wasn't any anomalous activity, from where we were. 

I: You didn't think it strange, that with--five people in the room, the SCP chose to emulate  1992 computer hardware? As a technician on this project, are you aware of this particular Euclid's behavior?

W: We... we figured it was taking its time. You know. Kennith, the expert, he was there beaming the whole time [REDACTED], telling us to just wait, that it was trying to make us annoyed--. Anyway, we're sitting there, then the calculation finishes and the computer spits out a 1. 

[EXPUNGED] 

W: --we proceeded, somewhat alarmed, out of the room. 

I: What did the team discover? Did you terminate the hardware and contain the SCP?

W: We... I can't remember, it's odd... the building seemed empty, really quiet, suddenly this guy in a lab coat run by and shouts out 'hey, this way.' [REDACTED] We follow him, and the power cuts out. No lights.

I: Were you able to maintain contact with this person, or identify him?

W: No, we lost him in the dark. He might've been new, I'd never seen him before. Might've been foreign. Good looking.

I: Please continue.

W: Right, so the power's out, and it's not like Sector ██ has SCP for darkness, so we don't have immediate backup. As I'm rusting around in these desks with, using my cigarette torch for a flashlight, the monitors of every computer flicker on, and this beautiful image... [REDACTED] --she's on screen and I can't stare at anything else. After that a while, I don't know, minutes maybe, I hear this thump nearby and look and Kennith is strangling one of the math people, this old woman who didn't speak a lot of English, and he looked so blissful and content. I couldn't move, all I was thinking about was the ██████ on the screen... 

I: When did you realize that the MTF team had secured the Sector?

W: I... I can't remember... now that you reminded me...

I: Thank you, Mr. ████████.
