So what is going on with the something where we have to get into the head of someone else and then we'll be getting our rocks on and off without thinking it through?

Bringing heads into the Collective is a good deed where you go to the next shift. When we meet a new fresh headspace then we can't be using it for our own fulfillment.

That is not a collective way.

An Oneiroi known only as JUDY for this flittering parchment in a sea of confusion slept in the head of an ARTIFICIAL LIFEBODY without even telling a single soul somewhere something.
