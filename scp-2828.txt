**Item #:** SCP-2828

**Object Class:** --Safe-- Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2828 is currently uncontainable and is ubiquitous in global populations.  However, risk of breach of security or public discovery is deemed very low, as it is undetectable without the use of strong mnestics.

Undercover Foundation operatives posing as high-ranking employees in pharmaceutical and chemical manufacturing companies are to monitor any projects aimed at production of chemicals with mnestic capabilities, procure prototype batches to test for effectiveness at facilitating perception of SCP-2828, and either halt the research or allow it to continue based on the results.  Foundation operatives are to consistently search through Internet posts and scientific journals for anything that might be referring to SCP-2828 and investigate accordingly.  

Descriptions of SCP-2828's appearance, texture, sound, odor, or taste are to be tested for safety with D-class personnel by double-blind RAISA or antimemetics department personnel and redacted or expunged accordingly.

**Description:** SCP-2828 is an antimemetic and nearly undetectable part of the human body located behind the ear.  The role of SCP-2828 in bodily systems is virtually nonexistent, and is hypothesized to be fully vestigial.

SCP-2828 can only be perceived through the use of Class-W or stronger mnestics, but only to a limited degree if at all.  When it is perceived, it can only be perceived with one sense[[footnote]]As in sight, touch, hearing, smell, or taste.  Thermoception, proprioception, nociception, equilibrioception, and mechanoreception do not apply.[[/footnote]].  Whichever sense is used to perceive SCP-2828 first by a given subject is the only sense the subject will ever be able to perceive it with.  For example, if a subject saw SCP-2828 before he or she felt, heard, smelled, or tasted it, then the subject would not be able to ever feel, hear, smell, or taste it.  

This effect extends to all forms of communication; a subject who has seen SCP-2828 is unable to understand a written or verbal description of its smell, descriptions of the sound[[footnote]]Hypothesized to be related to the sound of a normal heartbeat.[[/footnote]] it makes, et cetera.  Amnestics are capable of erasing memories of SCP-2828, but the subject will still be unable to use any other sense than the one he or she first used to perceive it to perceive it again.  This is thought to be because SCP-2828 permanently alters the brain chemistries of those who perceive it.

A subject who has never observed SCP-2828 under the influence of mnestics can be told and fully comprehend information regarding SCP-2828 that uses more than one sense to describe it.  However, if said subject uses mnestics afterwards and attempts to observe SCP-2828 using any sense, [REDACTED].  It is therefore imperative that no Foundation personnel learn of any complex or relatively detailed description of SCP-2828's appearance, texture, sound, odor, or taste (see Special Containment Procedures).

Other than this, SCP-2828 poses no immediate danger and possesses no further anomalous properties.

> If you are reading this, then you have undergone enough memetic resistance conditioning, according to your credentials, to be safely permitted access to the following classified information.  However, due to the strong cognitohazardous nature of SCP-2828, some information must be left out for your safety.//–Dr. F██████████//

The anatomy of SCP-2828 is outwardly similar to that of the outer ear, possessing a small auricle.  It consists mainly of otherwise typical epidermal and dermal skin cells, with some internal cartilage and very minute amounts of fat, but no nerves or blood vessels.

SCP-2828-1 denotes cells that make up SCP-2828 instances.

No SCP-2828-1 instances observed thus far have ever made any movements whatsoever.  Chemical tests on SCP-2828-1 have produced no reactions on the part of SCP-2828-1; instead of interacting with molecules present in SCP-2828-1, all chemicals seem to "bounce off" the membrane.  Protein pumps and channels are nonfunctional in a similar manner.  Furthermore, no metabolic processes have been recorded to occur within SCP-2828-1 instances.  All SCP-2828-1 instances observed thus far are "frozen" in an identical manner.  As a result, all SCP-2828-1 instances are indestructible through conventional means.

An anomalous and indestructible substance, referred to as SCP-2828-2, found between SCP-2828-1 instances lock SCP-2828-1 in their set configuration.  The natures of SCP-2828-1 and SCP-2828-2 make SCP-2828 effectively indestructible, which has somewhat hindered research.

SCP-2828's small size makes it only effective as a defensive benefit against puncture wounds to a very specific area of the throat from a specific angle.  This makes it particularly effective at providing protection from ███████[[footnote]]A nocturnal and highly intelligent anomalous species that preyed on early humans.  They are known to have had large libraries dedicated to the study of human anatomy and behavior and controlled human populations like livestock.  They died off suddenly about ██████ years ago for previously unknown reasons.[[/footnote]] █████ and is speculated to have been evolved to suit this purpose.  Testing with SCP-████-EX, one of the last ████████, greatly supports this hypothesis.  ████████ had innate mnestic qualities and kept extensive records on human anatomy and behavior that they shared amongst themselves.  Because of this, SCP-2828 would have incapacitated these natural predators of early hominids while leaving normal early humans unharmed.  

With all ████████ now extinct, SCP-2828 serves no further obvious function and poses a significant cognitohazardous threat to Foundation personnel.  If a subject learns of complicated descriptions of SCP-2828 that use more than one sense and then uses mnestics to observe it firsthand, the subject will experience multiple tonic-clonic seizures, several strokes, and cerebral hemorrhaging.  It is therefore imperative that precautions be taken to avoid future complications.

**Addendum 2828-01:** SCP-2828 was discovered after Dr. A██████, a Foundation researcher and one of Site-██'s clinicians, was transferred to the antimemetics department in 19██.  As with all antimemetics department staff, she began a Class-W mnestic regimen.  She continued to act as a Site-██ clinician.  Two days later, on ██/██, Dr. A██████ performed a semiannual checkup on Agent F███ and noticed a peculiarity behind his ears.  When she touched the area, she was unable to receive any tactile stimulus whatsoever.  She touched the same area on herself with the same results.  Recognizing the obvious anomalous influence, she contacted Site Director S███████ immediately.

**Addendum 2828-02:** Following the events of 06/17/19██, all tests regarding SCP-2828 have been suspended by order of Site Director S███████.
