**Item #:** SCP-811

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-811 should be kept in a climate-controlled, cylindrical glass enclosure, between ten (10) and twenty (20) (inclusive) metres in diameter, filled to a depth of no less than two and a half (2.5) metres on average with mud, muck, and stagnant water. It is to be furnished with a variety of aquatic plants from its native swamp in █████, as the remaining vegetation there has exhibited the adaptation to regrow quickly from injuries endured during contact with SCP-811 as long as the roots are undamaged. [[footnote]]

 //I would like to briefly explain here that the (primarily-carnivorous) subject seems to have the forethought to leave areas of badly-damaged plants alone and rotate between areas within the enclosure, so, in my opinion, this course of action presents itself as a sensible expenditure of budget, with minimal upkeep costs and unnecessary loss of personnel over the long term. Now back to your normally-scheduled rundown of Special Containment Procedures.// ~Dr. Trebuchet 

-----

[[/footnote]] Water depth is not to exceed half a metre (0.5) at its lowest point. Height of the enclosure must be no less than five (5) metres above the highest soil point. Temperature is to be kept at 25°C, and humidity should be kept above 70%. There is to be a decontamination airlock chamber between the door into the enclosure and the door into the rest of the facility.[[footnote]]

 Both doors are required to form an airtight seal when closed. They must be designed so that when one door is open a secondary locking mechanism prevents the other door from being opened. The second door will not open until the first door is closed, its primary locking mechanism has been engaged and the atmosphere in the chamber has been fully exchanged to match that of the environment being entered. 

-----

[[/footnote]] Air that is ventilated into the enclosure should //not// be recirculated back into the rest of the facility, or the whole point of the decontamination chamber would become moot.

The enclosure must be tested daily for pH and microbe levels in both the soil and water, as well as for changes in chemical composition. Enclosure should be cleaned biweekly, preferably by D-class personnel, just in case. All discarded waste should be put in quarantine for analysis before disposal by standard biohazard protocol.

Subject is to be given at least 5 kg of live food 24 hours after its completion of its previous meal. Subject does not appear to be picky about the species of its prey, and it is recommended that personnel not enter the enclosure if SCP-811 has not fed in over 16 hours. 

All requests by the subject are to be reviewed by both overseeing Dr. Piffy Trebuchet and at least one Level 4 personnel before approval, and the review should not take more than 48 hours, unless exceptional circumstances dictate otherwise.

SCP-811 does not appear to be particularly aggressive unless it feels hungry or threatened, but safety precautions should still be taken, to avoid possible injury or infection. All personnel entering the enclosure must wear full-body, non-organic biohazard suits and breath masks, should include at least one guard for every two other personnel present, and no one should go in there alone. [[footnote]]

 No personnel are to enter the enclosure if they have open wounds or sores anywhere on their body, and those suffering from asthma or other respiratory-affecting conditions are prohibited from entering the enclosure without a note from a physician with Level 4 security clearance. 

-----

[[/footnote]] Upon exit of the enclosure into the decontamination chamber, a D-class personnel is to help remove all used biohazard suits and box them for quarantine until they can be sterilized for reuse. All samples taken must similarly be placed into sealed biohazard bins and examined under sterile conditions by personnel following all standard safety protocol for dealing with non-Keter biohazardous material. [[footnote]]

 **//Anyone attempting to bring heated elements, or, worse, an open flame into the enclosure will be terminated on sight.//** ~Dr. Trebuchet

[[/footnote]]

As far as research indicates, SCP-811 cannot cause serious injury to anyone properly wearing their biohazard suit. Anyone who removes any part of their suit while still in the enclosure, for any reason at all, will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including Keter reassignment.

    **Description:** SCP-811, superficially, is shaped similarly to a human female with gangly limbs and a slightly-bloated abdominal region. It's roughly 1.7 metres tall (5ft,7in), and weighs just under 47 kg due to its strange physiology (see Addendum 811-2 for details). Its skin has mild abrasive properties, and is a mottled green color that serves to camouflage it among the reeds in its natural habitat. Its sweat has been observed to act as a mild skin irritant. It has oily, green-black hair that has proven to be quite resistant to cleaning with conventional shampoos (See Addendum 811-1). Its eyes are colored with a muddle of earthy tones, and have round pupils. It shows partial comprehension of human language, and communicates through a combination of pantomime and raspy, awkwardly-constructed half-sentences and half-words.

Of particular note are the palms of its hands and the soles of its feet, which constantly secrete a clear, green-tinted “slime” with minor adhesive properties. This slime does not appear to have any effect on SCP-811's own tissue, but any other organic matter that it comes into contact with begins to die (if it was not already dead), and then undergo the decaying process at an alarming rate, through processes not fully understood, reducing the matter into a slightly viscous black liquid, which SCP-811 absorbs through its skin, directly into its “bloodstream”, which tests have shown consists almost entirely of black, decaying matter. [[footnote]]

Because of its high toxicity to human subjects and foul smell, Dr. Trebuchet has dubbed this substance "ichor".
-----
[[/footnote]]   Biopsies taken from SCP-811 have shown the presence of anaerobic bacteria in all examined cells, which, due to the apparent lack of anything resembling functional red blood cells in the subject, are currently presumed to be what SCP-811 uses to metabolise the chemicals in its ichor.

SCP-811 does not defecate or otherwise produce what we might recognize as being feces. Instead, cellular waste and substances it is unable to metabolise collect in its otherwise-unused stomach, where it is exposed to bacterial and chemical cocktails that cause it to congeal and fester into a grainy, tar-like substance that SCP-811 periodically regurgitates. All handling personnel should be aware that the subject is capable of weaponising this mechanism through voluntary projectile vomiting, will aim for the target's face or any perceived open wounds,  and has demonstrated upwards of 86% accuracy at distances of eight (8) metres. SCP-811 is, by and large, an ambush predator, and, much in the way that a Komodo dragon's bite will kill most creatures in days if left untreated, if SCP-811's vomit doesn't block up one's mouth and nose and cause death by asphyxiation, immediate and aggressive antibiotic treatment is needed to prevent the onset of massive infection leading to multi-systemic failure and death once it gets into the body through either a cut or mucous membrane. Likewise, SCP-811's “slime touch” will cause the rapid onset of cell necrosis and gangrene, which should be treated immediately to avoid unpleasant conditions such as sepsis.

    **Addendum 811-1:** To date, SCP-811 has requested:

* Regular delivery of human prey (denied)
* That we never let a crocodilian into its enclosure ever again (approved)
* The water be stocked with a variety of fish species from its native █████ (denied for budgetary reasons)
* One (1) hair brush, made of 100% synthetic materials (approved)
* For a (preferably D-class, just in case) personnel to, every other day, come in with a basin and showerhead to wash her hair. (approved); it has been noted that standard-strength hair shampoos do not adequately clean away the excessive oil in SCP-811's hair, and it has requested that something a little stronger be used (also approved).
[[footnote]] 
//Another note from Dr. Trebuchet: We're not sure when SCP-811 started caring about its hair, but it seems to have calmed down quite a bit now that it has something to do with its time, and hasn't been attacking the cleaning staff.//

* To be addressed by a two-syllable name that Dr. Trebuchet has transliterated as “Aé”, SCP-811 being illiterate, and thus not capable of choosing a spelling for itself (approved)

**Addendum 811-2:** Due to the fact that SCP-811 has lungs and teeth -- despite having no apparent use for either -- Dr. Trebuchet had it brought to Bio-Research Area-12's radiology lab for X-rays, to examine its internal structure. Results were inconclusive.

Subsequent MRI testing has revealed that SCP-811 has a number of [REDACTED], which assist in regulation of its [DATA EXPUNGED]. The possibility that SCP-811 was once [REDACTED] is being explored.
