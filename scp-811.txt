**Item #:** SCP-811

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-811 should be kept in a climate-controlled, cylindrical glass enclosure, between ten (10) and twenty (20) (inclusive) metres in diameter, filled to a depth of no less than two and a half (2.5) metres on average with mud, muck, and stagnant water. It is to be furnished with a variety of aquatic plants from its native swamp in █████, as the remaining vegetation there has exhibited the adaptation to regrow quickly from injuries endured during contact with SCP-811 as long as the roots are undamaged. [[footnote]]

 //I would like to briefly explain here that the (primarily-carnivorous) subject seems to have the forethought to leave areas of badly-damaged plants alone and rotate between areas within the enclosure, so, in my opinion, this course of action presents itself as a sensible expenditure of budget, with minimal upkeep costs and unnecessary loss of personnel over the long term.// ~Dr. Trebuchet 

-----

[[/footnote]] Water depth is not to exceed half a metre (0.5) at its lowest point. Height of the enclosure must be no less than five (5) metres above the highest soil point. Temperature is to be kept at 25°C, and humidity should be kept above 70%. There is to be a decontamination airlock chamber between the door into the enclosure and the door into the rest of the facility.[[footnote]]

Both doors are required to form an airtight seal when closed. They must be designed so that when one door is open a secondary locking mechanism prevents the other door from being opened. The second door will not open until the first door is closed, its primary locking mechanism has been engaged, and the atmosphere in the chamber has been fully exchanged to match that of the environment being entered. 

-----

[[/footnote]] Air that is ventilated into the enclosure should not be recirculated back into the rest of the facility under any circumstances

The enclosure must be tested daily for pH and microbe levels in both the soil and water, as well as for changes in chemical composition. Enclosure should be cleaned biweekly, preferably by D-class personnel. All discarded waste should be put in quarantine for analysis before disposal by standard biohazard protocol.

Subject is to be given at least 5 kg of live food 24 hours after its completion of its previous meal. Subject does not appear to be picky about the species of its prey, and it is recommended that personnel not enter the enclosure if SCP-811 has not fed in over 16 hours. 

All requests by the subject are to be reviewed by both overseeing Dr. Epiphany Trebuchet and at least one Level 4 personnel before approval, and the review should not take more than 48 hours, unless exceptional circumstances dictate otherwise.

SCP-811 does not appear to be particularly aggressive unless it feels hungry or threatened, but safety precautions should still be taken to avoid possible injury or infection. All personnel entering the enclosure must wear full-body, non-organic biohazard suits and breath masks, should include at least one guard for every two other personnel present, and no one should go in there alone. [[footnote]]

No personnel are to enter the enclosure if they have open wounds or sores anywhere on their body. Those suffering from asthma or other respiratory-affecting conditions are prohibited from entering the enclosure without a note from a physician with Level 4 security clearance. 

-----

[[/footnote]] Upon exit of the enclosure into the decontamination chamber, D-class personnel are to help remove all used biohazard suits and box them for quarantine until they can be sterilized for reuse. All samples taken must similarly be placed into sealed biohazard bins and examined under sterile conditions by personnel following all standard safety protocol for dealing with non-Keter biohazardous material. [[footnote]]

//Because the effects of SCP-811 on its environment cause a buildup of methane gas, anyone attempting to bring heated elements, or, worse, an open flame into the enclosure will be terminated on sight with as extreme prejudice as security can muster. "Premature specimen death by fireball" is unacceptable as an end result.// ~Dr. Trebuchet

[[/footnote]]

As far as research indicates, SCP-811 cannot cause serious injury to anyone properly wearing their biohazard suit. Anyone who removes any part of their biohazard suit while still in the enclosure, for any reason at all, will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including reassignment to a project that would not be adversely affected by their status as an amputee.

    **Description:** SCP-811, superficially, is shaped similarly to a human female with gangly limbs and a slightly-bloated abdominal region. It's roughly 1.7 metres tall (5ft,7in), and weighs just under 47 kg due to its strange physiology (see Addendum 811-2 for details). Its skin has slight abrasive properties, and is a mottled green color that serves to camouflage it among the reeds in its natural habitat. Its sweat has been observed to act as a mild skin irritant. It has oily black hair that has proven to be quite resistant to cleaning with conventional shampoos (See Addendum 811-1).  It shows partial comprehension of human language, consistent with case studies of "feral children" that had been abandoned at a few years old, instead of as infants.

Of particular note are the palmoplantar surfaces of its skin, which constantly secrete a clear, green-tinted mucus with minor adhesive properties. This mucus does not appear to have any effect on SCP-811's own tissue, but any other organic matter that it comes into contact with begins to rapidly decompose, through processes not fully understood, reducing the matter into a slightly viscous black liquid. [[footnote]]Prognosis and procedure for personnel who have come into contact with SCP-811's mucus is the same as for naturally-occurring necrosis and gangrene once the mucus has been washed off.
-----[[/footnote]] SCP-811 can then absorb said liquid through its skin and directly into its circulatory system. Tests have shown that SCP-811's entire circulatory system is filled with liquefied decaying matter. [[footnote]] Due to its high toxicity to human subjects, foul smell, and marked dissimilarity to blood as most people think of it, Dr. Trebuchet has, as a shorthand, dubbed the substance that runs through SCP-811's circulatory system "ichor".
-----
[[/footnote]] Viscosity-regulating glands exist at many points throughout SCP-811's body (see Medical Report SCP-811-05 for more details). Biopsies taken from SCP-811 have shown the presence of anaerobic bacteria in all examined cells, which, due to the apparent lack of anything resembling functional red blood cells in the subject, are currently presumed to be what SCP-811 uses to metabolise the chemicals in its "ichor".

SCP-811 does not defecate or otherwise produce feces in the traditional sense, and entirely lacks a small or large intestine. Instead, cellular waste and substances SCP-811 is unable to metabolise collect in what is, anatomically speaking, its stomach. Within the stomach, enzymes and bacterial flora cause it to congeal and fester into a grainy, tar-like substance that SCP-811 periodically voids by regurgitation. All handling personnel should be cautioned that the subject is an ambush predator that uses this mechanism to hunt. It preferentially aims at the face or at any perceived open wounds on its target, then waits for the target to die of either immediate asphyxiation by blockage of the mouth and nose, or in a few days of multi-systemic failure resulting from aggressive bacterial infection.

Prognosis for personnel who have had contact with SCP-811's waste through a mucous membrane or open wound is good if broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy is begun in the first three hours, but then rapidly declines. Personnel who are D-Class or have gone 12 hours without getting treatment may request termination.





    **Addendum 811-1:** To date, SCP-811 has requested:

* Regular delivery of human prey (denied)
* That we never let a crocodilian into its enclosure ever again (approved)
* The water be stocked with a variety of fish species from its native █████ (denied for budgetary reasons)
* One (1) hair brush, made of 100% synthetic materials (approved)
* For a (preferably D-class, just in case) personnel to, every other day, come in with a basin and showerhead to wash her hair. (approved); it has been noted that standard-strength hair shampoos do not adequately clean away the excessive oil in SCP-811's hair, and it has requested that something a little stronger be used (also approved).
[[footnote]] 
//Another note from Dr. Trebuchet: We're not sure when SCP-811 started caring about its hair, but it seems to have calmed down quite a bit now that it has something to do with its time, and hasn't been attacking the cleaning staff.//

[[/footnote]]
* To be addressed by a two-syllable name that Dr. Trebuchet has transliterated as “Aé”, SCP-811 being illiterate, and thus not capable of choosing a spelling for itself (approved)

**Addendum 811-2:** Due to the fact that SCP-811 has lungs and teeth -- despite having no apparent use for either -- Dr. Trebuchet had it brought to Bio-Research Area-12's radiology lab for X-rays, to examine its internal structure. Results were inconclusive.

Subsequent MRI testing has revealed that SCP-811 has a number of [REDACTED], which assist in regulation of its [DATA EXPUNGED]. The possibility that SCP-811 was once [REDACTED] is being explored.
