++++ __**Special Containment Procedures**__
[[/div]]
 At this time, due to the widespread cultural impact of SCP-030-J, containment is considered inadviseable.  As such, SCP-030-J is to be considered uncontained until further notice, with a possible change to Euclid if the specific vector of infection can be quarantined.  

As of the death of the carrier, SCP-030-J will be considered neutralized after the death of all humans who witnessed SCP-030-J's infection vector prior to May 16, 1990.

++++ __**Description**__
[[/div]]
SCP-030-J is a specific combination of sounds, that causes a mild compulsory effect upon subsequent hearings of the trigger phrase.  This compulsory effect is a call and response of several phrases, with no other significant cognitive effects.

At this time, Foundation scientists are unsure if SCP-030-J is a memetic effect of the original carrier, or a simple infohazard.  Data points to the former, as SCP-030-J infections have sharply declined since the death of the original infection vector, PoI-2844.

SCP-030-J reached near-epidemic levels due to the actions of PoI-2844 during 1969.  All infected human subjects became carriers of SCP-030-J and spread the infection further.  Further infections from these carriers did not produce the same carrier effect.  It is projected SCP-030-J will be neutralized by 2090.

Foundation agents are still in the process of uncovering the original cause of SCP-030-J within PoI-2844 with little success.

[[collapsible show="▶ Transcript of Interview between Agent Joaqin Kasim and PoI-2844" hide="Close Transcript"]]

The following interview was recorded in 1971 between Agent Joaqin Kasim, and PoI-2844.  It had come to Foundation attention that SCP-030-J was being spread deliberately by PoI-2844.  Due to the celebrity nature of PoI-2844, containment of PoI-2844 was considered untenable with the Foundation level of technology and amnestics available at the time.

> **Agent Kasim:** “So, you were aware that SCP-030-J was anomalous at the time you infected several million people?"
> 
> **PoI-2844:** “I was, actually.  I don’t feel particularly bad either, it was hell for me before I did it.”
> 
> **Agent Kasim:** “What do you mean by that?”
> 
> **PoI-2844:** “So, it’s not a big deal for all of you, if I go--” 
> 
> **PoI-2844 speaks the trigger phrase.  Agent Kasim repeats the counter phrases and expresses mild annoyance.**
> 
> **Agent Kasim:** “Please don’t do that again, I don’t appreciate being compelled.”
> 
> **PoI-2844:** “Sorry, I just find it funny.  Before, I would be muttering m- 
> 
> **Agent Kasim holds up a hand** 
> 
> **PoI-2844:** "Sorry.  The phrase, constantly.  I was going out of my gourd, I thought I was gonna end up in a padded room. "
> 
> **Agent Kasim:** “So you decided to infect millions of people.”
> 
> **PoI-2844:** “Well, every time someone else gave back the response, I felt a little better.  It came out less and less.  I figured if you had a million or so people doing it, I’d get a little peace.”
> 
> **Agent Kasim:** “Okay, last question.  Did the TV show come before, or after SCP-030-J infected you?”
> 
> **PoI-2844 chuckles**
> 
> **PoI-2844: “Before, actually.”**
