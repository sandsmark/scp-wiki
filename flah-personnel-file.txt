title:Flah Personnel File
**Name:** Agent Agent Flah

**Security Clearance:** Level 2

**Known History:** When first recruited to join the Foundation, Agent Flah was asked about the origins of his name. This was claimed to be a family tradition, as recounted to him by his father, Artist, his uncle, Electrician, and his grandfather, Soldier. Despite this seeming to be legitimate, it is still odd that every male member of his family ultimately entered the same career that was indicated by their name. Furthermore, there are no known etymological roots to his surname, Flah. All that is known by the Flah family is that it was "not a typo".
