**Item #:** SCP-1011

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1011 is allowed to freely roam the facility should it desire to, but otherwise must stay in its pen. Subject is not allowed out of its pen at night or off facility grounds at any time. Pen is to be kept clean and food replaced twice daily. All personnel are allowed inside SCP-1011’s holding area, but only if they are not assigned to other tasks at the time, or if they are on break. Subject is to be played with when bored and spoken to in a calm, non-threatening tone.

**Description:** SCP-1011 appears to be a large, amorphous, gelatinous mass of translucent orange slime, weighing about 54.43kg (120lbs) pounds with a consistency similar to that of peanut butter. Subject’s size and shape constantly changes, though most of the time its form is the size of a large beanbag chair. Composition of subject SCP-1011 is oil-based, but consists of a substance unknown to modern science. Other than a thin, transparent membrane surrounding the orange mass, subject appears to have no other organs to speak of.

Subject’s temperament is best described as playful and dog-like: when approached, subject SCP-1011 will react with overwhelming elation, slithering over to the nearest person and leaping upon them, “hugging” them with a pair of pseudopods while nuzzling the person’s face with a third pseudopod, all the while emitting high-pitched gurgling and cooing noises. The surface of SCP-1011 has found to emit a pleasing odor that differs with whomever she is interacting with. Recorded scents include chocolate, fresh laundry, bacon, roses, and Play-Doh™.

Simply touching SCP-1011’s surface causes an immediate euphoria, which intensifies the longer one is exposed to SCP-1011, and lasts long after being separated from the creature. Subject’s favorite activity is tickle-wrestling, often by completely enveloping a person from the neck down and tickling them until asked to stop (though it does not always comply with this request).

While the creature will interact with anyone, it seems to have a special interest in those who are unhappy or hurt in any way. Persons suffering from crippling depression, after interacting with SCP-1011, have returned completely cured with a very positive outlook on life. The possibility to market SCP-1011’s slime as an antidepressant has been discussed.

In addition to its playful behavior, SCP-1011 seems to love all animals (especially humans), refusing to eat any meat and even risking its own life to save others, even leaping in front of a person to take a bullet fired at them (Subject’s intellect is still up for debate- though its behavior is infantile, it seems to understand human speech and most modern technology, including guns). The creature’s diet consists entirely of candy and sweets, with M&M’s™ and Necco™ wafers being its favorites. Its eating methods are similar to that of an amoeba.


**Addendum SCP-1011-A:** The following is a report from an experiment in which [[[SCP-682]]] is exposed to SCP-1011 in the hopes that it will curb the creature’s omnicidal rage.

> (SCP-1011 is released into SCP-682’s containment area. SCP-1011 immediately slithered towards SCP-682)
> 
> 1011: (elated gurgles)
> 
> 682: (unintelligible groans, growling) What is that? 
> 
> (SCP-1011 moves in front of SCP-682, jumping up and down in a dog-like manner while calling out in a high-pitched squealing noise)
> 
> 682: (groans) Disgusting…
> 
> (SCP-682 immediately steps on SCP-1011, completely flattening SCP-1011. Observers were about to abort the experiment until SCP-682 started talking again)
> 
> 682: (grunts) Hmmm? (unintelligible) what is this... (low noise, similar to light chuckle) I feel all… tingly inside…
> 
> (SCP-1011 can be seen crawling up from between SCP-682’s toes, up along its side and around its neck, where it clung on and began gently nuzzling with its pseudopod. A wide grin slow spreads across SCP-682’s face)
> 
> 682: (deep chuckling) I feel… so… happy. Happy… (laughs) happy… happy…
> 
> (SCP-682 repeats the word “happy” for several minutes, laughing occasionally before escalating into nonstop laughter. As laughter continues, SCP-682 rolled around on its back, slamming its tail upon the floor with dangerous force)
> 
> 682: (bellowing laughter) Stop! No tickling! (continues laughing)
> 
> SCP-682 and SCP-1011 continue the “tickle fight” until SCP-682 finally wears down and appears to fall asleep with what would appear to be a smile on its face. Fifteen minutes later with no activity, Two D-Class agents enter the room to retrieve SCP-1011. Once SCP-1011 was removed, SCP-682 immediately woke up and unleashed an unidentifiable wave of energy from its body, all the while laughing maniacally. 
> 
> All persons within the wave’s range collapsed into crippling fits of laughter, allowing SCP-682 to escape and slaughter all in its path while SCP-1011 quickly rescued as many persons as it could, taking them to a safe place to recover from SCP-682’s "laughter wave" while Agents suppressed and re-contained SCP-682. 
> 
> Despite the tragedy that SCP-682 had brought upon the facility, SCP-1011 has not shown any fear towards the creature and in fact has made gestures suggesting it wanted to “play” with SCP-682 again. SCP-682, however, had stated in a later interview, “That feculent little snot wad can suck my [DATA EXPUNGED]

//Memo from Dr. ████: “While the test was unsuccessful and ended in tragedy, that had to be the funniest thing I had ever seen. I never thought I’d see the day when I would regard SCP-682 as “cute”. Please send me a copy of the security tapes ASAP.”//
