**Project #:** SPC-3733[[footnote]] If you are reading this document and these words mean anything to you, there is still hope.[[/footnote]]

**Selachian Pugnātorial Capabilities:** The purpose of SPC-3733 is to initiate a KO-Class Global-Pugnation Scenario, converting 98%[[footnote]] My name is Researcher Haru Akimoto, I work in the SPC Anti-Memetology Division.[[/footnote]] of the human population to an anti-selachian ideology. The converted population will begin supporting anti-selachian laws and practices, along with an exponential increase in selachian pugnātorial participation from the public.

**Project Component(s):**[[footnote]] While experimenting on new anti-memes, I was exposed to a cerebral-reset anti-memetic agent, and I have learned a grave truth.[[/footnote]]

The Centre's Memetology Division developed 6 auditory memetic agents specifically designed for SPC-3733. The six memetic agents were condensed to form a 1 minute 59 second mp3[[footnote]]The SPC organization is currently under the influence of an unknown force, twisting our purpose to fit its own sick agenda.[[/footnote]] audio file classified as Meme-3733.  Human subjects exposed to Meme-3733 will hear an orchestral composition consisting of various instruments. During exposure, individuals experience a subconscious shift to a Centre-developed anti-selachian ideology. The subject affected will have no awareness a change has taken place and will consider all implanted ideologies to be authentic naturally-occurring beliefs.[[footnote]] I do not know when it started and I don't know what it is, but it has control.[[/footnote]]


Using cutting-edge nanotechnology[[footnote]]All I know is what it wants. It wants us to punch sharks.[[/footnote]] and several deviant components, the F.I.N. (Frequency Integration Network) Device is capable of transmitting Meme-3733 over ranges of up to 40,000km. Within the range specified, any human[[footnote]] It's literally insane, nothing we do or say makes sense.[[/footnote]] with cerebral functionality will hear Meme-3733 through telepathic auditory implantation.                  

**Enhancement Summary:** The Anti-Memetology Division has prepared counter-meme 3733-Old-Punch, for distribution amongst Centre personnel. This 59-second memetic inoculation will prevent any aggression-saturation effects among Centre personnel.[[footnote]] We all need to wake up, before it's too late.[[/footnote]]

**Deployment Record:** After 47 years of development, SPC-3733 was declared operational, on  8/14/2019. Approval to continue the project is currently pending.

> **Mr. Daniels:** Yeah, yeah, no problem, listen I was told there was gonna be money? I was just wondering if I get paid before or after?

> **Mr. Daniels:** Sharks? //[Subject laughs]// What type of medical study is this again?

> **Dr. Philips:** Mr. Daniels, I assure you there is nothing funny about this, please answer the questions, so we can begin the procedure[[footnote]] We need your help. [[/footnote]].
>  
> **Mr. Daniels:** Right, whatever you say Doc. //[Subject clears his throat]// No, I have never helped any sharks or shark people.

> **Dr. Philips:** Good Mr. Daniels, now how does this picture make you feel?

>  //[Dr. Philips holds up a picture of a Hammer-Class selachian entity.]//
> 
> **Mr. Daniels:** //[Subject fights back laughter]// Um, I don't know man, fine? It's a good picture if that's what you mean.
> 
> **Dr. Philips:** Great, thank you. We can begin the procedure now. I'm going to have you listen to a short piece of music, then I will ask you a few more questions.

>  
> **Dr. Philips:** Yes, Mr. Daniels, that's when you get paid.

> **Mr. Daniels:** Fuck sharks.
> 
> **Dr. Philips:** Excellent, Mr. Daniels, I'd like to keep you here for a few days, so we can monitor for any side effects. There will be no monetary compensation, but we have several selachian entities you could punch. 
> 
> **Mr. Daniels:** I mean, I feel fine, but whatever you say Doc, that sounds fucking radical.
> 
> **<END LOG>**[[footnote]] I'm not sure we ever really were.[[/footnote]]
> 
> **Closing Statement:** Subject experienced complete anti-selachian conversion, showing no signs of negative side effects. Mr. Daniels is under the impression that all implanted beliefs are organic life-long convictions.
> These results remained consistent for all SPC-3733 tests on civilian subjects.
