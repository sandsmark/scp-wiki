**Item #:** SCP-2683

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2683 is to be monitored by a dedicated research team. Any instances of animals of the //Proboscidea// order entering the anomaly are to be noted. Due to the isolated nature of SCP-2683, confrontation with civilians over containment is unlikely, but as a precaution signs are to be posted at the perimeter stating that the area contains large amounts of hazardous subterranean gases. 

If any specimens not native to the area perish while in SCP-2683, the bodies are to be collected for analysis. After analysis, the bodies are to be incinerated. Genetic samples are to be stored in a safe environment. 

**Description:** SCP-2683 designates a forest clearing located in ████████ National Park, India. The clearing is 0.6km^^2^^ in size, and is populated by local fauna. The clearing contains a large pond which is seemingly impervious to evaporation. The pond exists in a liquid state permanently, and always retains the same volume.

SCP-2683 is subject to a temporal and spatial anomaly. Various specimens of the order //Proboscidea// have been seen to materialise on the edge of the clearing before making their way down to the pond in the centre. Both species not native to the area and species which are extinct have been seen to materialise. Each specimen seems to exhibit the same behaviour pattern - they touch their trunks on the surface of the water before expelling large amounts of lacrimal fluid from the eyes. Some individuals have been seen placing branches on the surface of the pond. The specimens that materialise will often de-materialise after an inconsistent amount of time - however, specimens have been known to stand at the water until they perish from hunger or thirst. A complete log of the species seen to materialise in SCP-2683 is found below (not including species native to the area).

||~ Binomial Name/Common name ||~ Notes ||
|| //Loxodonta africana//, African bush elephant || Large in size, species vulnerable in the wild  ||
|| //Loxodonta cyclotis//, African forest elephant || Rarely seen in the wild ||
|| //Mammuthus// genus, presumed Columbian mammoth || Lived in plestiocene epoch, hairless mammoth spcies. An attempt to capture an instance of this species failed, as it de-materialised after leaving SCP-2683 ||
|| //Mammuthus exilis//, pygmy mammoth || Extinict dwarf species. Only existed on the islands of Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, and San Miguel[[footnote]]Three of the Channel Islands[[/footnote]] ||
|| //Mammuthus primigenius//, woolly mammoth || Large, hairy. Instances of this species always arrive in large herds of 30-40 individuals ||
|| //Gomphotherium// genus || Instances of this species are fairly aggressive to personnel and have caused several minor injuries. Instances possess four tusks ||
|| //Anancus// genus || Specimens of this species possess extremely long tusks, the largest measured at 4.2 metres in length ||
|| //Moeritherium// genus || Primitive specimen from the Eocene, do not have tusks, and have a minuscule trunk ||
|| //Elephas celebensis//, Sulawesi dwarf elephant || Possess lower tusks. Instances do not appear very often ||
|| //Elephas maximus sumatranus//, Sumatran elephant || Smaller than most other species. One of the more common species sighted in SCP-2683 ||
|| None || Black in colouration, small, possessed flipper-like appendages, peaceful, geographical region unknown ||
|| None || Dark-orange, large incisors, five tusks, extremely aggressive. Injured several personnel ||
|| None ([[[SCP-2082|SCP-2082]]]) || Hairy, large, caused deaths of █ personnel through anomalous effects ||

**Addendum 1:** Researchers deployed a small aquatic drone to give a picture of the inside of the pond. The depth from the drone exploration was revealed to be around 15-17 metres. Footage revealed a large, elephantine skeleton is situated at the bottom of the pool, and a 2 person dive is planned to recover large amounts of bone for analysis.

**Update:** The two-man dive has been designated Incident-2683-A. Logs of this incident are found below.

> **Dr. Hamidou:** Get back here, Couzens. Quickly.

Further dives into the pond failed to locate Agent Dhawan. 

On ██/██/2017, agents in Colombo, Sri Lanka, discovered Agent Dhawan in a mental institution, where he was designated SCP-2683-1. Dhawan mimicked the mannerisms and behaviour of an elephant, and did not display any human behavioural traits. Staff at the institution stated that Dhawan had been found wandering the streets, and was apprehended after assaulting several civilians. It was noted from records that Agent Dhawan was born in Colombo. No further dives are planned.
