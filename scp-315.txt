**Item #:** SCP-315

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** Object does not require any special storage arrangements. However, it is currently kept in an opaque cardboard box, away from strong light or heat sources, under the assumption that this will slow the natural decay of any stored data on the object.

**Description:** Object consists of a set of ninety-five (95) standard 8.5GB recordable DVD-format discs, arranged in a stack on a black plastic spindle. Examination of the label side of each disc reveals no manufacturer's name. Printed into each matte label is the title "PoC 1/1". Beneath this, each disc carries a unique symbol or glyph. It is confirmed that no two discs carry the same symbol. Each label also has three engraved straight lines, such as those you would find on a 'normal' DVD-R, ostensibly intended as a place to write in a disc title.

On examination of the data side of the disc, it can be seen that each disc has already been fully written with data. Placing the disc into a computer or DVD player reveals that it is a standard-encoded video disc. Playing the disc results in one of two effects, depending on whether you use a previously watched disc, or an unwatched one.

If an unwatched disc is played in a DVD player, the video begins. The scene displayed is a well-furnished living room with a chair in the center. Sitting in the chair is a Caucasian male (SCP-315-1), appearing to be around forty years old. SCP-315-1 will then demonstrate the ability to react to and converse with anyone watching the video feed. SCP-315-1 will respond to any questions put to him, and appears to enjoy discussions and debates with 'viewers'. SCP-315-1 also seems to be able to see what is happening outside of the television set or computer monitor that he is displayed on. 

If a disc that has already been viewed is viewed again, the disc will simply repeat the footage that was seen the first time. SCP-315-1 will not react to viewers' actions, nor deviate at all from the previous viewing. No matter how many times a particular disc is played, or who watches it, it always contains the same footage. The only way to communicate with SCP-315-1 is to insert a disc that has never been watched. Given that there are 95 discs, each containing three hours of video, it follows that SCP-315-1 has an effective lifespan of 285 hours, or 11.8 days. Twelve discs are known to have been watched entirely in the facility since containment, therefore SCP-315-1 has 10.4 days of remaining 'reactive' time. It should also be noted here that SCP-315 is not the complete set of discs. At least one other is known to exist, and given the size of the spindle and roundness of the number, it seems reasonable to assume that there were originally one hundred discs, at least on that spindle.

SCP-315-1 is cognizant of the nature of his own existence. When questioned, he is aware that he is being displayed on a television screen or monitor, and can reliably identify the type, size and color of the device on which he is shown. When directly asked about his specific nature, however, SCP-315-1 will not give a straight answer, preferring to draw the viewer into a philosophical debate. It is not clear whether SCP-315-1 is withholding information about his origin, or whether he is uncertain himself. He claims the former, stating that to tell us everything would "spoil the game". He neither demonstrates nor admits to any unhappiness with his situation, nor his short lifespan.

SCP-315-1 retains memory between discs. If one viewer interacts with an unwatched disc, then switches to another disc, SCP-315-1 will recognise the viewer and refer to a previous conversation. SCP-315-1 has even shown signs of developing a rapport and friendship with those researchers who have spent a lot of time talking with him.

> 
> **Dr. █████ ███████:** Like what?
> 
> **SCP-315-1:** Well, for example, let's say that there's nothing at all paranormal or unusual about these discs. Let's say that they're ordinary DVDs with ordinary, unchanging video data on them.
> 
> **Dr. █████ ███████:** Well, the video data does change. 
> 
> **SCP-315-1:** Does it? 
> 
> **Dr. █████ ███████**: Yeah. When I talk, you know what I've said, and make a relevant answer. When we play the disc again, it's that same answer, so it's permanently changed.
> 
> **SCP-315-1:** My point is that you can't tell it's changed if you don't know what was on it before. It could be that the disc always had that answer on it.
> 
> **Dr. █████ ███████:** That's impossible.
> 
> **SCP-315-1:** Hah! Says the Foundation employee to the SCP.
> 
> **Dr. █████ ███████:** For that to work... for the discs to all be pre-recorded, you'd have to know what I was going to say, and do, exactly, years before I did it.
> 
> **SCP-315-1:** I suppose I would. I'd need to be a pretty decent psychic and clairvoyant, though. Or have some kind of future-extrapolation device. That would be improbable, but not impossible from a mathematical standpoint.
> 
> **Dr. █████ ███████:** Sufficiently improbable that I'd sooner believe the impossible.
> 
> **SCP-315-1:** Or, how about this? I could be from the future. I know what you're going to say because I have the records you're making, and can respond accordingly.
> 
> **Dr. █████ ███████:**  That makes no sense at all. It'd be... unimaginably paradoxical.
> 
> **SCP-315-1:** Mmm. Yeah, you're right, actually. The other problem, of course, is that I have very little motive to record 10 or so days worth of video just to screw with some SCP employee.
> 
> **Dr. █████ ███████:** So we've made no progress whatsoever.
> 
> **SCP-315-1:** Well, that's not entirely true. You've got some more ideas in your head about how these DVDs work, whether they're right or wrong. You have some new things to try and disprove.

> 
> **SCP-315-1:** Ah, maybe I do, and maybe I don't. It doesn't matter, anyway. I'm just wondering how you'd react to it.
> 
> **Dr. █████ ███████:** What do you mean?
> 
> **SCP-315-1:** Well, I was just thinking about our little discussions about what these discs are. Whether I'm really a conscious entity with an unusual way of existing, or whether you're talking to an impossible tape recording.
> 
> **Dr. █████ ███████:** So you're saying I couldn't throw a disc away because it might be needlessly shortening the lifespan of a living thing?
> 
> **SCP-315-1:** Haha! No. I mean it the other way. You couldn't throw a disc away because it might be a prediction. You'd have to know if the prediction was accurate. Whether the person who recorded the disc knew that you would throw one away, and knew exactly which one. And then, once you'd exhausted all the other discs, you'd have to find the last one, because if they knew one disc was going to be discarded, mightn't that be the one they recorded an answer on?
> 
> **Dr. █████ ███████:** (laughs again). Make your choice, adventurous stranger; strike the bell and bide the danger. Or wonder, 'till it drives you mad, what would have followed if you had.
> 
> **SCP-315-1:** Sounds about right.
> 
> **Dr. █████ ███████:** I still don't believe your "pre-recorded" ████████, by the way. It'd be easy for you to prove it and I know you'd love to lord it over me.

**Addendum 315-01:**
Experimented to see how SCP-315-1 responds to basic video playback functions.

Pause: Entire scene paused, including SCP-315-1. When resumed, SCP-315-1 was able to tell that he had been paused. SCP-315-1 then demonstrated the ability to respond, when resumed, to questions that had been asked during pause.
Rewind: Entire scene rewound, including SCP-315-1. When resumed, DVD played back SCP-315-1's side of previous discussion. SCP-315-1 did not respond to questioning until video had once again reached the furthest watched point. He then resumed normal conversation and requested not to be rewound again.
Fast forward: Whole scene fast-forwarded, including SCP-315-1, who sat still during sped-up play. SCP-315-1 picked up conversation immediately afterward, and requested not to be fast-forwarded again.
Slow forward: SCP-315-1 was able to react to conversation during slow play, but was slowed down himself. When normal playback resumed, he identified that he had been in slow motion, but noted that it made no perceivable difference to him.

**Addendum 315-02:**
Attempted to copy one of the unwatched DVDs. Was unsuccessful - disc contains some form of copy protection that nobody seems to be able to break. SCP-315-1 showed awareness of this attempt when next consulted, and made reference to 'cheating'.

**Addendum 315-03:**
SCP-315-1 made reference to discs possibly being pre-recorded. To attempt to disprove, played a disc "out of sequence", i.e., played a disc from the middle of the pile rather than in the top-to-bottom order previously used. No apparent effect - SCP-315-1 was still able to tell the current, real-world time, conversed normally, complimented researcher on guile.

**Addendum 315-04:**
Further attempt to prove or disprove pre-recording theory. A pseudo-random number generator was used. Displayed number to television screen. SCP-315-1 was able to read out the number. If video is pre-recorded, the algorithm used for event prediction is almost impossibly accurate. Seems far more likely that effect is due to some paranormal phenomenon in the discs themselves, although further suggestions to try and prove either hypothesis are encouraged.

Dr. █████ ███████’s note:
//I don’t like this conclusion at all. Without the ability to copy the disc, though, I can think of no way to prove either one hypothesis or the other. There are more important things to worry about at the Foundation, but this one keeps tugging at the back of my brain.//

**Addendum 315-05:**
Two DVD players set up in separate areas. One randomly selected unwatched DVD placed in each player. Both discs played simultaneously to two separate researchers. Each instance of SCP-315-1 engaged in a separate conversation with each researcher. Both instances also showed awareness of the other conversation, and were able to transfer a message from one researcher to another.

**Addendum 315-06:**
Two DVD players set up in same room, played to two researchers sitting side-by-side. Dual instances of SCP-315-1 able to communicate both with researchers and with each other, creating a four-way conversation. When asked whether they were two separate entities or one entity controlling both instances, the SCP-315-1s were either unable or unwilling to give an answer.

Dr. █████ ███████’s note:
//This is driving me up the damn wall. I’m taking myself off this project for the moment. No psych evaluation required, I’m just getting stressed out trying to figure out how the damn discs work.//
