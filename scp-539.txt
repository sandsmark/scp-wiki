**Item #:** SCP-539

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-539 is to be kept in a padded case, to remain locked at all times, unless a supervisor with a minimum Security Clearance Level of 2 is present to observe, and only during potential testing of its phenomena. Physical contact with SCP-539 is forbidden unless approved testing is being conducted.

**Description:** Object is a small, round disc composed of an undetermined material. When thrown, it will create a distraction of any variety that will draw attention away from its thrower. These distractions have no observable pattern, and are varied. Due to the unpredictable nature of SCP-539, testers are advised to throw it as far as possible from themselves. Class as of yet is Euclid, though may be changed to Keter, as the possibility of an end-of-the-world scenario-style distraction has been proposed by multiple researchers in charge of testing for SCP-539.

**Addendum:** __Test Notes__

**Test 539-1:** Security personnel ordered to line up all with clear lines of sight on tester, with instructions to not break eye contact with tester under any circumstances. When the disc was thrown, the security personnel experienced a "sudden wardrobe existence failure", causing all of them to lose eye contact with the tester, being more concerned with the loss of clothing and the issue of the climate being rather uncomfortable to a nude security guard.

**Test 539-2:** Tester was dressed in bright and eye catching clothing for this test. Tester was alone with security personnel in an empty office. Security personnel ordered to maintain constant eye contact with tester. When the disc was thrown, the entire building's fire alarm triggered and could not be turned off until the disc was retrieved and the computer security system reset.

**Test 539-3:**  Class D personnel given instructions to "attract the attention of the local authorities" then make use of the SCP. Personnel chased by Police after smashing in a Law Cruiser's window. When thrown, a large animal of the species Carcharhinus leucas (Bull Shark) appeared in the way of the pursuing Police cars, who were forced to stop and investigate. After Class D personnel debriefed, both the Bull Shark and the SCP were retrieved by field agents. It is worth noting that the Police Officers involved have remained firmly silent to their superiors about the incident.
