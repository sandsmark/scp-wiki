    **Description:**
Object is a round disc made out of an undetermined material. When thrown, object will create a distraction of any variety that will take attention away from the thrower. Distractions have no apparent pattern and are varied. Due to the unpredictable nature of the object, testers are advised to throw it as far as possible from themselves. Class as of yet indetermined as the possibility of an end-of-the-world scenario distraction has been put forward.

**Test Notes**
__1__
Security personnel ordered to line up all with clear lines of sight on tester, with instructions to not break eye contact with tester under any circumstances. When the disc was thrown, the security personnel experienced a "sudden wardrobe existence failure", causing all of them to lose eye contact with the tester, being more concerned with the loss of clothing and the issue of the climate being rather uncomfortable to a nude security guard.
