**Item #:** SCP-539

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-539 is to be kept in a padded case, to remain locked at all times, unless a supervisor with a Security Clearance Level of at least 2. Physical contact with SCP-539 is forbidden unless approved testing or usage is in progress.

**Description:** Object is a small round disc made out of an undetermined material. When thrown, object will create a distraction of any variety that will take attention away from the thrower. Distractions have no apparent pattern and are varied. Due to the unpredictable nature of the object, testers are advised to throw it as far as possible from themselves. Class as of yet is Euclid, though may be changed to Keter, as the possibility of an end-of-the-world scenario-style distraction has been put forward.

**Addendum:** __Test Notes__

**Test 539-1:** Security personnel ordered to line up all with clear lines of sight on tester, with instructions to not break eye contact with tester under any circumstances. When the disc was thrown, the security personnel experienced a "sudden wardrobe existence failure", causing all of them to lose eye contact with the tester, being more concerned with the loss of clothing and the issue of the climate being rather uncomfortable to a nude security guard.

**Test 539-2:** Tester was dressed in bright and eye catching clothing for this test. Tester was alone with security personnel in an empty office. Security personnel ordered to maintain constant eye contact with tester. When the disc was thrown, the entire building's fire alarm triggered and could not be turned off until the disc was retrieved and the computer security system reset.
