**Item #:** SCP-XXX

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-XXX is to be kept entirely manacled to his sleeping quarters to the point of near-total immobility. If SCP-XXX's enclosure is seen to be empty, top priority must be placed on immediate recapture. Locomotion or simple twitch-response behavior exhibited by SCP-XXX is to be noted and reported to research and emergency staff.
If SCP-XXX's legs or arms are in working order, they must be broken immediately to prevent sleepwalking in the event of escape [see Addendum XXX-A]; the neck, however, cannot be broken, due to the risk of death [see Addendum XXX-B]. Instead, it must be held immobile by a brace covering up to the chin and down to the shoulders. Restraints are not to be unfastened at any time for any purpose, and the room is not to be opened for anything but standard research purposes unless emergency conditions require it. Maintenance crews and D-class are also to be kept away from the enclosure unless otherwise noted.

**Description:** SCP-XXX is presently an American male of the approximate age of 14; no applicable birth certificate has yet been found, so all relevant personal information is the product of hypotheses and the subject of guesswork. His basal metabolic rate is comparable to that of a blue whale or a mammal of greater size, but mass is slightly below average for humans of similar ages. Despite ignorance of all other bodily needs, and despite attempted interference on the part of researchers, SCP-XXX has yet to be observed in a state of consciousness apart from Stage N3 dreamless sleep. For the entire duration of containment, SCP-XXX has ingested no food or water and has passed no waste; what has kept him alive for so long is still under study.

Even asleep, SCP-XXX has been known to speak on rare occasions. Little of what is said is intelligible, and that which can be heard is typically incoherent, similar to the speech of a person in the grip of delirium. Portions have been recorded for future research; no noticeable difference in the movement of SCP-XXX-1 has been noted during these periods.

Whenever SCP-XXX moves in any capacity, one or more of a number of celestial objects, mostly asteroids, move as well. The estimated nineteen objects [heretofore collectively named SCP-XXX-1] vary in diameter from 1.5 km to 406.6 km- the largest of these is roughly 133% the size of the object that caused the largest recorded terrestrial impact crater. Regardless of the direction of SCP-XXX's motion, SCP-XXX-1 only ever moves toward Earth. A twitch of a finger or toe typically corresponds to a movement of about 140 kilometers; comparable movement of a limb indicates motion of SCP-XXX-1 on the scale of 460 km or more. Sustained motion, such as sleepwalking, has been demonstrated to correlate with the objects traveling toward Earth at velocities reaching 280,000 kilometers per hour. The rise and fall of SCP-XXX's chest unfortunately must not be stopped, and corresponds with a movement in the celestial objects to the degree of 10 km per respiratory cycle.

If SCP-XXX is killed, it is assumed that someone with similar abilities will appear someplace else on the planet [see Addendum XXX-B]. Due to the difficulty and danger of having to find such an individual with no initial leads, it is stressed that killing SCP-XXX is never an acceptable course of action.

**Addendum XXX-A** On a number of occasions, SCP-XXX has been freed from his restraints by unknown means. No physical presence has been seen to cause this, and the restraints themselves have only ever looked as though they remained untouched during these. Because of this, it is yet uncertain whether it is his own doing that he escapes, or that an outside force is interfering without being noticed. In such an event as this, all available resources at Site ██ must be directed toward SCP-XXX's location, recovery, and placement into his enclosure.

**Addendum XXX-B** The designation SCP-XXX was formerly given to a middle-aged woman from ███████, Guatemala, with a condition identical to that of the current designee. She, too, was also found with no personal history and with no connection to any people in the surrounding area, despite having lived in a small and closely-knit community. After the realization of her connection with SCP-XXX-1 and her coming into care of the Foundation, every step that could be taken to stop her from moving was carried out. This included the routine breaking of the limbs and neck and the use of a tight-fitting full-body cast as a contingency measure; both she and the present SCP-XXX have been known to escape confinement, so keeping major bones nonfunctional was used as a way to keep their movements slow when containment was breached. However, on ██/██/19██, complications from a pair of fractured vertebrae proved fatal. SCP-XXX-1 was noted to have stopped moving as well, and after several months without any change the Foundation presumed the matter closed.

On ██/██/19██, motion of SCP-XXX-1 restarted. A thorough search of sleep disorder clinics returned the result of the current designee after twenty-two days; he was taken into custody immediately and subjected to revised containment policies that prevented the breaking of the neck. SCP-XXX-1 had moved a total distance of █████ km from the start of the search to its finish, and has moved an estimated ████ km during his stay at the Foundation.
