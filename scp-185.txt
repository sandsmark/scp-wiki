**Item #:**SCP-185

**Object class:**Safe (Euclid class considered after incident 185-1. See document 185-1 for details)

**Special Containment Procedures:**

SCP-185 is to be kept in a soundproof room with noise-filtering microphones for monitoring purposes. Standard guard procedures are to be used for this object. Ear-defenders must be worn on all occupants in the chamber, except test subjects.

**Description:**

SCP-185 appears to be a Russian R-105M radio used during the cold war. except that it has a crudely added keypad and LCD screen. The object can receive most radio transmission including encrypted signals. SCP-185 also has a very long range surpassing even modern radio equipment. Functions as a normal radio until input is added via the keypad. It seems that if a year is entered into the keypad the radio will receive transmissions from the era (depending on if messages were being broadcasted on the set frequency) This function was discovered when entering the random number of 1939 and and Neville Chamberman was heard declaring war on Germany. The possibility of entering dates and times have been noted and are being researched. On the inside the radio is unaltered, the key pad is contained in a box affixed to the side of the radio. Researchers cannot access the keypad due to the box being made from a metal that is yet to be identified. It cannot be cut and  there are no determinable ways to disassemble it.

**Addendum:**

**Document #185-1:Accident 1**

During a test the year was set to -13.73 billion during the time the universe was suspected to have been created. Sound volumes could not be measured. Survivors further from the incident reported rumbling sounds similar to recorded sounds from the sun. All those within 200 meters of the epicenter died of asphyxiation within 12 hours. Sound waves had ruptured capillaries in the lungs and victims basically drowned in their own blood.
