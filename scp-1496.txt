title:SCP-1496
(placeholder while I get it transferred from the sandbox...)

SCP-1496 is the avatar of megahuigurius, a large creature that lives at the bottom of the marianais tranch. It lives down there, but it is alive, because no one KNOWS that it lives down there. It is very large and angry, and it should not be annoyed, because it willl RISE UP and eat all of those who stand in its way.

It is controlled by a 14 year old caulcausian male (who cannot read guidess) that uses a specaial headbagd descigned by his step father who saved him frow an abusive grandparent. It gives them the power to CONTROL SCP-1496, which is very powerful.

The 14 year old boy (named Timothy) is to be given:

* all the xboxes and halos games
* four meals a day and snacks
* a pretty girl to blow him lol
* DOESN'T HAVE TO GO TO BED AT 10:00 PM

This keeps Timothy using not the monster for evil, but good, so you should so it because.

The moster is a snake thing that breathes fire and has bat winds so it can fly.
