**Item #:** SCP-1032

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1032 is to be kept in a secure room with one unarmed guard posted inside the room at all times.

A microscope camera must watch the front of SCP-1032 at all times. The footage from this camera is to be searched daily for any moments when any hand of the clock passes over the number twelve (12), at which point, the new measurement for that hand must be written down and its speed and arrival time calculated. (See description)

**Description:** SCP-1032 is a silver alarm clock of unknown origin and maker. The clock is made from silver, plastic, and glass has twenty-two (22) hands of various sizes and shapes.

SCP-1032 does not have any actual relation to normal time measurement. Every hand instead measures the time until a specific moment will end; an inscription written in white text on its front, in various sizes ranging from barely legible to microscopic, describes what the moment is or will be. When that hand reaches the twelve o'clock marker, that moment will be over.

When the hand has reached twelve o'clock, the text will spontaneously change to something new, and the hand's speed will change so that it will display the end of this new event at the correct time. SCP-1032 has never been wrong to date and has predicted countless deaths, downfalls, as well as the beginning of the ███████ ███. The date of the event that is described on each hand can be calculated ahead of time by measuring the speed and distance which the hand must travel.

Each hand is referred to as SCP-1032-01 through -1032-22, in order of size from smallest to largest.

The following is a documentation on each hand and what its current inscription is. A full log of all relevant past inscriptions can be found at [FILE ACCESS RESTRICTED]

> SCP-1032-01
> Current text: SCP-1032-01 rotates too fast to have a constant measurement.
> Date calculated: N/A
> Notes: SCP-1032-01's only recorded text to date has been one of the three following: "A thought." "A sound." or "A sensation."

> SCP-1032-02
> Current text: "The worst thing that will ever happen to anybody."
> Date calculated: Hand moves too slowly to be calculated.
> Notes: Due to the vagueness of this description, and the impossibility to calculate the time it will take, no research has been conducted on SCP-1032-02.

> SCP-1032-03
> Current text: "The moment when you will decide to promote me to a euclid class threat."
> Date calculated: 02/06/2012
> Notes: Dr. Guenther has suggested that, due to SCP-1032's seeming self-awareness, it should be promoted to a euclid class threat. This suggestion is awaiting review on the 2nd of june.

> SCP-1032-04
> Current text: "The Universe."
> Date calculated: [DATA EXPUNGED]
> Notes: It is unknown whether this refers to the actual end of our universe, or perhaps the end of anything which is referred to as 'the universe'.

> SCP-1032-05
> Current text: "A failed infomercial."
> Date calculated: N/A
> Notes: SCP-1032-05 moves very quickly and usually cycles anywhere between two to five times a day. To date is has never displayed anything other than "A failed infomercial."

> SCP-1032-06
> Current text: "Freedom of the Press."
> Date calculated: 16/05/2073
> Notes: SCP-1032-06 does not specify what country(ies) freedom of the press will end in.

> SCP-1032-07
> Current text: "Humor."
> Date calculated: 22/03/2052
> Notes: N/A

> SCP-1032-08
> Current text: "The last time anyone will use the phrase 'You can say that again.'"
> Date calculated: 22/03/2267
> Notes: N/A

> SCP-1032-09
> Current text: "Hostile relations between the various countries and states of Africa."
> Date calculated: [DATA EXPUNGED]
> Notes: Although it was initially assumed that this refers to peace between all African nations, SCP-1032 has often made very morbid predictions in what seemed like harmless phrases, so it is considered equally likely that something will happen which may wipe out all (or most of) Africa.

> SCP-1032-10
> Current text: "Jason W. Tailor (Junior)'s sister's daughter."
> Date calculated: 14/10/2029
> Notes: SCP-1032-10 has only made predictions about specific people to date. These people are difficult for the Foundation to track down, but a test was made to defy the SCP when it predicted the death of a current D-class personnel. Five minutes before the D-class was predicted to die, he was completely sealed in an airtight steel room with two guards; all three of whom had tanks of oxygen. The life sign monitoring equipment attached to the D-class showed that he was dying slowly up until the point where he died; and the guards were unable to determine the cause until it was discovered that his oxygen tank had somehow been filled with special nerve gas used to control SCPs. Further investigation is in progress.

> SCP-1032-011
> Current text: "President ████████'s term in office."
> Date calculated: ██/██/████
> Notes: ███ ████████ is currently the president of  █████████████.

> SCP-1032-012
> Current text: "███████ █████ Burger Joint"
> Date calculated: 04/07/2016
> Notes: SCP-1032-012 only predicts the end of non-corporate restaurants. A test was run to try to keep "██████'s Hotdogs" from closing; the SCP Foundation donated an anonymous $10,000 to the restaurant with the condition that he not close it. The owner renovated and renamed it "█████ ███████".

> SCP-1032-013
> Current text: "2020"
> Date calculated: 01/01/2022
> Notes: Researchers are attempting to discern if this will be the first failure of SCP-1032 or not.

**Addendum 562-1:** A disassembly of SCP-1032 was scheduled to be attempted today. However, upon noticing that the hand nearest to twelve o'clock had recently been relabeled "The day Dr. Guenther decides not to kill me." Dr. Guenther (the head of the project) decided to cancel the disassembly. A new disassembly attempt is pending O5 approval.
