**Item #:** SCP-1032

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1032 is to be kept in a secure room with one unarmed guard posted inside the room at all times.

A microscope camera must watch the front of SCP-1032 at all times. The footage from this camera is to be searched daily for any moment when any hand of the clock passes over the number twelve (12), at which point, the new measurement for that hand must be written down and its speed and arrival time calculated. (See description)

No non-digital clocks are permitted to be within 30ft of the room which SCP-1032 is contained in.

**Description:** SCP-1032 is a silver alarm clock of unknown origin and maker. It has no battery compartment nor any means of powering itself, however it continues to run regardless. The clock currently has twenty-two (22) hands of various sizes and shapes. (Note: when SCP-1032 came into the possession of the foundation, it had only 19. See addendum 1032-1)

Each hand of the clock spins at a different rate. No actual relation to common time measurement is known to exist within SCP-1032. Every hand has an inscription written in white text on its front, in text of various sizes ranging from barely legible to microscopic.

Testing has revealed that each hand of the clock measures the time until a specific event, object, person, place, or concept will end. The hand will, starting at twelve o'clock, circle around until the event written on the hand is over, be that via death, destruction, or whatever instance that SCP-1032 deems to be the conclusion. When the hand has reached twelve o'clock, the text will spontaneously change to something else, and the hand's speed will change so that it will display the end of the new event at the correct time. SCP-1032 has never been wrong to date and has predicted countless deaths, downfalls, as well as the beginning of the ███████ ███.

The date of the event that is described on each hand can be calculated by measuring the speed and distance which the hand must travel.

Each hand will be referred to as SCP-1032-01 through -1032-22, in order of size from smallest to largest.

The following is a documentation on each hand and what its current inscription is. A full log of all relevant past inscriptions can be found at [FILE ACCESS RESTRICTED]

**Addendum 562-1:** On [DATE EXPUNGED] the guard on duty for SCP-1032 noted that his wristwatch had begun "crying", and decided to leave the room, upon which the noise stopped. After some testing, we have discerned the following characteristics about SCP-1032

-Clocks within 30ft of the SCP will begin to emit a low humming noise, which will eventually grow into a muffled sobbing.

-After 5-10 minutes of crying, the clock near SCP-1032 will shriek and become silent, at which point the hands of the clock disintegrate and new hands appear on SCP-1032.

-Clocks without hands or other timekeeping devices (such as digital clocks or sun dials) are not effected by this, but clocks which have had their hands removed previously will still 'cry' when put near SCP-1032. They will not, however, lose their hands. (Or 'die', as some of our researchers call this process.)

-Clocks which have had their hands removed will cease all function, even upon deconstruction and reconstruction. 100% of the parts must be replaced in order for the clock to function again. Old parts from 'dead' clocks cause any clock they are put in to cease functionality.

It is unknown how, or why, this occurs.

**Addendum 562-2:** On [DATE EXPUNGED], slow-motion video recording of the 'killing' process of SCP-1032 revealed an unusual detail. Upon the 'death' of a clock brought into the area around the SCP, there is an approximate 0.02 second space of time near the beginning of the scream where the clock's face will contort into an actual image of a human face. This seems to confirm that SCP-1032 is physically harming other time-keeping devices near it. Restrictions have been imposed based on this.

**Addendum 562-3:** A disassembly of SCP-1032 was scheduled to be attempted today. However, upon noticing that the hand nearest to twelve o'clock had recently been relabeled "The day Dr. Guenther decides not to kill me." Dr. Guenther (the head of the project) decided to cancel the disassembly.
