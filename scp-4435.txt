**Item#:** SCP-4435

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4435 is kept inside an Incorporeal Entity Vacuum Chamber. Should SCP-4435 begin exhibiting unnatural behavior, the chamber is to be kept at a high setting to prevent SCP-4435 from dematerializing. Electronic devices are not allowed within SCP-4435's holding chamber at all times. Each camera inside the chamber has been modified with a single nPDN (Non-Physical Displacement Neutralizers) to prevent destruction from SCP-4435.

**Description:** SCP-4435 is a [[[SCP-2996|Class III Incorporeal/Corporeal Humanoid Apparition]]] and a Type 6M[[footnote]]//"Type 6M: Any spectral entity that simultaneously exists between a state of tangibility and intangibility.// For more information on Phantasmic Entities, please refer to [[[SCP-2373|Database File-2373]]] for more details.[[/footnote]] Phantasmic Entity. SCP-4435 appears as a middle-aged man of Asiatic descent wearing a black overcoat. In addition, SCP-4435 appears to have had its vocal cords surgically removed and its ligaments severed from the joints in six different places[[footnote]]Specifically, the Coracohumeral and Capsular ligaments of the shoulder, the Palmar Radiocarpal ligaments in the wrists, and the lateral collateral ligaments and the Patellar tendons near the Cruciate ligaments for the knee joints.[[/footnote]]. Because of this, SCP-4435 constantly bleeds from these extremities and observations indicate this hemorrhaging to be permanent.

While SCP-4435 is capable of existing in-between its physical and spectral form, it has shown to fully change to either one of these states; when interacting with solid obstacles, SCP-4435 will become intangible and phase through matter. Similarly, when encountering sentient entities, it will turn itself or a portion of its body tangible to interact with it. SCP-4435 is also capable of causing irreparable damage in electronic devices and equipment when passing through them[[footnote]]In some cases, the severity of the damage inflicted on the device can cause it to short-circuit and even cause corrosion both on the inside and outside.[[/footnote]].

**Discovery:** SCP-4435 was discovered by PoI-9009 ("Kevin Nguyen") after the subject had reported a "supernatural presence" in his apartment at his private blog. Foundation webcrawlers intercepted the blog post via anomalous incident recognition algorithms and mobilized MTF-Mu-13 ("Ghostbusters") to the location. Upon retrieval of SCP-4435, the entity began displaying a psychological attachment to Kevin Nguyen, who believes that SCP-4435 was his father, Brian Nguyen, who had disappeared six months prior.

**Dr. McKellis:** So how long has your father been... "haunting" your home?

**Mr. Nguyen:** Can't say for certain but I think it's been about two months. Maybe four.

**Dr. McKellis:** Why did it take you this long to put up the blog post?

**Mr. Nguyen:** I didn't think anyone would believe me.  For a long time, I was wondering if I was hallucinating or something. I didn't want to put it up because it felt stupid and ridiculous to write about my "experiences with ghosts" or some stupid shit like that.

**Dr. McKellis:** I see. Did you report anything? Did you call for anyone? Surely these disturbances took a toll on you.

**Mr. Nguyen:** They did. I didn't call anyone because I knew no one would believe me. I- I didn't feel like calling them would do much for me.

**Dr. McKellis:** How did you deal with... with these disturbances?

**Mr. Nguyen:** I uh- I started staying less and less in the apartment. I made sure to not look at mirrors or just turn them the other way because I could see him in the reflection but when I turn around to wherever he is... he isn't there anymore. It's been pretty hectic trying to avoid him. I just kept sleeping in motels or my friend's place.

**Dr. McKellis:** Did he follow you to those places?

**Mr. Nguyen:** The first few times, yeah, he did. I found- I found a way to make sure he didn't see me leaving the room. You see, he'd always come out late at night to check on me and early to noon to just... just fucking mess with me. There was a gap between those intervals. That thing could hear me so whenever I left... I'd have to walk it. I kept crashing at my buddy's so much that he offered to let me stay at his place until I can set up my apartment.

**Dr. McKellis:** You didn't tell him of what was actually happening to your apartment?

**Mr. Nguyen:** Like I said, if I did; no one would believe me. And the last thing I want is to freak out my friends that something that looks like my dead dad is walking through walls, touching their arms, or looking at them from the ceiling.

**Dr. McKellis:** I see. But why do you think this entity is your father? Aside from it looking like him, of course.

**Mr. Nguyen:** Seriously? He looks like him and- well, he just- I don't know, he just acts sort of what he did when he was still around.

**Dr. McKellis:** What was he like?

**Mr. Nguyen:** Honestly, he wasn't the best parent. Mom wasn't either, but him? God, he was just- just another level, you know? He was just so frustrating to deal with and... and I don't know if he was getting senile or this was who he really was but... he was just-
 
 //(Pause)//

**Mr. Nguyen:** What I'm trying to say is, he fucked up my life. All the way back when I was still a kid. He thought that- that maybe that this was the way parenting was supposed to go. I blamed him for the better part of my teenage years for all that I had to go through, him and mom too. He just focused on the bad shit that I did and he wouldn't let it go, yet, his inflated ego just makes him shine bright like the fucking crystal he is. A pure beacon of- of what to do and what not to do. You know, him and mom, I tried to explain to them. How I felt and it... they just wouldn't fucking understand what it felt like to live under them and be treated the way they treated me. They felt it was justified and all that bullshit and- and all I ever wanted... was a fucking apology. Just them being genuinely sorry for the amount of shit they've put me-

//(Pause)//

**Mr. Nguyen:** Oh, I'm sorry. I went- I went a little off there, didn't I? Went into a little rant there. Apologies.

**Dr. McKellis:** No, that's quite alright. I think that should be enough for today. Do you have anything else you'd like to add?

**Mr. Nguyen:** Well, I guess all I can add is that I can't be too hard on him. It was hard for him to grow up and he didn't know how to handle being a father to me.

**Dr. McKellis:** Why?

**Mr. Nguyen:** Because his dad died before he ever got the chance to know him.

Any spectral force or entity that exists within our reality has a reason to exist. Because of the way these entities operate, we have to throw logical procedures out the window. We need to establish a direct line of communication between us in the Living, and them, the Dead. Questions like "Who are you?", "What is your purpose?", and "Why are you here?" can only get you so far.

One must be careful not to upset or aggravate the already fragile condition of the entity at hand. It has already experienced enough trauma and pain in its old life so much so, that its mere manifestation and sole purpose, is to haunt the physical plane to either let others know of the agony it went through, or just to simply be left alone in its melancholic state. I don't think it needs to be explained what happens when you aggravate a ghost; I am fairly certain that [[[SCP-1337|Incident 1337-Lendall-2]]] is a lesson learned, as well as a process that we **should not** repeat again.

**Addendum 4435.3:** Second Interview and Incident
[[collapsible show="Access Addendum" hide="Hide Addendum"]]
//On April 8, 2007, during an inspection of Kevin Nguyen's apartment; MTF-Kappa-6 ("Private Eyes") discovered a journal hidden under the mattress of the apartment. Within this journal were logs describing coordinates that lead to a St. Netherstein's Hospital located in Williamstown, Kentucky. Foundation trackers within the rural city discovered that specific footage for one of the operating rooms within the hospital's surveillance system had been deleted recently. Agents were able to recover and restore the footage which showed a man resembling Kevin Nguyen doing surgery on what appears to be Brian Nguyen. Kevin Nguyen was later called in for questioning.//

**Dr. McKellis:** Mind explaining the video you just saw?

**Mr. Nguyen:** That's not me.

**Dr. McKellis:** Kevin, it would be wise to just come clean right now and tell us. We know that you tried to delete the footage. We have video evidence of you in the act. Hell, we even have the scrubs you wore in the video.

**Mr. Nguyen:** What do you want me to say? A confession?

**Dr. McKellis:** All I want to know is why you did it. Why did you kill him that way?

**Mr. Nguyen:** I- It's- I-

//(Pause)//

**Mr. Nguyen:** I couldn't take it anymore. I was- I wanted him out of my life. I killed him because I wanted him to stop it. To just stop the screaming and the hate.

**Dr. McKellis:** Why did you cut off his ligaments?

**Mr. Nguyen:** He wouldn't stop moving. I wanted to talk to him but he kept struggling around.

**Dr. McKellis:** And his vocal cords?

**Mr. Nguyen:** He kept screaming, so I cut it out.

//(Pause)//

**Dr. McKellis:** But why? Why would you do this? Why kill your own father?

**Mr. Nguyen:** I did it because I couldn't take it anymore.  //(subject begins to show signs of discomfort and increased aggression.)// He just- I- He - He just can't understand, you know? I tried to talk to him about it but I knew that he wouldn't listen to me.

**Dr. McKellis:** So you killed him? Kevin, he was your father-

**Mr. Nguyen:** Which makes it worse! I- I- You don't fucking understand what he put me through! You don't get to do that. You think I wanted to do this!?

**Dr. McKellis:** You make it sound like you didn't have a choice.

//(Pause)//

**Mr. Nguyen:** It's hard, you know? It's hard- hard trying to live up to someone's expectations. To their standard of excellence. But you try anyway. You try and you try and you try and you try again but it isn't enough. It's never going to be enough for them. You have to be something that is just- just so high up there, that you can't see the bottom anymore. You're just fucking gone. And you do it anyway... because deep down, you still love them. You love them and you want them to be proud but you can't just take the big leap. No, instead you try doing it step-by-step. You do it a little bit at a time and hope that the small progression you've made makes them happy for the meantime. But it doesn't work. It just fucking doesn't. And as soon as you reach that top, they'll hold onto the shit that you've done. The mistakes you've made before and hold that shit against you.

//(Pause)//

**Mr. Nguyen:** Sometimes, when I look at the ceiling from my bed, I can see him looking back at me. I used to be terrified of it. But I got used to it eventually. I look up and when I do see him, I just- I look at my dad's face and I know what he feels. He just feels sorry for me. I just- I knew what I did and I didn't pretend I was any happier. I regretted it. But I felt like it was enough. So in that brief moment-

**Dr. McKellis:** Kevin-

**Mr. Nguyen:** -when I was about to kill him. I just let go and gave in. I hated him. I hated everything about him and I made myself remember why I chose to do this. I wanted to scream at him for all that. Scream until it hurt.

**Dr. McKellis:** Kevin.

**Mr. Nguyen:** What?

**Dr. McKellis:** This conversation is over.
