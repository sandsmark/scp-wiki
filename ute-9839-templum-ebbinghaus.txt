[[size large]]**Description:**[[/size]]

UTE-9839 represents a non-descript object, inferred to be within a rapidly expanding zone last measured as 20km in radial area, originally situated within Călimani National Park, Romania. The area has since widened to include civilian populations, such as the evacuated town of Neagra, now a designated Zone-of-Alienation by the Romanian Government and Military Police, specified Zone-622, and is currently understood to inflict perception-alteration properties on individuals within its area.

The object at the centre of Zone-622 known as UTE-9839 is unknown in shape or dimensions, expected to be the source of the sensory-debilitating effects of Zone-622. Understanding of UTE-9839 would provide insight into the unexplained existence or purpose of Zone-622, and considerable efforts to recover UTE-9839 are currently underway.

The exact mechanics of the sensory-debilitating effects of Zone-622 are unclear, however individuals affected by these properties express similar narratives after exit from the zone. These include:

* Mild amnesia, and slight loss of subconscious memory. Affected individuals take 1-3 days to regain coherent speech.
* Some examples of unconsciousness or development of a mild comatose state.
* Poor eyesight. Partial loss of smell/taste.

Symptoms described above share resemblance to post-traumatic amnesia, often associated to be caused through severe neurological trauma. It is expected that this neurological trauma caused by exposure to Zone-622 is subconscious, occuring within a 1-2 hour period after entry, during which all sensory functions gradually decrease in condition. Effects are often mild, but cases of repeated or prolonged exposure to Zone-622 (exceeding 24 hours) have demonstrated severe capabilities:

= //Stelian Vianu was recovered from Zone-622 after exiting by foot, suggested to be the last remaining sensitised resident of Neagra. Operator [040-50█-2███] was found to have been exposed to the effects of Zone-622, and sustained minor yet permanent hearing loss from the duration of the call. Incident may prove UTE-9839 emits a resonance capable of inducing these effects, which was capable of transmitting across the landline.//
[[/div]]

The subconscious neurological trauma experienced within Zone-622 will result in the entire 'desensitisation' of individuals following 5-6 hours of exposure, in which subjects will lose all sensory function; including sight, hearing, smell, taste, balance and pain. This process is irreversible after exit from Zone-622, despite individuals having suffered no physical damage to sensory organs. Individuals who have become desensitised are incapable of the most basic influence or understanding of their environment, and are without assistance observed to expire within 24 hours from accidental injury.

It is suggested that Zone-622 inflicts these properties on subjects through application of specific stimuli on the senses in order to incapacitate them. The most accepted hypothesis implies that Zone-622 is capable of emitting a resonance which induces these effects, with the use of sound-waves to disrupt or entirely block certain neurological processes while within the zone. It is expected that UTE-9839 may be the source.

= **ANALYSIS OF WAVELENGTHS EMITTED FROM THE EPICENTRE OF ZONE-622.**

Quiet infrasonic resonances have been recorded to be emitted from Zone-622 continuously. These sounds remain at a consistent frequency of 18.97 Hz to a degree of accuracy seemingly unaffected by environmental factors (wind, pressure, echo.) Measurements taken from the forest and Neagra give the exact same reading, regardless of conditions.

18.97 Hz is noted to be remarkably close to sound waves emitted by the eyes and facial muscles. Frequencies of 18.98Hz are already known to cause vision disorientation due to vibrating of the eyes, however the resonance emitted by Zone-622 is incapable of cause any physical damage to sensory organs.

Tracing of the sound leads to the epicentre of Zone-622, suggesting that the alleged object UTE-9839 situated at the centre of Zone-622 is the source. Investigation pending.

[[/div]]

The exact purpose of this perception-alteration influence is unknown. As the zone expands, it is noted that the time until total desensitisation delays. Measurements have concluded that the relationship between these two factors maintain so that time until total desensitisation is equal to the time it takes to reach the centre of Zone-622. Early hypothesis suggests that the perception-alteration influence has two theorised purposes: to prevent human interaction with or understanding of an object (UTE-9839) within the epicentre of Zone-622, or remove human influence from the area.

[[size large]] **Rules of Engagement:** [[/size]]

UTE-9839 is interminable due to our lack of whereabouts or understanding of the object. If the exact nature of UTE-9839 is determined, further means of liquidation may be approved. Research efforts are currently underway; --the proposal of co-operation with the SCP Foundation is currently pending review--.

[[size large]] **History** [[/size]]

Zone-622 was originally discovered by Romanian Police in 2012, but began rapid expansion in early 2017. On March 4th, Zone-622 expanded unknowingly into the rural town of Neagra. Reaction from the authorities was slow and hindered, despite previous knowledge of the existence of Zone-622 for many years in the nearby wildlife reserves (notably Călimani National Park), existing in folklore but mostly nameless in the public domain.

+++++ **RECIPIENT: INSPECTOR GENERAL**
+++++ **REPORT CONCERNING THE SITUATION WITHIN NEAGRA. (7/3/18)**

Neagra has been isolated for 3 days. Many of the residents who have not exited through coincidence are now unknowingly dying from dehydration. They cannot communicate with us. Rises in the local bear population are suggested to be due to the abundance of a human food source. The birds are eating them as they stand.

The Foundation is nonetheless closer to finding it's so-called 'blackbox' which they claim will supply the answer to all of this. Meanwhile evacuation is occurring but not at a sufficient speed. We do not have a large enough workforce to undertake this operation. I am requesting more assistance for the evacuation process. We lost several teams who entered the town of Neagra before we were made aware of its indescribable effects. We current understand that while within the zone we are operating within a narrow timespace, suggested by the GOC to last 2 hours before all primary senses are lost. This means each man can withstand 2 hours within Neagra before we need a replacement. Volunteers are hardly abundant. Please, send more personnel. The people in there are being eaten as we speak.

[[/div]]

Evacuation of Neagra was ceased on 9/12/18 (5 days after the alienation of Neagra) after reports confirmed that 70% of residents were deceased. The highest cause of death was due to mauling, presumably from bears or other animals from the local area.

//pt.1 police transcript, guy finds a bunch of dead mauled bodies, town & forest full of unresponsive people, stays within the zone too long, sees the gavel for like a second, stops talking, radio continues for 5 more hours silent.//

Following failed attempts to enter Zone-622 and locate UTE-9839 by joint effort of the Foundation and GOC, CI intervention was inevitable. Due to the involvement of multiple dangerous factions, attempted neutralisation of UTE-9839 was performed.

Explosive device also failed to detonate, and appeared to land in a river inside the zone and was carried downstream. The device was recovered and examined. It appears the timer on the detonator had been reset immediately upon entry of Zone-622, causing the device to detonate approximately 30 minutes after exit from Zone-622 [REMOVED]. Conclusions suggest Zone-622 may be a protective barrier against human intervention.||

Reasons unexplained. The device was disassembled and returned safely to storage. It is concluded that UTE-9839 cannot be influenced through external devices. Current understanding of UTE-9839 prevents us from taking appropriate action. Recommend contacting external sources for assistance on this matter.||
[[/div]]

The Foundation was unsupportive of both nuclear tests, indicating that removal of UTE-9839 may hinder further access to Zone-622. Events have recently escalated, and the Foundation has temporarily discontinued cooperation with the GOC. It is expected that due the breaking of this alliance the CI may attempt to intervene with the Romanian Government. The GOC is currently pending review whether they should take responsibility over UTE-9839, or abandon the project.
