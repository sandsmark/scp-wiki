title:Dr. Leicontis's Personnel File
**Name:** Dr. Philip Leighton
**Primary Alias(es):** "Leicontis"; "Dr. Leicontis"
**Clearance Level:** 2
**Primary Role:** Materials analysis, characterization, and replication

**Personnel History:** Doctor Leighton first came to the Foundation's attention when Japanese authorities reported that someone was making inquiries regarding the parent grove of [[[SCP-143]]].  When questioned, he revealed that he had obtained an antique manuscript which referenced the so-called "Bladewood Grove", and due to his near-obsessive interest in swordmaking, immediately began further research in hopes of uncovering the truth behind the stories.   His persistence impressed Agent ███████ who suggested that Dr. Leighton be recruited by the Foundation.  From the interview transcript:

> **Agent ███████:** "Okay, okay!  I'll ask them!  Now let go of my leg, and stop it with the puppy-dog eyes - it's not cute, it's ████ing creepy!"

While Dr. Leicontis has proven himself a capable researcher, and shown a surprising degree of comfort with even dangerous SCPs, his interpersonal skills could still stand some improvement.  He often tends to regard his fellow researchers as a greater threat than the anomalous objects they research, and seems to swing between timid-and-deferential and abrasive-and-hostile.  Fortunately, due to his utter ineptness at physically demanding tasks, including combat, he does not pose any actual threat to other staff.

**Note:** In light of recent incidents, Dr. Leicontis is not permitted direct access to --blade-related SCPs-- --any sharp objects-- blade-related SCPs.

**Note:** For his own safety, Dr. Leicontis should not be allowed to communicate directly with Agent Yoric without supervision.
