Ah yes.  Yes, I think I am the one you've come to see.  I've been expecting you, to be honest.  Oh, please.  Don't sit there.  I'll come along quietly, but you must...  Well, anyway, please don't make any fuss, if you have to sit there.  I don't deal well with stress.

Yes, I do have a tattoo, and yes, I do mind showing it to you.  It's somewhere rather private.  I'd be terribly embarrassed to have to show it here, in public, and embarrassment makes me...  Oh, let's just forget about it for now.  You can see it later.

To be honest, it's rather a relief.  I've been wandering around for a week now, wondering just who would find me.  We hear stories, you know, of you, and the GOC, and what's that club?  Marshall's something?  Anyway, I don't think those groups would do me any good.

Where will we be going, anyway?  I understand if you don't want to tell me in particulars, but I would like some idea.  I don't like surprises.  I can't enjoy them at all anymore.  

Excuse me, but could you put out that cigarette?  No, I don't have asthma, but I really feel it would be best if...  Well, it's your health.  I do wish you'd be more careful with it, though.

Ah, yes.  I'm not entirely sure how I left the facility.  I woke up in an alley.  It may have been deliberate release, or a kidnapping.  Or it might have been...  Well, if they were transporting me, and weren't careful...  These things happen, you know.

Mr. Redd won't be there, will he?  I...  I don't think I'd enjoy meeting Mr. Redd, if he's there.  Wouldn't do anyone any good, I daresay.

Do you have some water?  Only, I find myself somewhat thirsty, and...  Well, I'm sorry.  I'm feeling a little warm.  Perhaps it would be good if you'd sit back?  I don't think you should be sitting right there.  And your cigarette isn't helping matters.  Look, I'm not trying to be difficult but...

Oh dear.  I've done it again.  And he was such a nice young man.  

Oh, hello.  Were you a friend of his?  Ah.  Yes.  I see.  Well, I tried to warn him.

My name?  It's Mr. Combustible.  I'm pleased to meet you.  Pardon if I don't shake your hand.
