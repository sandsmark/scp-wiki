**Item #:** SCP-X

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-X is to be held at Armed Research Site-45 for weaponization and testing purposes. Access to SCP-X is to be limited to Level 2 clearance, with provisions made to military personnel of appropriate rank. Use of SCP-X is to be properly supervised by no less than two (2) researchers with all results documented and archived for experimental review.

**Description:** SCP-X appears to be a pair of archaic Grecian sandals, dated to 720 BC. The sandals themselves are crafted entirely from pure 24 kt gold, although lacking the typical weight and malleability. Of note is the fact that, despite being such an ancient artifact, SCP-X shows no wear or degradation. On either side of the heel of both sandals are two small avian-like wings. DNA analysis shows that the wings, while biological, match no known species of bird.
