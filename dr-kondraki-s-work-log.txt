**Item #:** SCP-382

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Is to be contained at it’s current location in ██████, Iceland. No attempts to move or relocate SCP-382 are to be made, and thus both the object, and the surrounding area require continuous surveillance and observation by a contingent of no less than twenty (20) level 2 security personnel. Any attempts to breach containment by the nearby civilian population are to be first  met with reprimand, and then termination, to be covered up at a later time. For testing purposes, SCP-382 is to be turned .5 mm once per day, to be reset at the beginning of every month. If an attempt is made to turn SCP-382 to its fullest, all Class D personnel involved in testing are to be terminated immediately.

**Description:** SCP-382 appears to be a standard model valve, for use with a garden hose. The device itself is of no remarkable design, and is perfectly capable of being damaged or worn. The valve itself is painted white, with considerable wear on the finish. The valve’s apparatus is directly connected to the outside of the house it is affixed to,  although investigation shows no actual plumbing system in place to deliver water to the valve. Turning the valve will cause no actual water to run, but will produce a sound similar to that of a valve discharging a liquid, along with a faint hissing noise.
