**Item #:** SCP-X

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-X is to be maintained in a standard personnel-grade room furbished to its liking, with all additions and changes requiring Level 4 approval before application. The containment area must be airtight, and all seals are to be checked and maintained on a regular basis. Various other privileges are to be allowed on a case-by-case basis, to be given or revoked based on appropriate behavior. An educator with Level 2 clearance and a background in psychology is to tutor SCP-X from a remote location.

**Description:** SCP-X appears to be a Caucasian female, 15 years of age, typically clothed in several layers of thick clothing, covered in a winter parka. Subject requires biological needs typical of normal humans, and ages at a normal rate. The sole exception is SCP-X’s lack of reliance on respiration, instead absorbing oxygen through its skin-like epidermal membrane. Otherwise, SCP-X requires standard care given to human-like objects. SCP-X’s temperament varies from time to time, which has been recognized as acute bipolar disorder. Due to the difficulty of administering medical treatment, personnel are to be wary of interactions with SCP-X, regardless of its current disposition.

Rather than skin, SCP-X possesses a highly reactive chemical membrane that, when inactive, is for all intents and purposes normal human skin. When activated, either fully or partially, all atmospheric gases in direct contact with the membrane instantaneously solidify into a superdense state. The appearance of this material varies based upon the local atmospheric composition, thus it is normally categorized by the translucence of solid nitrogen.
