**Item #:** SCP-375

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-375 is to be kept under full surveillance by a security detail of no less than twelve (12) level 2 personnel disguised as bank employees and security guards. All personnel involved with SCP-375 are to wear [[[SCP-148]]] “Telekill” alloy headpieces at all times, except for specific experimental purposes. While not inherently dangerous, all precautions are to be taken to avoid public discovery of SCP-375’s properties, or in the rare occasion, to protect SCP-375’s yield during an attempted robbery. In the event of an attempted robbery, personnel are to follow procedure outlined in Protocol Document 375-i2.
