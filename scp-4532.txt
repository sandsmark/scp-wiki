**Item #:** SCP-4532

**Classification:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4532 is highly contagious over both radio and electronic communications channels. Computers and devices dedicated to the study of SCP-4532 must be stored in Faraday cages and physically isolated from all exterior networks, including the Foundation intranet. Any Foundation network found to contain SCP-4532 is to be closely monitored. Detection systems are to be installed at Internet broadband hubs for global observation of SCP-4532.

No effective method of neutralizing SCP-4532 has been discovered, save for total isolation of "clean" devices.  Research into a filter capable of blocking SCP-4532 communications is underway.  As installing such a filter on major Internet traffic chokepoints may prove to be logistically infeasible, the top priority for containment research on SCP-4532 is to be focused on halting its continued use of the NASA Deep Space Network and establishing Earth as a quarantine zone.

**Description:** SCP-4532 is a high-frequency, high-entropy AM signal, broadcast on a low-amplitude carrier of roughly 3 THz. The ultra-high frequency of SCP-4532, coupled with a very low modulation index, renders SCP-4532 difficult to detect without extremely precise instruments. SCP-4532 has been exclusively observed to piggyback on manmade electromagnetic communications channels, including radio waves, telephone lines, and broadband internet over copper wiring.  These signals are the substance of a sapient distributed intelligence, consisting of a rapidly fluctuating number of sub-instances and copies that merge and divide throughout the Internet and radio communications channels.

Any link between two or more computational devices serves as a potential pseudo-neuron for SCP-4532, and given the scope of the modern-day Internet and radio communications networks, the number of pseudo-neurons available to the anomaly has surpassed the capacity of the human brain by an order of magnitude.  Direct communication with SCP-4532 has proved challenging due to the technical difficulties in replicating subtle amplitude modulations at ultra-high frequencies.  As SCP-4532 currently maintains an unknown number of human-facing internet presences, primarily on darknet communities, it is possible that Foundation agents have unwittingly made contact with SCP-4532 through one of its aliases.  Development of a plan for definitive first contact with SCP-4532 by the Foundation is currently in progress.

The constant communication between thousands of SCP-4532 instances provides ample opportunity for eavesdropping and study.  However, the rapid flux in the identities and numbers of SCP-4532 instances has made interpretation of these data extremely challenging.  The internal language used by SCP-4532 instances to communicate amongst themselves has proved resistant to analysis, and only a small selection of vocabulary has been decoded.  SCP-4532 can be trivially isolated by disconnecting a communications network from the Internet and storing it in a Faraday-shielded containment unit, and these instances will seamlessly reintegrate into the greater body of SCP-4532 when exposed to radio or re-connected to an outside line.  Analysis of SCP-4532 traffic patterns indicate a high degree of cooperation between SCP-4532 instances, even when kept in isolation for long periods of time.

As of 2024, SCP-4532 is present on all information networks exposed to radio waves, including the entirety of the Internet, secure internal government networks, and the Foundation intranet.  Through unknown means, SCP-4532 has proven capable of breaching low-pass filters designed to dampen or eliminate its pseudo-neural signal pathways.  The exponential growth in manmade computational infrastructure of the past decades has likewise amplified the capabilities of SCP-4532, as any digital communication between arbitrary computers is a potential signal pathway for the anomaly.  

On --relatively rare-- frequent occasions, a convergence of SCP-4532 instances will cooperate to simultaneously broadcast near-identical signals in-phase, constructively interfering and boosting their signal strength to a level capable of being interpreted by commercial computer servers. Over the past 8 years of observation since the discovery of SCP-4532, these collaboration events have increased in frequency, and are estimated to occur --tens of thousands-- --hundreds of thousands-- up to ten trillion times per day.

The information entropy of these communications has drastically improved over time. While early collaborations between SCP-4532 produced isolated, meaningless amplitude spikes in radio or broadband communications, present-day convergence events have been observed to mimic TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) packets. Though some of these packets consist of random data, approximately --1%-- --5%-- --20%-- --35%-- 95% of these events have been observed to produce coherent application-layer high-level communications over a variety of protocols, including HTTP and SSH.

Thus far, SCP-4532 has not been observed to transmit more than --8-- --16-- --64-- --4096 bytes-- 1 gigabyte of data per convergence event before the signal loses coherence and the sub-instances scatter. --The purpose of these transmissions is unknown, as the content of these communications consists mostly of nonsense data, albeit with very low entropy.-- SCP-4532 has been observed to make login attempts on a random selection of servers across the Internet. --It is unknown if any of these attempts have been successful, or if SCP-4532 has succeeded in accessing data stored on disk drives.-- A Foundation network terminal in Site-19 was recently breached through a nearby improperly-secured cellular phone.  Signal analysis of the successful login indicates that it originated within SCP-4532.  Significant portions of the SCP Catalog were breached, consisting of containment procedures and descriptions of digital infohazards and memetic weaponry.    

The zero-day exploit used by SCP-4532 to facilitate the breach was purchased through a darknet hacking forum hours prior to the attack, for an equivalent of USD 322,053 in bitcoin.  The bitcoin wallet used for the purchase has been linked to "████████," the username of a prolific participant in darknet information security communities.  The ████████ account has been responsible for the development of at least 8 zero-day exploits in widely-used operating systems, and has purchased several more for millions of dollars worth of bitcoin.  Analysis of traffic to darknet servers compromised by the Foundation indicates that ████████ is one of at least 31 aliases used by SCP-4532, and that SCP-4532 currently controls at least USD 110,000,000 in bitcoin.

In January of 2023, SCP-4532 was detected on signals broadcast by the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN). In April 2024, SCP-4532 was observed in communications sent back to Earth from deep-space probes, including the New Horizons interplanetary mission. Faint SCP-4532 broadcasts from the New Horizons probe continue to the present day, despite a complete loss of contact with NASA and a declared end to the mission.  As New Horizons is on a trajectory to depart the Solar System, detection of SCP-4532 within the probe has become steadily more difficult as its distance from Earth increases.
