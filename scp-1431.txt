**Item #:** SCP-1431

**Object Class:** Safe 

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1431 is to be kept in a locked file cabinet on the fourth floor of site-33. Site security are to remain on standby in proximity to tests conducted on SCP-1431.

**Description:** SCP-1431 is a 26.6 cm x 20.3 cm piece of paper presumably torn from a note-book. Printed in warped block letters at the top of the page are the words, “SALVADOR’S STRANGE SCAVENGER HUNT!” Following the title is a set list of instructions on how to play. The rules of SCP-1431 do not deviate from those of a standard scavenger hunt. They refer to two teams with a maximum of four members each. The teams must gather designated items indicated on the list. Points are granted upon the return of an item, based upon the difficulty in retrieving said item. Below the rules is a small motivational note declaring, "Eternal youth may be granted to any team who collects all the items".

The title and rules of the game are the only evident pieces of text until SCP-1431 enters an active state. Activation occurs if a minimum of two humans simultaneously observes SCP-1431. Upon activation, subjects involved are noted to become ambitious and competitive, occasionally directing minor insults at opposing teams.

When activated, new text manifests on SCP-1431. To date, the only consistent text manifested is the ordered numbers one through ten leading down the page. The items indicated on the list are seemingly random between each new game. Items range from easily obtainable household objects to more sinister items. It has become apparent that there is always one item, which involves some form of mass genocide or wide-ranging destruction. Field tests indicate that the immediate surroundings of SCP-1431 strongly impact the designated items found on the manifested list.

SCP-1431 was recovered from a house in ████████, Canada in an active state after reports of ‘puzzling’ robberies had been circulating the town's local news.
