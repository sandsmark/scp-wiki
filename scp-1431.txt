**Item #:** SCP-1431

**Object Class:** Safe 

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1431 is to be kept in a securely locked filing cabinet on the fourth floor of site-██. Site security is to remain on standby in proximity to tests conducted on SCP-1431. 

**Description:** SCP-1431 is a 26.6 cm x 20.3 cm sheet of paper presumably torn from a note-book. Printed in warped block letters at the top of the page are the words, “SALVADOR’S STRANGE SCAVENGER HUNT!” Following the title is a set list of instructions on how to play. The rules of SCP-1431 do not deviate from those of a standard scavenger hunt. They refer to two teams with no maximum amount of players. The teams must gather designated items indicated on a list. Points are granted upon the return of an item based upon the difficulty in retrieving said item. Below the rules is a small motivational note declaring, "Failure to attempt to gather items is poor sportsmanship and will result in feelings of despair, followed by death. Better get cracking!” 

The title and rules of the game are the only evident pieces of text until SCP-1431 enters an active state. Activation occurs if a minimum of two humans simultaneously observe SCP-1431. 

When activated, new text manifests on SCP-1431. To date, the only consistent text manifested is the ordered numbers one through ten leading down the page. The items indicated on the list are random. However, a certain uniform theme in the designated items is distinctly present between each test.  Field tests indicate that there is always at least one designated 'normal' item on the list.

SCP-1431 was recovered from a house in ████████, Canada in an active state after reports of ‘puzzling’ robberies had been circulating the town's local news.
