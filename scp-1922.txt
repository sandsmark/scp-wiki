**Item#** SCP-1922

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1922 is housed in a standard human containment cell on Site-17. The subject is to remain under monitoring by security personnel. Self-harmful behavior or changes in the subject's health are to be reported to doctors Dharow and/or Ipps-Hill. Psychiatric evaluations with interviews are administered by Dr. Dharow and health inspections by Dr. Ipps-Hill. Said procedures are performed on a monthly basis; and after the occurrence of anomalous activity. SCP-1922 is not allowed to possess items of combustible nature and is to be supervised to prevent contact with such when outside the cell.

**Description:** SCP-1922 is a ninety-year-old Caucasian male named Herbert ████. SCP-1922 is diagnosed with Diabetes mellitus type 2 and peripheral vascular disease. Subject's medical condition with the effect of the anomaly have caused several episodes of gangrene in the lower limbs, which have led to amputations. For a full list of medical details on SCP-1922, please see Document 1922-Med.

SCP-1922 behaves as a normal elderly human until expiring from a natural cause, myocardial infarction being the most common probable cause of death. SCP-1922 remains in a state of clinical death for approximately 45 minutes, after which it slowly reanimates. Full recovery may take up to 2 hours. After reanimation the subject is slightly disoriented, but the periods of clinical death have not been shown to cause any neurological damage.  IQ testing has proven no deterioration and SCP-1922 appears mentally healthy and intelligent. Compared to subject's advanced age, the level of intellect is well maintained.  The subject describes experiences in elaborate detail, supposedly taking place during the anomalous activity. Currently no evidence exist nor may be provided to support the subject's claims. Whether the anomaly induces vivid hallucinations or SCP-1922 deliberately produces misinformation is unknown. For more details, please see Document 1922-Psy and the Interview Log.

//Note: 2005-07-03: It has been recorded that the time SCP-1922 remains clinically deceased extends after each subsequent expiry. The reanimation process, nevertheless, takes subsequently less time.//

//Note: 2008-05-05: SCP-1922 has started to show suicidal tendencies.//

**Recovery:** SCP-1922 was recovered from █████ Hospital in █████, ███████ on 1997-06-06. Specialized doctors were alerted when a man had regained consciousness in the hospital morgue, almost an hour after having been declared deceased. The subject was taken into custody of the Foundation and the subject's family was later provided with substitute ashes. Class-C Amnesiacs administered to hospital staff in charge of the subject. SCP-1922 was led to believe being moved to different hospital with better faculties.

It's happened before. At home. But I was all by myself, then. First I thought I had slept. But it wasn't all right, you know. I guess you caught me this time, didn't you? **[Subject laughs]** An old man, cheating death.

**Addendum 1922-3: Psychological Evaluation:**

[[collapsible show="Document 1922-Psy" hide="Close document"]]


> **[Excerpt]** 
> 
> Even after years of interrogations [discontinued 1998-02-08] and ongoing interviews, SCP-1922 is reluctant to provide information on the means of acquired prolonged lifespan. SCP-1922 is considered to be in complete awareness of the process behind the reanimation, but refuses to cooperate. No crucial information has been obtained from the subject, and as medical examinations and testing have proved inconclusive, the means to the subjects ability to reanimate remain currently unknown. SCP-1922 has become increasingly suicidal and even less compliant, making the monthly interviews unavailing.
> 
> As medical examinations show [refer to Document 1922-Med], SCP-1922 in the state of clinical death shows no brain activity. However, after reanimation the subject has been able to describe experiences that have supposedly occurred during the period. It has not been determined if the subject is actually capable of such experiences or if the descriptions of such are merely intended to mislead the researchers. SCP-1922 claims that during death, it (or its consciousness) is transferred to an undisclosed locus. According to the subject this locus is occupied by what appear to be parts of the human body, mainly hair and limbs. SCP-1922 has also occasionally described skin, organs and teeth. The subject reports feelings of dread and nausea, and often refuses to discuss these visions. This behavior led to the dismissed theory that SCP-1922 is able to dream while being clinically deceased. The absence of any brain activity indicates otherwise. SCP-1922 believes its own body to be responsible for the transfer and the only way to "escape" this condition to be cremation. Subject's concerns are to be disregarded.
