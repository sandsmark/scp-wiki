**Description:** SCP-134 was found in an orphanage in ███████████, ██████████ on █████████ ██, ████. She had been there for some time and was never adopted because people were terrified of her.

SCP-134 is a hybrid. She is half-human and half-grey. It is not known whether she was created by abduction or by one of the sister sites, but she has told us that she cannot remember anything before her time in the orphanage. Her eyes are light blue and her skin is smooth, hairless and pink-grey. Her anatomy is almost exactly like most humans except she has three fingers on each hand, lacks nipples and has white blood. She is healthy, but frail and excessively shy.

Examinations have shown that she is capable of using various grey abilities including telepathy, healing, empathy and mild psychokinesis. She has taken a job as Dr. Rose's assistant in the infirmary and her health is kept under close observation.
