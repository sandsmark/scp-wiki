**Name:**  Vladim A. Eisenberg к.т.н.

**Security Clearance:** --Level 2-- Temporarily revoked.

**Education:** Specialist Diploma, Charkov Polytechnic, Candidate of Technical Sciences (к.т.н), Vladivostok Polytechnic, Absolvent of Evening University of Marxism-Leninism.
 
**Specialisation:**  Material Science, SCP Research, Containment procedures.

**Site of Operations:** Site 19. Formerly Site-35.

**Profile:** Researcher Eisenberg is currently isolated in Section-5 Medical Wing of Site-19 subject to treatment for [REDACTED] (see Document-19-SG-VAE-1 for assessment records and Document-19-SG-VAE-2 for prescribed therapy and medication) resulting from SCP-022-J exposure.
During his indisposition, the coordination of any projects under his lead is passed on to the co-ordinator of the Anomalous Structural Materials Research Group. The status of the documentation maintained by Researcher Eisenberg is unclear. Personnel of appropriate clearance willing to re-view and corroborate the content of such files can find them listed below.

**History:** Born in Mukacevo, Ukrainian SSR. Two siblings - Older David agricultural engineer, currently unemployed, while younger Leonid arrested in 199█ for claiming tax returns from fictitious trades. Studied materials science on Charkov Polytechnic.

Joined the Foundation in 1998 as a fresh graduate after being involved in joint research between the Foundation and the Ukrainian government relating to an outbreak of SCP-836. Done his post-gradual studies while working for the Foundation as one of the researchers overseeing production on Site-35.

 After the [REDACTED] attack on Site-35, and resulting containment breach Researcher Eisenberg was one of the ██ survivors, found four days later in a janitor's closet in the administrative building, dehydrated, delirious, and hugging a stuffed lynx claiming it to be "Uncle Fedor from Volgograd".

 He has since made a full recovery, and been assigned to Site-19, where he was responsible for indexing and coordinating research for objects discovered within Central and Eastern Europe, in addition to working as a part of the Anomalous Structural Materials Research Group.

On ██/07/201█, presumably as an administrative oversight, Researcher Eisenberg was assigned to work on documentation pertaining to SCP-022-J, despite his personnel records indicating him to be of short temper and likely suffering from SCP-022-J-2. Approximately half-way through the task, Researcher Eisenberg entered a rage state, which culminated in him assaulting a security guard with a keyboard. (see Incident-022-J-1 for details). As a result, Researcher Eisenberg was submitted for psychiatric examination, and based on its findings, temporarily relieved from duty.

**Notable Possessions:** --Researcher Eisenberg's office contains "Nastasia", an instance of SCP-692-1 - an ambulatory 0.5m x 0.3m sheet of linen cloth enclosing the shape of a house cat.-- On ██/08/201█, after numerous requests, SCP-692-1 "Nastasia" has been moved to his current dwelling, after being confirmed as safe for handling. Researcher Eisenberg appears to be progressing towards recovery at a significantly faster rate since.
