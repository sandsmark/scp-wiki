+++ The Story So Far...

> //,,This section is for those just coming in and need to catch up.  Basically the TL;DR version of everything up to current.,,//

The Cult of New Umbra, having beef with the Serpent's Hand and the Library, decides to free the Second Child ([[[SCP-017]]]) from the SCP.  Using the Book of Shadows from the Library and an antimemetic familiar (later named Ben), they send a lone homonculus agent, Umber, to Site-81.  Umber and Ben are able to infiltrate the site using magic.  Along the way they meet with Emily ([[[SCP-2996]]]) and she joins the mission.  They all make it to the lower level where Umber is shot and killed, but his body is taken by Emily off-site to a cave.  There, Umber is reincarnated and they successfully infiltrate Site-81 again.  They are able to create a containment breach by cutting off the main power so they can reach the chamber where the Second Child is.  After getting back to the lower level, they are intercepted by Special Task Force Zeta-5.  There is a fight ending with Emily being contained and taken back into the depths of the facility, leaving only Umber and Ben.

++++ Umber

[[div style="float:right; padding: 5px;"]]
[[image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work/umber_1.png width="75px"]]
[[/div]]

Umber is a homunculus made of shadowstuff and wool.  He was constructed by the artificer supreme at the request of Kiran, the leader of the Cult of New Umbra.  Umber had been sent to the library a handful of times acquiring texts on behalf of his masters, sometimes with or without the knowledge of the librarians.  His previous mission was to obtain the book of shadows, a tome of forbidden spells and knowledge that the cult desperately wanted but was kept from them by the library's archivists.  Now he has been sent to Site-81 with the book to release the Second Child, a keter entity under lock and key by the SCP Foundation.  He is focused, impatient, ill-tempered, and genuinely ignorant of the human world.

++++ Ben

[[div style="float:right; padding: 5px;"]]
[[image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work/bell.png width="50px"]]
[[/div]]

Ben is a small sentient construct made of a special metal called shadowsteel.  It was forged by the artificer supreme specifically for Umber's mission to Site-81.  It also has the special ablity to emit a sound that has antimemetic effects in humans who can hear its ring.  Ben can often be seen floating about head-height around Umber unless ordered elsewhere.  Ben must obey his master, Umber, or risk undoing the shadowmancy which holds him in this world.  Ben does show signs of relative intelligence, but unfortunately has little at hand in order to express itself when it needs to.

++++ Emily Nash

[[div style="float:right; padding: 5px;"]]
[[image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work/Emily.png width="50px"]]
[[/div]]

An incorporeal entity that was initially discovered in an abandoned home in Nashville, Indiana and assigned as [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2996 SCP-2996] by the Foundation.  She usually appears as a young female with a number of visible wounds across her body, including a major gunshot wound to the right eye.  She also claims the identity of one Emily Nash, the subject of a murder in Nashville, Indiana, in 1929. Data recovered from various sources have supported the claim that an Emily Nash was found dead in her home; however, the listed cause of death was suicide. Based on Foundation interviews, she has rejected any evidence that supports suicide, and has vehemently remarked on several occasions that her killer was a close friend and neighbor though their existence has not been verified.  Much of her background is inconsistent, incomplete, or unreliable according to Foundation records.  The mentions of a Samantha Pendleton in her record are of an unknown origin.

++++ Virgil

[[div style="float:right; padding: 5px;"]]
[[image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work/Virgil.png]]
[[/div]]

Virgil is an AIC in the late stages of alpha-testing before being released fully.  Currently assigned to menial IT helpdesk tasks, Virgil works on resetting passwords, diagnosing hardware, and other low-priority daily tasks.  Virgil has gotten some feedback about adjusting the way the personality drive interacts with the task master process flow and the adaptive interface output.  Virgil's build has a limited release running on only a few test sites, one of which being Site-81.


++++ Sage

[[div style="float:right; padding: 5px;"]]
[[image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work-dos/sage.png width="75px"]]
[[/div]]

A lazy toad that you'd think was dead if it didn't periodically croak from time to time.  Seems to only croak when danger is close by.  Otherwise, Sage is just a slimy green lump with eyes.
