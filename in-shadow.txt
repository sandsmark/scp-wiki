+ CHAPTER I  
+++ The Second Child Cometh

[[collapsible show="► The Forging [COMPLETE]" hide="▼ Close" hideLocation="both"]]

On a desk, the artificer supreme of the Umbra Cult sat and pondered about her given task.  "The [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/the-second-child second child] cometh?  Now of all times.  In //my// lifetime even."  She sighed as she prepared the forging ritual.  "Time to get started."

This was not a time to falter in her craft, it was a time for her to masterfully build what was asked.  A familiar of great worth and use would be needed to help the mission.  In her hands, she shuffled the major card decks of artifice, each card drawing synergies from the other cards or decks in order to infuse and create a new form made of malleable shadowsteel, an ingot of which she had gently placed on the desk in the center of a carved heptagram.  She began crafting her recipe with the decks, making sure they were thoughfully turned in sequence in order to create the correct combination of a sustainable balance of both form, shadow, and power. 

She drew from the middle, the inverted cauldron to start, followed by the sparking hammer from the minor deck of shades.  Several draws from the deck of whispers to give the familiar purpose of mind.  Two cards were drawn and burned to ash as sacrificial offernings.  Cards were continually drawn and exchanged, each combination more tempered in elegance than the last until finally a perfect method presented itself.  All chosen cards were slowly placed in the proper sequencing along the heptagram.  The ingot of shadowsteel in the center began to glow with a dark purple as the recipe completed itself with the guidance and experience of the white-haired artificer.

Her old hands finally turned over the last three cards left outside the heptagram, **one to be selected and placed as the key focus component**. 

A broken chakram,

a bent chalice,

and a spent candle holder.

After a brief pause in thought, the answer became clear...

 [[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work/c_1.png width="500px"]] 

“…of course, **the candle holder.**”  The artificer slid the card toward her to observe it better.  “To dim the minds of those who would observe our agents.”

[[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work/c_1_1.png width="500px"]]

With a flick of her fingers, she tossed the card into the heptagram.  There was a tell-tale sign of a temperature drop as the ingot became lit with a bright pink fire.  The heptagram closed and light in the room dimmed all around.  With outstretched legs, the tired artificer pushed her chair back and reached for her pipe as she waited for her recipe to “cook” itself.  The peal of ringing metal resonated against the walls as the ingot took on a conic shape.  Dark runes began to etch themselves along the outsides of the brazen steel as the object took on its intended appearance.  A bell.

[[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work/bell_ritual.png width="200px"]]

A floating bell began to emerge from the bright fire and dancing cards.  As the artificer inhaled the first drag from her pipe, the heptagram collapsed with a sudden burst of vacuum followed by the scent of ozone.  The familiar was built.  “Ah, welcome little one.”  She smiled at it and nodded.  For sure a work that her long dead mentor could be proud of as well.

[[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work/bell.png width="100px"]]

The bell floated stoically.  Not yet even aware of its master or even its own existence just yet.  Another drag and puff from the artificer as she glanced over at the clock on her wall.  

“Oh damn!  The time!”  

Quickly she winced as she got up on her arthritic knees, summoned a portal in her workshop, and tossed her hapless creation into it.  The familiar made an audible “Plorp!” as it passed through a membrane of shadowstuff.

[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show="► The Council of 3 Shades [COMPLETE]" hide="▼ Close" hideLocation="both"]]


Meanwhile, in a pocket dimension of darkness, the council of three shades stood at an altar and discussed the recent events.  Their shadows outstretched from their respective locations so they could, by proxy, talk privately in person.

[[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work/council_3.png width="500px"]]

“It actually retrieved it?  Straight off the shelves of the library?”

“Aye, from the vault even… so we are going through with the plan, right?”

The Umbra Cult leader, Kiran Singh, tapped the altar with their shadow to interrupt his two subordinates.  “Yes.  Now if you two would just let me finish.  We carry this through… and we do it with the homunculus.”

“The homunculus!?  Wouldn’t you rather put your trust in… you know… an //actual// member to accomplish this?”

The adjacent shadow grew irritated and spoke sternly, “You really want to send a member?  When we are already on the sore side of the library?  When they have every single one of our members’ names on their black list?  We can’t even get a bloody library card!  Can you imagine the backlash if we were caught?  We can ill afford a war with the librarians.”

“With all due respect… //fuck// the librarians.”

“Fff- ugh!  Your temper is unbearable, Yvonne!”

“You wanna go, Bertie!?”

Kiran then tapped on the altar again.  “Your bickering is going to give me a headache.  I will not hesitate to cast both of you out of this chamber if you can’t shut up and listen.”

The two shadows lowered their shoulders and paused to hear their leader speak.  “Now then, we have the book of shadows.  We have no reason to believe that this is another fake.  Several of our scholars are currently in the process of confirming this.  It is now or never.  And we must be quick about it.”

“Exactly, which is why we should send a member!”

“Yvonne, I know how strongly you are positioned on this, but I have decided.  The homunculus goes.  Bertrand is correct.  We are not in a political or offensive position to take on the librarians, because we will have to eventually now that we have taken their book.  The clock.  Is.  Ticking."

Kiran crowded the alter more with his dark presence.  "I've already asked the artificer supreme for her help in this.  SO!  I would prefer to not start your little cult war until //after// we get the second child, //yes//?”

The shadow cast by Yvonne shrunk back and mumbled, “Y-yes, your eminence.”

Kiran nodded and abruptly continued, “The homunculus goes.  Its lifespan outside is short, so if it is caught by the jailers it will merely dissipate into shadow within a week.  We can also claim deniability since neither of our members actually took the book.  We know the librarians keep a close watch on all of us.  Whatever we send should be completely and utterly insignificant and disposable should somethi-.”

[[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work/council_3_2.png width="500px"]]

It was at that moment when all three felt the presence of something watching them.  Standing at the base of the altar, no taller than the knees of their shadows, stood a cloaked cyclopic figure made of merged flesh and shadowstuff.  In its tiny hands it held the book of shadows tightly in its grasp.

Kiran’s shadow cleared his throat, even though his actual throat was in Jakarta.  The council stood silent and let the awkwardness hang heavy like smog in Beijing.  Unsure of how long the homunculus had been standing beneath them and listening, Kiran was the first to address it.  “Umber.  Looks like the scholars have released you early, but we are sending you out again.”

[[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work/umber_1.png width="200px"]]

**Umber.  The pointy limbed, one-eyed, hooded figure not even eight moons old stood before the council of three shades and said, "Has the eminence run dry of 'insignificant and disposable' shades? Has the plotting gone already awry? Awry awry? I'm ready to serve again all the same. Aye aye!"**

 "Aye."  Kiran nodded back to Umber.  "I am glad that you are willing, but not back to the library we send you.  Our plotting and situation demads us to send you to where the jailers have recently moved the second child so you can bring them back."

Kiran purposefully paused to let his orders sink in, not only for Umber but for his other subordinates to understand the finality of his decision.  “To bring back the child you will need to use that book in your arms to do so.  Casting a simple shadow bind from the book of shadows should be adequate enough for us to pull them out of its prison.  You will also be given additional help.  Yvonne, if you would.”

The feminine shadow slowly slithered forward and even though the shade lacked its owner’s facial features, Umber could still feel the scowl coming all the way from Canada.  Yvonne, high shadowmancer, stretched her finger and touched the ground where Umber was standing.  “I give you your own shadow to take with you.  On the outside, the black quintessence which gives you life will quickly wane." 

[[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work/umber_2.png width="300px"]]

"Having your own shadow will prevent your lifeforce from leaching out, but it will shrink all the same if you use any magic from the spellbook, or get hurt.  Once it is gone, there is little we can do to keep you alive.”  

Yvonne’s form the leaned in for effect.  “No mistakes.”

Kiran watched Yvonne’s motions as she returned to the altar.  He nodded to Bertrand, apprentice to the artificer supreme, to speak.

“Umber, the artificer supreme has granted you a familiar which should be arriv-“

[[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work/umber_3.png width="300px"]]

Before he could finish the syllable, a metal cone pierced the membrane of Umber’s shadow and stopped at his head level.  The soft peal of the ringing metal filled their heads with a dull noise.

“…ah.  A familiar to which you can command its actions.  You can also ring it to dim the perception and memories of those around you.  Antimemetic is what I believe the jailers call it.”

Kiran nodded again.  “Thank you, both.  Umber you have your orders."  Umber stood stoically, not really sure what to say or how to react to being given another assignment that very likely would be a suicide mission for any other member of the Umbra Cult.

[[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work/umber_4.png width="300px"]]

"We will now send you to the jailer’s prison in Indiana as close as we can approximate.  The shadowstuff will carry you as far as we can reach.  From there you can emerge from any dark corner in the vicinity.  May you recieve the child's blessings...”  Kiran, Bertrand, and Yvonne clasped their hands in contrition and summoned a way using Umber’s new shadow, which promptly swallowed its owner.  "...in shadow."

[[collapsible show="► Arrival at Site-81 [COMPLETE]" hide="▼ Close" hideLocation="both"]]

Submerged in the cold shadowstuff felt like being dunked into a lake in February.  After a moment in freefall, Umber was able to flail the pointy stubs that were its arms and make out the faint light piercing the membrane.  It was much like being under a blanket, crawling along the floor and looking through the threads.  To one looking from the outside, a seeping blackness would be seen crawling from the forest floor surrounding the facility.  Within it Umber was carried along, hopping from shadow to shadow in the afternoon sun.  

A large [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/secure-facility-dossier-site-81 81] was decaled on a sign.  Fencing stretched the outer perimeter to keep the main walls free of wildlife.  The hapless passenger easily creeped under the fencing and made its way past the first line of security.  

[[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work/sneak.png width="600px"]]

**Umber had some control of the shadowstuff, but wondered where was the best place to emerge from?**  There were a few drainage ducts.  There were dark corners.  There were vehicles on patrol.  Even the patrolling guards had shadows.  Lots of choices were available. 

 **Of course there was the vehicle pool to Umber's immediate right and with it a lone guard standing idle.**  Seemed easy enough to get started he thought.  Silently he slithered with the shadow stuff under one of the parked vehicles.  Pulling his head out of the inky blackness, he could feel his skin ache from the daylight.  If a shadow did not accompany him on this mission, for sure he would not have lasted more than an hour in this harsh environment.

 [[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work/sneak_1.png width="600px"]]

 Once Umber's whole body was pulled out, he crouched behind the driver's side wheel and began to plot the next move.  From the undercarriage, the heavy boots of the lone security guard could be made out.  Likely if Umber wanted access into the facility, he'd need to go through the easiest route... right through the main entrance.  

Such a brazen trick would be impossible with the current small and pointed stature.  However, Umber had the book of shadows in his possession.  A convincing disguise could be formed with a little magic.  Knowing full well that Umber had a limited pool of shadowstuff at his disposal, he'd need to limit the spell as much as he reasonably could.  Probably 30 minutes would be all he'd need, he thought.  

[[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work/sneak_2.png width="400px"]]

[[f>image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work/spell_1.png width="200px"]]

Umber turned the pages and found the incantations for shadeforms.  Such a spell allowed the caster to pull material from one's own shadow and surround themselves in a different form.  It would be solid enough even to interact with objects, but with limitations.  There were some exceptions to the spell but Umber did not have the time to research the text fully.  Nor did he have enough shadowstuff to spare in order to compile additional modifications or metaspells to the shadeform he needed.  He had to be conservative with what Yvonne gave him to work with.

Umber began to recite the words while concentrating on the humanoid form of a security guard.  The boots, legs, armor, and head.  Thank the second child that he did not need to put much detail into the face since the guards wore face masks.  After mumbling the final word, he then felt his shadow reach out and engulf him like a predator pouncing on prey.  It tightened around his limbs and body, until it became part of him.  The black outer shell swelled and firmed into a physical form until a humanoid shape began to coalesce.  The spell was working.

In hindsight, it was probably not wise to perform the spell while underneath a vehicle.

Umber winced after hitting his head against the drive shaft and grumbled to himself as he had to shimmy out from under the chassis, which was thankfully uplifted enough to not trap him.  Before propping himself up on his two legs, he noticed a plastic bag wedged under the rear wheel.  It was perfect for carrying his familiar since having a floating bell around one's head would be a red flag.  The familiar was quickly bagged and tied with a knot.

Umber shakily got up, dusted himself off, and used the side mirror of the vehicle to inspect his new form.  Near perfect, he thought.  All the essentials needed to pass as a security grunt from a glance.  It was then that Umber noticed he was being watched by the adjacent guard.  Clearing his throat, Umber produced his best impersonation of a human.

 "H-hullo."

 [[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work/sneak_4.png width="600px"]]

 "Hmm."

The man gave a grunt-nod and casually walked in the direction of the guard house that stood on the edge of the main thoroughfare of the facility.  Umber could make out the majority of the buildings from where he stood.  **It was now a matter of figuring out of how to get inside and where to go from there with a mere 29 minutes and 15 seconds left until the spell wore out.** 

**When in Rome, Umber thought.**  He trotted down the main road that led towards the administration building and observed what it was that made guards… well, guards.  He puffed up his chest like he had purpose and marched along.  He waved at a passing patrol vehicle as it drove out the gate even.  No smiles.  Just a grunt and a nod was all that he could expect as a response.  Up ahead he could see two guards in conversation.  

Umber briskly crossed the road and walked up to them.  After passing them he quickly crouched down to pretend he was tying his boot.  Gently he placed his familiar, which was still in the bag, on the ground next to him as to not inadvertently ring it.  Umber perched an ear over his shoulder pad so he could easily make out what was being said.

[[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work/sneak_5.png width="400px"]] 

“Yeah, but I think if you’re a Patriot’s fan you’re pretty much a dick on principle.”

“I hear ya, all my brother talks about is Brady this and Brady that.  Fucking sick of it.  AND he’s from New Mexico for fuck’s sake.”

The guard on the left chuckled, or what could be defined as a chuckle as he puffed a half breath of air through his nostrils and smiled.  “Heh, yeah… oh hey, you on patrol D or E today?  Powell is bringing in lunch during sentry change at thirteen hundred for A through D patrols.”

“Shit, I’m on F actually.  I’ll miss it.  What is it, pizza?  Throw a slice in the fridge for me?”

“Sure, it’ll be at the power station break room.  Slice of Hawaiian right?”

“Ew, fuck that.  Meat lovers.”

“I’ll do you a solid.  You hooked me up when Jacobs brought in breakfast burritos.”

“Those were good.  Had them little green chilies.”

"Maybe for you, gave me the squirts."

At this point, Umber was taking entirely too long tying a boot.  He picked up his bag and propped himself up to continue towards the administration offices.  Out the corner of his eye he could make out someone who was surprisingly not a guard hanging by the double doors of the admin building smoking a cigarette.  

There were also two individuals in blue jumpsuits unloading crates of equipment from a semi marked ‘SHIPPING CONTAINER PORTAGE INC’.  With a forklift, a crate the size of a fridge was hauled from the truck and into the long building just north of the administration office.  

Umber stopped and looked at the shadow he was casting with the sun.  High noon. **He also had only 23 minutes left in this form, so whatever he was going to do he needed to hurry up and get to it.**

**Umber looked at his shoes and legs.  If he had gotten this far without detection surely he could gain access to the admin building, he thought.  He pivoted and walked down along the backside of the admin building.**  Standing under the watchful eye of a security camera stood a man in a white coat smoking a cigarette.  His glasses were fixed on the movers who were unloading a crate, wondering when his department would receive the approval of new equipment.  

 [[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work/sneak_6.png width="500px"]] 

 Umber stopped in front of the door and tried the steel handle.  Not even a budge.  The older smoker did not budge either, his attention and thoughts far too distracted at that moment.  Umber's shoulders shrank as he surveyed the area a little better.  There was the badge reader adjacent to the door that had a weathered keypad.  Budgeting cuts this year have pushed off another update on replacing some of the security systems it seemed.  Umber crouched to get a better view of the keypad.

 [[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work/keypad.png width="200px"]] 

 Sure enough, looked like a used keypad.  Probably would be easier with a badge or an employee number or a secret code or a bomb, he thought.  **Stroking his fake chin, he pondered about what to do next.** Perhaps there was a pattern in the wear of the buttons, Umber thought.  Carefully deducing what looked like a pattern, he pressed his guess onto the keypad.  Each number made an audible but indistinguishable beep when pressed.

Nothing.  Umber paused in thought.  Something was not right here.  Perhaps, he thought, he needed to try those numbers again.  Extending a finger, he attempted to press the same combination of 38521.  However, as soon as he pressed 3 again...

The unblinking electronic eye flashed from yellow to red.  

"Shadjar!"  Umber mumbled the vulgar curse under his breath, a word that would likely turn the head of a fellow cultist.  **Obviously those numbers weren't right**, but now he knew that it had to be a 6-digit code.  There was also the question of how many tries he would have.  More importantly, how many tries would he have before it would look suspicious?  Perhaps making use of his newfound authority would work, Umber thought.  He cleared his throat and approached the smoking old man.

"Ahem."

There was no response from the man.  Umber tried again.

"AHEM!"

Like an owl, the old man's head swiveled to look at him.  The end of his cigarette burned idly as his eyes scanned Umber from helmet to boots.

"Yes?  What is it?"

"S-sire..."  Damn, is the proper usage sire or lord, Umber thought.  There was no time for a correction unfortunately.  **"...you are being urgently needed towards the insides."**  Perfect execution nonetheless.

The man stared blankly at Umber.  The cherry on his cigarette was still counting down the time between them. 

"Ohhh kay?  For what?"

[[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work/sneak_7.png width="500px"]]

 Slowly he turned his torso, exposing his ID badge.  Nothing that could have been read at a glance unfortunately.  Umber made a mental note of this but had to move on.

[[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work/keycard1.png width="200px"]]

"Well... I am just beings here to tell you that the peoples are needing you in an urgency."

The man's brow furrowed and the end of his cigarette flaked off in the breeze.  **There was the heavy impression that he needed more convincing.**  Glancing over at the commotion in front of them, it was clear that the aged smoker was irritated by it.  Envy perhaps?  **Yes, this human had a severe case of box envy, Umber thought.**    

 "Yes.  Urgencies.  As in they are bringings big boxes for you too.  Bigger boxes even."  He emphasized by spreading his arms apart.

 "The intangant specimen extraction chamber?  That must be it.  I put in a req for that last year and it's coming now?!  Always something on my cigarette break!"  The man flicked his cigarette into the gravel road, swiped his badge and hurried in.  Humans and their big boxes... so predictable.  Umber remembered the human holiday he read about where they covet their large boxes, but he would not consider this the strangest of human traits or even in the top five.  Before Umber finished his thought, he quickly slid right behind him before the door closed.

[[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work/sneak_8.png width="450px"]]

Umber's heavy boots clacked against the linoleum floor.  He squinted his eyes from the bright  fluorescent bulbs bearing down on him and his shade form.  A white hallway running east to west was visible as he stepped fully inside as the door closed and locked behind him.  No turning back now.  Umber caught one last glimpse of the man as he rushed through a double door at the west end of the hallway.  On the other end, an elevator and locker room with the hallway continuing around the corner.  Only him and dead silence existed in that hallway.  

 **Now to get on with finding the second child, Umber thought.** 
[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show="► A Foot in the Door [COMPLETE]" hide="▼ Close" hideLocation="both"]]

**Umber continued down the hallway, passing the elevator and locker room to see what else there was.**  Luckily, most of the doors were clearly labeled in the hallway going south.  Utilities, janitor's closet, and a medical room.  Another set of double doors were placed around the corner, but no windows.  Oddly enough, only the utilities and medical doors had ID scanners connected to them.  "This is going to be a shortest mission in the history of the cult if I can't get a hold of some access", Umber inwardly grunted.

 Seeing as the hallways were devoid of prying eyes, Umber casually slipped into the locker room to snoop around.  Again... boxes.

 [[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work/lockers_1.png width="600px"]]

 Metal boxes with locks.  Seriously, what is it with this box fetish?  Umber rolled his eyes and looked down to the other end.  Rows and rows of lockers and some toilet stalls.  Some lockers had a blue label and some with an orange label, whatever that meant.  The loud hum of ventilation filled the empty space while his boots echoed off the white tile.  As he approached, he bent his head down to see if anyone was occupying the stall.  To his relief, there was no one.  For a big building, it sure was empty.  

 Umber had seen this type of lock before and really all one needed to do was turn it the appropriate number of times in one direction or the other.  Starting with the first locker on his left he idly started twisting the knob this way and that.    

 [[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work/lockers_2.png width="600px"]]

 Umber curiously started to realize that the more he twisted the knob, the higher the locker went.  Perhaps this was not a lock but merely a box height adjuster.  He tried turning it back but it was not long before his arm was fully stretched.  When he looked down, Umber's eyes went wide with shock.

 [[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work/lockers_3.png width="200px"]]

The shade form was waning, and waning fast.  Another minute and he would be back to his regular stubby shape.  How unfortunate it was that just when the top lock was out of his reach, the intercoms then buzzed to life.  There was a short burst of static crackle followed by the squeaky voice of a young human female.

> "FIRST SHIFT LUNCH HOUR COMPLETE.  THOSE ON SHIFT CHANGE PLEASE REPORT TO YOUR CAPTAINS AT YOUR RESPECTIVE SECURITY CHECKPOINTS.  PLEASE TAKE NOTE THAT TODAY'S SECURITY TOPIC IS TERMAINAL PASSWORDS.  WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU CHANGED YOURS?  THANK YOU AND HAVE A NICE DAY."

Nearly half of his shade form gone, Umber could hear the shuffling of humans in the hallway.  They must have been eating.  And what do humans do after they are done eating food?  They expel it from their other smaller mouth!  **Umber was not in a good position at all, and he needed to think of something quickly before someone discovered him.** 

With two nubby legs, he scrambled to the far side of the room.  As his shade form melted away, he looked toward his familiar whom was wiggling inside the bag.  **Let them come**, he thought as he used his stubby hands to rip open the bag.  Just as two humans walked in, Umber clutched his book closely and glared at them.  One guard and one other human dressed in a dull orange carrying a toolbox.

The two didn't notice Umber crouching on the floor at first all the while the familiar slowly rose above Umber's head and hovered quietly.  The human in orange was first to notice and quickly tapped on the shoulder of the guard.  

 "Wha-  Oh shit what the what?!"  As the guard reached for a sidearm and the orange human was almost able to reach for the radio on their hip.

A single note hung in the air for far longer than what could have been achieved with any normal metal.  The peal of the familiar's ring resonated into the eardrums of the humans and disrupted specific electrical signals in their brains.  It had worked.  As the two stood dazed, Umber quickly ducked into an adjacent stall and clamored up onto the toilet seat.  There he could wait it out.

 "What?"

 "Hmm?"

 "What was I saying, Jess?"

 "I dunno.  'Scuse me, gotta get to my locker."

The lockers.  **If they were going to open them, maybe Umber could see the combinations.**  However, the walls of the stalls were enormous.  Umber had another idea though.  He climbed up onto the tank of the toilet, and then gingerly pulled himself up onto the familiar.  It was just enough to reach the top with his arms and pull up.  From there Umber shimmied across the edge to get a better look.  

One human went for a top locker and the other a bottom locker.  Blue locker, blue badge for the guard.  Orange locker, orange badge for the other human.  But what do orange humans do?  On the floor, there was another box that the orange human was moving things in and out of.  Tools perhaps?  Umber paid careful attention to the combinations of both, and it was a good thing he had a steel trap for a memory.  Literally, the artificer supreme made sure that the steel-trap card was used during his own forging.

**22 right, 13 left, 02 right.**  The locker on the bottom opened with a pop.  **14 right, 34 left, 37 right** and pop went the top locker.  Umber couldn't help but make another observation on this strange box phenomenon.  Humans putting things from a box into another box, while Umber watched from a box.  With mild fascination, he watched the two go about their business and chat it up a little.

[[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work/lockers_5.png width="650px"]]

"You pulling a double today?"  The guard looked over their shoulder as they removed their helmet.

"IT never sleeps.  Gotta go route some network cable for a work order Bob and Karen are wrapping up in D-Wing."  The orange dressed human began exchanging tools from locker to toolbox.  They had a bigger locker and for good reason.  Umber could see the insides crowded with all sorts of metal ratchets, cutters, and instruments.

"Yuck, I hate being sub-level."  

"That's cuz you're claustrophobic, Alex."

"And keep that to yourself.  Don't need that on my record somewhere."  The guard donned a regular buttoned shirt but still kept their sidearm and ID badge on them as they closed their locker with a resounding clang.

"I'm sure it already is.  Personnel has dirt on everyone and everything."

"That's why I don't talk to any of them.  Just other guards and maintenance folks... and the occasional researcher if they're cool.  Some of them are ok.  When do you get off?"

"Late.  Probably into third shift.  But I won't complain.  It's overtime on containment pay and I never say no to that."  The human snapped their fingers and pointed at the guard.  

"Must be nice."  Commented the guard as they started to step out.  "Buying rounds later at Marley's, moneybags?"

"Maybe.  Are you going to ask Ash out?"  The orange one closed their locker and picked up the toolbox, now looking heavier than before.

"Y-yeah, after you buy me a round."  

"You'll never ask him out even if I bought the bar."

"Shut up."

Eventually the two shuffled out of the room.  The shuffling from outside also got quieter and quieter.  **Umber watched from the top of the stall and thought about when he could make the next move and what move that should be.** 

**Obviously, there would be some useful things in those lockers, Umber thought.**  When he started to worm his way back down, he suddenly had lost his grip and fell into the toilet.

= **SPLOOSH**

"Shadjar!" he gurgled as he wriggled out of the bowl and plopped onto the tile.  Wet and cold, he shook out his robe and picked up the book, which thankfully was still resting and dry on the top of the tank.  The familiar looked down at its owner in bewilderment.  "Some help you are," Umber barked back as he twisted the bottom of his robe to wring out the water.  He tried to one last wringing before retrieving his book all the while pushing the idea out of his mind on what humans actually do in these stalls.

Ducking underneath the stall, Umber surveyed the room and breathed a sigh of relief.  The first on to try would be the guard's locker.  Being as high as it was, Umber made use of a janitor's bucket to stand on to work the combination.  Glancing over his shoulder, he could see his familiar seemingly watching him work.  “Can’t you stand watch or something?  You are making me nervous.”

[[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work/lockers_6.png width="650px"]]

The familiar gave a curt nod and drifted a little further toward the exit.  “Better.  Now let me work this.”  He turned back around, holding his precious book in one hand and turning the lock with the other.  More than concentrating on the numbers, he was actually more nervous about falling into another container of water. 

It took only three tries to get the knob on the right combination of numbers.  There was a metal click and a squeak of accomplishment as the first locker was opened.  Umber's large eye peeked in and made a mental list of all the things inside:

* a paper tree
* a lightning bite gun
* a key
* a box of nine mm's
* three tunics
* a rounded hat
* and a red amulet of knife summoning

[[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work/footlocker_19.png width="300px"]] 

Umber hummed in thought as he left the door open and clamored down to the other locker owned by the orange human.  This time it had only taken one try to unlock it.  Pushing the metal door aside, Umber made another mental list of its contents:

* purple rope
* unpointed scissors
* a sheaf of loose papers
* a... thing with buttons?
* two badge blanks
* a rectangle named "Coco Loco"
* and the glue of a krazy

[[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work/footlocker_21.png width="300px"]] 

Taking a step back, Umber looked at the contents of both lockers.  It was a lot to carry and he was going to be very selective if he were to carry anything by hand or bag.  The book itself took up an arm, so taking on more supplies than his body would allow would have been a real burden.  **Umber made a thorough decision.**

Well firstly, one should look through the papers to see what is in there, Umber thought.  **He reached for the manila envelope and looked through it.**  It all... looked useful enough but was a lot to memorize for one homunculus.  Blue maps.  Lots of rectangles.  Color codes.  Numbers and letters.  Umber closed it and put it back, maybe if he had them on hand he could better use them in the moment when they made sense.

[[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work/lockers_7.png width="600px"]] 

Now for the supplies.  Umber looked over his shoulder at the empty bathroom stall.  His idea was to make a little temporary stockpile of loot while he worked on learning the button device.  Clever clever clever, Umber thought as **he gathered the red amulet of knife summoning, the lightning bite gun, the key, and a blank badge.**  There was too much in his arms to carry the book of shadows as well so he placed it near the lockers for now.  He then gently placed each item on top of the tank of the toilet and went for the second trip.  **The button device.**

[[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work/lockers_8.png width="400px"]] 

It was bulky in his hands but not too cumbersome.  After scrambling to the top of the toilet seat with the device, Umber put it in his lap and studied it.  It looked to be on already so he read the screen.

It all seemed simple enough.  Having a brand new badge seemed to be the way to go.  Something important and would give him all the access he would need.  An ultimate super access card.  "Let's make that," he said aloud.

"Hmmmm."  Umber paused in thought, then plucked the stylus from the side and tapped on the screen's keyboard.

He grunted in frustration with no ultimate super access card in his reach.  Next on the list was copy.  Umber tapped on the triangle.

Umber was about to select the stolen option, but seeing as that is what he was trying to do he instead selected the expired option, thinking it'd be the least suspicious.  "Almost tricked me," he mumbled under his breath.

Back.  Back.  Back.

He huffed while furrowing the brow over his eye as he selected the next option.

It was the first time the device prompted him for a badge to insert into the slot.  Reaching behind him, he grabbed a blank badge and slid it in.  His little legs involuntarily swung back and forth in anticipation.

> {{| Please insert the badge you are trying to edit.}}

He sighed.  "Back.  Back.  Back."

The last one to select was read, Umber did not know what to expect.  He wiggled the card in the slot to make sure it was still firmly in.

Umber shook the device in frustration.  His familiar cautiously backed away to let Umber have his little tantrum.  This was not the big payoff he was expecting.  Just as he quieted down, there was a loud bang in the stall next to him.  Umber was so startled that he nearly dropped his device.  After a short pause, the sound of scraping nails on the other side of the wall echoed in the empty restroom.  **Umber froze trying to figure out what to do.**  

What was a sure fire way to drive off a human, Umber thought.  Of course.  Every human runs for the hills whenever one of them nearby gives off their bathroom call.  He remembered this from one of the comedic books he read during his time in cult library.  Flatoolance is what they called it.  **Umber pursed his lips and then blew the loudest wettest noise he could produce into the palms of his hands.**

= **PBPBPBBPBPBBPBPBPTPBBPTTPBBTPBPBPTBPBPT!**

[[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work/lockers_9.png width="400px"]] 

There was no response.  He had to double-down much to the embarrassment of his familiar who could only float and watch.

"Oh Gods!  There's so much!  Ugh!"

**PBPBPBBBPBPTBPBPT!**

"The indignity!  The horror!  All is lost!"

**PBBPBPTBPPBPBBBPBP!  PTB!  PTB!  TBPBPT!****

Umber dropped the gun into the water to add to his performance.  It made a loud splash but there was still silence from the other stall.  Umber knew his bluff was being called out and he was forced to take a rash action.  Quickly hopping down off the porcelain throne, he grabbed the gun from the water, approached the adjacent stall and kicked the door in.  Suddenly he felt the urge to blurt out a human curse for effect.

"DIE YOU FUCKER OF MOTHERS!"

Empty.

At this point, Umber could only stand confused but at least the claw marks on the wall were a validation that he did in fact hear something next to him.  "We need to go."  The familiar nodded in agreement.  With no time to spare, Umber gathered the rest of the small items on the top of the toilet and looked for an exit.  On the ceiling there was an air vent, which Umber could probably climb up to.

Scrambling up the side of the lockers, he was able to position himself to unlatch the vent cover.  The familiar floated up first to ensure the coast was clear.  With a heave and pull, **Umber wriggled up into the vent** and closed the cover behind him. 

[[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work/lockers_12.png width="600px"]] 

It was dark, but it was the stuff he was born of and felt quite comfortable even though his vision was less than spectacular.  There were two passages.  One to the south where a loud humming noise was coming from.  The other to the west that seemed to lead off into the dark with another tunnel a little further ahead.  The wind in the vent also seemed to be blowing to the west as well.  Umber shivered in the cool dry air, tucked the gun into his robe along with the other items, and **looked to see which direction would be the better choice.**

**Umber decided to move westward**, away from the humming noise that was likely a large spinning fan ready to chop him into little pieces.  Likely the mechanism was responsible for supplying the cool air and moving it along the vent.  It was cold inside the narrow space, but pretty berable.  He adjusted himself and took a crouched position with his familiar floating closely beside him.  "Alright now, let's do this quietly," Umber whispered over his shoulder.  The familiar responded with a brief nod.

 As they both wriggled down the vent it progressively got darker.  

 [[div style="text-align: left; background: linear-gradient(to bottom, #fff, #000, #000, #000, #000, #000, #000, #000, #000, #000, #000, #fff); padding: 5px;"]]

 And darker.

 [[div style="color: #fff;"]]

 And finally dark enough that Umber felt at his most comfortable.  For him, darkness felt like slipping into a cool bed on a hot night.  It was the bright light that really got to him.  Like sharp a sharp tingly sensation on your skin, it was not very soothing at all.

 [[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work/vent_1.png width="100px"]]

 Umber could make out enough in the dark.  Shape and dimension was easy enough to discern, which is all you really need when navigating in blackness.  On the left, he passed another passage that ran south but he pressed on.  Very carefully he made sure that he made the most minimal amount of sound as the metallic vent would surely amplify any misteps.  He actually had a lot of practice being stealthy during his assignments to sneak into the library.

 Another passage on his right this time that ended with a vent.  Umber stopped to hear any noise coming from it but the hum from the machine behind him was still too loud.  If he wanted to hear anything from these vents, he'd have to travel all the way to the end.  Ahead there was a long stretch which looked to fork out in four different direction.  He contiued on to see what was up ahead.

 When he got there he could see another tunnel extending south and one ending north.  And yet again, the drowning hum of the machine was too much to hear from the vent, if anything could have been heard.  The familiar then tapped Umber on the shoulder.  "What is it," he whispered back.

 [[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work/vent_2.png width="100px"]]

 The familiar made some vague motions but Umber stood hunched over confused.  "What?  I can't understand you... maybe the artificer supreme should have given you a mouth."

 Again, the familiar tried to gesture, but could only wiggle and twist indescernably.  Umber however finally understood what it was trying to say.  "This isn't the time for that.  You should have went when we were in the bathroom."  With that he pressed on ahead.  The familiar twitched in frustration and returned to his side, floating more closely behind him now.

At last they made it to the turn, which went south.  Another great machine with spinning blades could be seen at the turn, but it appeared to be off.  Lucky for Umber as he and his familiar slipped by and continued running down the tunnel.  Umber eventually made it all the way to the end.  There he could see many vents all blowing the cool air into what seemed like a clustered space.  Through the slots he could see large black boxes with lights sitting in a room.  No human voice though.  Again another room dedicated to the divine box.  He scratched his noggin in thought and tried to lift up one of the grates.  Unfortunatley it was bolted down.

"I think I have just the thing for this,"  He mumbled to his familiar as he produced the red amulet of knife summoning.  

"I command thee... to open."

Nothing.

"By the powers in shadow... open."

Nothing.

"Tiṟanta?"

Still nothing.

"Shadjar.  Open please?"

He shook it in his hand like it needed to wake up.  Eventually he sighed and came to the realization that he needed to try a different approach.

Umber then took his time and examined it closely to see if there were any inscriptions he may have missed.  Maybe it wasn't magical at all?  As he studied it in the light of a vent, the air temperature dropped a few more degrees.  Not that it would have been terribly noticeable in the already cold space, but the metal familiar was sure sensitive of it.  

Slowly turning, the familiar looked behind Umber to see a single red eye staring back in the darkness.  It dripped blood.  Unbliking.  Hungry.  The small familiar trembled and gave a very small peal of alarm.  

"Oh, look there.  You just pull up on this thingy,"  Umber was preoccupied as he pulled up on the notch to produce a flathead screwdriver.  "Clever human tool."

A claw silently stretched out from the black void and slowly reached for Umber.  Sharp grey claws opened like a blossom, ready to dig and tear into flesh.  The familiar backed into Umber and vigorously tapped against him to get his attention.

[[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work/vent_3.png width="300px"]]

When the familiar turned around to show Umber, the hand and eye had vanished.  Typical, it thought as it turned back around to see its master staring sternly back.  Slowly it backed up an inch to give its master some space.  Umber huffed and made sure the screwdriver fit on the head of the screw, which luckily enough it did.  He assumed that he could open any vent he wanted, even the ones he passed by.  **He just had to choose which one to pop open and slip out.**

**That room with the large black boxes looked enticing**, Umber thought.  Placing the screwdriver into the head of each screw was an agonizing process considering Umber barely had the strength to crack each screw to turn it.  When the last screw was pulled the grate swung down.  The creaking hinge was drowned out up by the hum of the room.  Each box was at least three Umbers tall and had all manner of cables and lights and whirring fans.  It was also noticeably warm.  
  
Umber gave a hand signal for the familiar to go first.  Call it penance for being a pain in the rear earlier.  The familiar then reluctantly dipped through the opening and surveyed around the large space. No human presence was visible.  It gave a brief nod-nod to Umber, signaling it was safe to come down.

“Alright… let me just go legs first… Mfhmf!”

Umber’s stubby legs kicked in the air as he tried to reach the top of the nearest box.  Still unable to make contact, he inched down a little bit more.  Then some more.  "It feels like I'm almost there."  Umber inched a little further with his legs fluttering desperately to feel something solid.  Then he lost his grip altogether.  His side caught the edge of the large box as he tumbled down past the lights and cables until the floor suddenly caught up with him.  There was an audible “PLAT” as the pliable body of shadowstuff, bird bones, cloth, and other unmentionables that was a homunculus landed face first onto the hard linoleum.  His familiar looking down at him, wondering what to do next.

[[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work/server_2.png width="600px"]]

“I… I’ll need a minute,” Umber stated.  For sure, that hurt more than he expected and he would likely regret not taking something to repel down with either.  There was no time to focus on the pain.  Slowly he propped himself up with his arms, then stepped up and stood fully.  The familiar floated down to his level to make sure he was well.

“I’m alright.  Just shaken.  By the way, what was that all about in the tunnels?” Umber inquired.

The familiar simply twitched back and forth.

“We are under enough stress.  No more antics.  Understand?”

The familiar gave another firm nod-nod.  Umber nodded as well and looked about.  Just rows and rows of covetous boxes with the only thing breaking up the monotonous droning hum is the rushing of air from the above vents.  A lone computer terminal stood squeezed between two monoliths.  The grey desk shoulder to shoulder in the cramped space with an elongated screen sitting on top of it.  The only thing on the screen was the familiar Foundation logo and a white bar where the cursor blinked.  Must be locked, Umber thought as he scrambled up the chair.  Getting up onto the seat was not as hard as his sudden descent, but navigating in a human environment was beginning to be more and more of a challenge as the mission went on.

When he finally got up to the desk, he squinted at the username and spoke it aloud, "Jesse Abbot... an abbot? I didn't know the jailers had a monastery."  There was more to read under the name.  "IT Technician... it technician.  Jesse Abbot, it technician?  Is that just rude or poor grammar?  I can't tell."  He looked to the familiar for comment, but pushed the notion away as he remembered that it didn't even have a mouth.

“Nevermind.  Just watch for humans while I figure this out.”  

The familiar dipped up and down and then hovered up higher to get a better vantage point.  It would not be able to hear a human in this noisy room, but at least it could see one.  Umber paused as he glanced at his familiar that floated above him.  

“**I need to give you a name.**  It would make it easier to scold you when I need to.”  

The familiar ignored the rude comment and continued to make up for its lackluster performance and focus on sentry duty.  Umber shook his head to get his bearing and noticed the handle in front of him.  A desk drawer.  Pulling it towards him, he found a few curious items.

[[image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work/server_3.png width="450px"]]

* A marker of permanency
* A sheaf of loose papers
* An obsidian tablet
* A small handwritten note

**He studied what he should do with them, if anything.  "Well this obsidian tablet and the marker may have some use," he decided.**

He took the two items out of the drawer and gingerly placed the lightning bite gun in its place.  This is a stealth mission anyhow, can't be shooting people when one is vastly outnumbered.  Then there was the computer screen in front of him.  A password seemed to be the only thing between Umber and the digital treasure trove he has been groping for since messing with the button device in the bathroom.  "A nickname...."

[[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work/server_4.png width="600px"]]

= **J-E-S-S**

The computer flashed a window back at him.  "Login incorrect?  Ugh... I'll be all day at this trying to guess nicknames."  He tried to think of a few more just to be sure pulling the keyboard closer into his lap to better reach.  "Familiar, what are some good human nicknames?  Fleshy?  Pinksac?  Hairblob? Meatface?  Ben?"

The familiar twitched at the name Ben.  "Ben?  I'll try."

= **B-E-N**

Again, he was blocked.  "No no no, that one is no good.  Ben is a dumb name... huh... you know, that's the name I'm giving you for such a dumb suggestion."  Ben did not react to the rude comment and continued to watch for humans.  Umber rubbed his temples and tried to think harder, there must have been a master password that supersedes this one... like a skeleton key.

= **I-L-O-V-E-B-O-X**

= **A-L-L-H-A-I-L-B-O-X**

= **B-O-X-F-O-R-T-H-E-B-O-X-G-O-D**

All failed.  Umber grunted in frustration and pulled out the obsidian tablet, perhaps it would be more helpful.  He fumbled with the tablet in his small appendages looking to see how it operates.  Unintentionally, he pressed the circle on the bottom and the tablet lit up with shapes and colors.  It surprised Umber so much that he nearly dropped the thing, thinking he had activated some sort of terrible spell to trap any poor unfortunate creatures in a hypnotic trance.  After about five seconds of wincing, Umber exhaled pushed the previous notion aside.  He looked at the screen to see what he could find useful to him.

[[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work/phone_1.png width="300px"]]

Well there were many useful things.  If only he understood what half of this meant he could probably get some overdue hints on what to do.  Umber noticed the orange button which said 'Text'.  Well he was looking for text, a very specific text as the password.  He pressed it and it grew instantly to cover the screen.  There was only a single message sent from what appeared to be another human.

[[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work/phone_2.png width="300px"]]

"Moneybags?  I thought this was Jesse... ooooooooooh."  Umber's brain clicked and whirred with excitement as he put the phone down and typed his newly found clue into the computer screen.

= **M-O-N-E-Y-B-A-G-S**

The screen flashed the words 'Welcome' and Umber squeaked with joy.  The biggest victory yet since sneaking in.  He put his hands together in anticipation to see what he could discover.

[[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work/comp_1.png width="600px"]]

"Errrr...."  

Umber sat even more confused than previously when he was in the bathroom stall.  Where was the information?  Where was the payoff?  And what the hell is a dumpster doing here?  He slouched in his seat feeling a little defeated.  He almost wished the council of 3 shades had sent an actual agent and he could go back to sneaking into the library for books.  "They should have sent a human, Ben."

Ben tilted slightly down to face Umber.  It almost felt sorry for its master but knew there was little it could do to help.  Umber had to soldier on.  As a homunculus... no... as a member of the Cult of New Umbra he had to have faith.  The second child needed to be freed.  He propped himself back up, grabbed the mouse, and shakily dragged it across the screen to **see what he could dig up in cyberspace.**

**Umber decided to look through the phone first.**  Luckily, it didn't have any security features on it.  Probably the IT plebian assigned to it had ways to keep it unlocked for ease of use.  Blessed be the lazy who make subterfuge that much easier, Umber thought to himself.  Using his little digits, he thumbed through the email of one Jesse Abbot.

 [[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work/phone_3.png width="300px"]]

Only a few messages but nothing referring to the second child.  Umber sighed and pushed the phone back down into his tunic.  **He pulled the rolling chair closer to the screen and squinted at the icons.**  "L-lodestar work orders.  Who is doing the ordering?"  Umber pushed on the icon with a thumb, but nothing.  "C'mon... blasted device."  Another firm tap on the LCD screen.  "Why is nothing intuitive?"  He bumped the table with a frustrated fist and made the whole thing rattle.  The tiny arrow in the center of the screen moved ever so slightly, and thankfully caught the eye of Umber.

He looked at the mouse and poked it with a hesitant finger.  Again the arrow had moved.  Umber then draped a hand over the mouse and slid the arrow across the screen, this way and that.  "Ah... alright."  He unskillfully moved the arrow and clicked the lodestar icon.  A window flew up into the screen and populated a display with table of ongoing repairs to the site.

Umber hummed while reading them making little mental notes here and there.  He got distracted a little by the dumpster icon with a '1' floating in the corner.  He clicked and another display flew up at him.  A lonely file with a strange name was the only thing in there.  "Tckts file.  What's a tckts file?," he asked rhetorically.

Umber nodded and moved on.  He glanced at the AIC helpdesk.  Help?  Well that's for sure what he needed at the moment rather than blindly probing through the computer desktop hoping to hit paydirt.  He clicked on it and a display with a curious looking avatar flickered up.

Umber rolled his eye and leaned back a little.  "A little bit of this thing goes a long way," Umber mumbled.  The plucky Virgil created another window and loaded up the SCP_Badger program, running through the prompts in milliseconds.

And just like that, it was completed.  Umber craned his neck to see the printer on the far end of the server row.  It was blinking yellow as if waiting on something.  Umber pushed off from the desk and rode the rolly chair down the linoleum highway.  His momentum, however, puttered out about three-quarters of the way there.  Umber simply huffed in frustration, clamored down the black plastic deskchair, and walked the rest of the way.  

"You plug it in yet, partner?" the computer speakers blurted out from the desk.  Umber winced, "I should have tried to mute it." 

There was a thin slot, clearly used for inserting cards.  Umber crammed the blank badge into the huge machine and watch the light shift from a solid yellow light to a blinking one.  There was a rush of hot air as the fans kicked back on and the sounds of whirring motors and toner filled the cramped space.  After about ten seconds, a new badge was produced.  It had a new mutable matrix barcode and a fancy orange border.  Finally, Umber had a badge.

[[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work/keycard2.png width="200px"]]

Umber held it high in a feeling of triumph.  The sneaking around.  The stealing of items.  The making of lewd noises on the toilet.  The fall from the cieling.  He was finally vindicated in his struggling.  Things were finally starting to turn around for Umber and Ben.

 = "Lemme go!  NNNHMF!"

 The ghost had a strong grip.  Umber flailed desperately to break free but it was no use.  How could a ghost be so strong, he thought.  He tried to reach for the nearest server rack to grab hold of, but it seemed to be just out of his reach.  If he couldn't break free, **maybe he could intimidate it by pretending to be a ghost as well.**

 "I'm a terrible ghost tooooooooo!  And if yoooooooou don't release me, I'll overpower yoooooou!  I'll inhale your ectoplasm and make it my oooooooooown.  OOOoooOOOOooooOoOOoOOooOO!" Umber was sure that his ghost accent was dead on.  Very dead on in fact.

 The ghost blinked and tilted her head ever so slightly.  In a corrosive whisper, she spoke to Umber in a calm and inquisative tone "You are a ghost?"

 "Y-yeah.  Yes I am.  Now let go or feel my horrific undead fury."  Umber was still trying to pull away forcefully.

 "But you know what this is."  The ghost held up a book.  The book of shadows.  The one he completely forgot about in the bathroom and the one thing that was going to help him release the second child when he found it.

 [[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work/server_6.png width="400px"]]

 "...oh..." was all that Umber could say.

 The ghost pulled the book away and made it vanish into her own ethereal essence.  Then she released him.  "Now there are two of us.  Now we can make them pay.  How I've waited for another."

 Umber rubbed his wrist trying to deice it after being in her frosty grip.  "What are you?"

 "I am like you.  A ghost.  Torn from my body and tortured by these people.  Even in death, I do not find peace.  There is only my hate that keeps me here.  After being tortured, I learned their ways.  I learned their machines.  I figured out where to slip through the cracks of information.  I waited when the time was right and was able to fabricate my very existence.  They don't even remember me, now.  But I am not done.  My name is [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2996 Emily] and I will raze this place into the ground for what was done to me.  How I've waited for another."

 Umber hesitantly took a half a step back.  "O... kay?  Well, that //is// interesting.  My name is Umber and I'll just need my book back so..."

 "UUUUMMMMMBERRRRRRRRRRRRR."  Emily vanished and reappeared behind Umber in a flash.  She held him very close in her frozen claws in almost an affectionate way.

 [[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work/server_7.png width="300px"]]

 "Y-yes that's me.  I just want my boo-"

 "Umber, Umber, Umber... you and I are going to work together.  I read your book.  It has amazing power that we can tap into.  Together we can cause chaos.  Together we can sew destruction.  Together we can burn a hole so deep that they would never //ever// dare to do to another like they did to me."

 Umber recoiled a little as a long claw poked him in the mid-section.  He could feel the icy tip even through his tunic.  "Well, I do like me some mayhem, but I'm really here to accomplish just the one thing."  Her grip tightened a little and her bleeding red eye grew into a hellish portal, which echoed the screams of Emily's past.

 "WE WILL ACCOMPLISH MANY THINGS, UMBER." 

 [[=image http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/lurk-work/server_8.png width="300px"]]

 "WE WILL WATCH THE RECKLESS ABANDON OF THEIR CAGED HORRORS TEAR THEIR WAY OUT.  WE WILL SEE THE LAKE SET AFLAME.  WE WILL SEE THE EARTH OPEN ITS TERRIBLE MAW AND SWALLOW THE EVIL OF THIS PLACE.  AND WHEN THE SURVIVORS TRY TO RUN FROM THE RUINS TOWARD SAFETY, WE WILL BE AWAITING THEM WITH OPEN CLAWS.  CAN'T YOU SEE?  CAN'T YOU SEE THAT WE WILL ACCOMPLISH SO MUCH MORE.  AND WHEN THE HATE IN OUR SOULS WASHES OVER THIS PLACE, THEY WILL KNOW THAT IT WAS THEIR OWN HANDS WHICH CAUSED THEIR DOOM.  AND THEY WILL LAMENT OVER WHAT THEY DID TO ME.  AND I WILL STAND OVER THE ASHES.  AND I.  WILL.  LAUGH."

 Umber looked immensely worried.  "Um... yeah, but-” Her grip tightened to the point of almost being considered painful.

 "WITH YOUR BOOK.  WITH YOUR HELP.  WE WILL ACCOMPLISH ALL OF THIS.  YOU AND ME.  ALL WILL SUFFER.  ALL WILL DIE.  **WHAT SAY YOU, UMBER?**"
