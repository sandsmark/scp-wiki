**Item #:** SCP-2324

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** A single living specimen of SCP-2324-A, hereafter SCP-2324-A-1[[footnote]]Formerly Darrel Dixon of Gary, IN[[/footnote]], is to be kept in a high security containment vault at Site-58. All other instances of SCP-2324-A are to be destroyed upon discovery. Site-58 has been equipped with optima-class insecticide dispensers to be used in the event of a containment breach. All crucial personnel at Site-58 are required to receive optima immunization at a separate site - no optima vaccine is to be present at Site-58. If deployment of optima gas proves ineffective to re-contain SCP-2324-A-1, the site's 5-megaton incendiary charges are to be activated. 

**Description:** SCP-2324 is a phenomenon associated with the western honey bee[[footnote]] //Apis mellifera// [[/footnote]] and its parasitic interaction with humans. SCP-2324-A denotes a human infected with SCP-2324. The injection mechanism for SCP-2324 through a specialized bee sting to a living human.

A fully infected SCP-2324-A instance is clinically dead, but maintains life functions under a new, altered consciousness controlled by an unknown means, presumably by bees within the body of the individual instance. The brain of an SCP-2324-A instance is replaced with a new structure superficially resembling a beehive, in which regular honey bees produce, nurture, and deploy biologically modified, notably more aggressive honeybees via the nostrils, mouth, and other cavities. SCP-2324-A instances are capable of speech in the host's native language, and an instance will refer to itself as an individual warship belonging to a greater army known by such names as “the Hive Authority,” “Her Majesty’s Fleet,” and “the Queen’s Navy.”
