__**POI-78559 Personal Statement:**__
> Hello everyone!
> 
> Welcome to my author page. I am currently a college student with a great interest in bettering my writing skill, which is why I'm getting a minor in creative writing. I've written a few SCPs so far, and I'm so happy to be among the great writers of this site. I am always looking to improve my skill, so please give feedback on any and all of my works here! I am always open to being messaged any questions, comments, or just casual conversation topics, so please, feel free to smash that "Write Private Message" button.
> 
> I'm currently transitioning so if any trans writers on the SCP Foundation just have questions about the process, or if anyone wants to include trans characters and wants a consultant on accurate portrayals, I'm //more// than happy to discuss those topics too.
> 
> I'm happy to be here on this website. Thank you all for giving me a proper creative outlet where I can actual feel like people are enjoying my works.
> 
> Much love,
> //Lady Zero//

**__Known Works:__**

The following are categorized by order of discovery.

* [[[SCP-3778|SCP-3778 "We Are Possum. We Are Legion."]]]
> **Authorial Commentary:** Anomalous grapes that make opossums gain sapience. My favorite animals are opossums so I figured that'd be a lovely thing to write about.

* [[[SCP-4994|SCP-4994 "An Ideal Foundation"]]]
> **Authorial Commentary:** Quite possibly the best article I have written or will write for the Foundation. A parallel, more successful version of the Foundation that is used by the OTL Foundation for advice. Has the highest rating of all my articles.

* [[[SCP-4899|SCP-4899 "Blackbody"]]]
> **Authorial Commentary:** An anomalous radio source from 144 light years away seems to be transmitting photos of places about to experience disaster. I got the name and idea from a Death Grips song.

* [[[SCP-4250|SCP-4250 "Colorful Pens With Thematic Ends"]]]
> **Authorial Commentary:** Pens designed by an AWCY member that have compulsory writing effects, with different colors corresponding to different themes. My most recent work and the first one I've written since I moved to college. Was inspired by a book I read when I was a kid.

More works are expected to follow. Foundation assets are recommended to continue watching for increases in POI-78559's writing proficiency, and to view any new works written. Upvotes encouraged, //only if// such works merit them.

**Secure, Contain, Protect.**
