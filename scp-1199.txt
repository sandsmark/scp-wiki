**Item #:** SCP-1199

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1199 is kept in its original container in a medium security containment locker; accessible for research purposes by Level 2 or higher Sector-25 personnel.

**Description:** SCP-1199 is a can of 'British Paints Limited' paint. Markings date the item to 1943. The can is filled to 50% of volume with a beige liquid which resembles acrylic paint. Early testing revealed trace biomass within the liquid.

When spread onto a surface as paint, the liquid takes on a slight red tone which fades as it dries. The final dry color is a pale white. Within the first hour of drying, treated surfaces will begin to radiate a small amount of heat. Soon after, the surface will become slightly glossy due to slight secretion of sebaceous oil.

When peeled from a surface and examined, the treatment behaves like a latex paint. Microscopic examination shows structure identical to human epidermis. All samples 0.10 mm or greater thickness contained all skin between the cornified and basal layers, as well as a variable thickness //stratum lucidum//. Treated surfaces will collect environmental dirt, "shed" top layers and are reactive to ultraviolet light by way of melanin.

> //Researcher's Note:// During properties testing, supervised handler D-1199-1 managed to create blisters, boils and calluses while applying the treatment to surfaces. Subject stated previous artistic inclination; subject was ordered to teach the skill to a level-1 researcher. Skill successfully replicated by researcher 1/1199 ███████. D-1199-1 terminated on schedule.

The source of SCP-1199's biochemical energy is unknown. Sunburn will effectively remove treatment from a surface, as will an industrial solvent like turpentine. Stripped surfaces retain no anomalous traits. Liquid remains at a constant viscosity while in it's can; research into possible anomalous properties of can ---pending--- on hold until conclusion of medical research.

**addendum:** //SCP-1199 cleared for medical research per O5-█.//
