**Item #:** SCP-XXXX

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-XXXX is to be kept in a 8 meter by 10 meter cell in the medium containment zone of Site-64. The cell is to be fitted with a 5 meter trough on the east wall of the cell. SCP-XXXX is to be sheared of its excess mass and have its cell cleaned once every week. X-rays are to be performed on SCP-XXXX before and after shearing. The resulting meat is to be incinerated. SCP-XXXX is to be fed a diet of raw beef, hay, wood, and bricks. Constant is not necessary, though SCP-XXXX must be checked at a minimum of three times a day. In a scenario where growth can not be regulated the object class is to be reevaluated.

**Description:** SCP-XXXX a bovine-esque creature measuring 3.4 meters tall and 5 meters long at the time of writing. Its skin is thin, appearing translucent and ripping easily. SCP-XXXX is partially blind and has a bulbous head that lacks the features of a bovine of which it shares an alleged lineage. SCP-XXXX is sentient and docile, not acknowledging personnel during feeding or cleaning of its cell. SCP-XXXX does not produce excrement.

SCP-XXXX is constantly growing in size and weight. As such, excess mass must be sheared off every week. Testing has shown that limiting the diet of SCP-XXXX does not limit its growth. Additional testing has shown that any meat that has been removed from SCP-XXXX does not display the same constant growth. The meat produced by SCP-XXXX is USDA Utility grade beef and has shown no anomalous properties. Despite this, the resulting meat is to be incinerated as a cautionary measure.

When SCP-XXXX is not sheared of its excess mass new features begin to form, including limbs, genitalia, and, in rare cases, organs. The anatomy and placement of exterior growths are seemingly random. At its largest, SCP-XXXX grew to be 8.5 meters tall and 9.8 meters long featuring seven legs, four stomachs, two penises, five testicles, and three tongues before the Foundation disallowed further growth. Testing was halted after SCP-XXXX began showing evidence of neural tissue generation. 

SCP-XXXX was found in ████████, ███████ Canada on the morning of December 16th, 2004. Calls to animal control were made by multiple residents about a large cow with mange roaming by Highway 17. Two animal control officers were sent to investigate the reports. Upon discovery of SCP-XXXX, the animal control officers contacted the local police department at 9:39. A Foundation plant contacted Site-64 to send containment specialists to transport it. Class A anestics were administered to the animal control officers and the case was closed, reporting it as being a cow with mange that was put down at the scene. 

SCP-XXXX was transported to Site-64 at 12:46 with no resistance from SCP-XXXX. Containment Specialists tracked the origin of SCP-XXXX to a slaughterhouse by the name of Butcher's Block where one employee, Barney Mossman, and the manager, Jeff Fine, were found and taken into Foundation custody. One more employee, Rory Gildson, was later found at his residence at ███ ████ ██████ after calling in sick that day.

All three persons were taken to Site-64 for questioning.

> 
> **Barney Mossman:** Come on man, What am I here for?
> 
> **Interviewer:** Mr. Mossman, I'm sure you've been told, you're in here for questioning about the large bovine creature that allegedly belongs to your employer.
> 
> **Barney Mossman:** You mean Big Charlie?
> 
> **Interviewer:** Is that the name of the bovine or your employer?
> 
> **Barney Mossman:** It's the cow. I didn't choose it, he was already named when I started working there a couple years ago. 
> 
> **Interviewer:** So you don't know the origin of it?
> 
> **Barney Mossman:** No, man I don't know anything.
> 
> **Interviewer:** Anything at all?
> 
> **Barney Mossman:** Well I mean, all I know is that we feed it hay, but it also just eats whatever's around it like wood and bricks, and sometimes the other cows.
> 
> **Interviewer:** How long have you had the creature?
> 
> **Barney Mossman:** I don't know, man, I've been working there for about 4 years and they and already had him when I started working there. They told me to never tell anyone about him, but I don't care enough to tell anyone anyway.
> 
> **Interviewer:** Interesting, so why did you keep it alive and not just slaughter it?
> 
> **Barney Mossman:** Fucking beats me, man, I only ever fed the damned thing, they would never tell me.
> 
> **Interviewer:** Alright. Well is there anything else you can tell me?
> 
> **Barney Mossman:** Nope. I barely ever got to see him, I just sometimes shove hay in his pen. He ain't my department, I'm the custodian.
> 
> **Interviewer:** Okay. So where were you when the thing escaped your employer's possession?
> 
> **Barney Mossman:** I was at home, because it was night. I locked it up good but next morning his pen is empty and I've got you fuckers knocking down the door.
> 
> **Interviewer:** Well alright then, Mr. Mossman, I guess if that's all you can tell us then we're done here.

> 
> **<Begin Log, December 17, 2004, 22:00>**
> 
> **Interviewer:** Your name is Rory Gildson, correct?
> 
> **Rory Gildson:** Yeah.
> 
> **Interviewer:** Okay. Let's start the interview. 
> 
> **Rory Gildson:** Okay.
> 
> **Interviewer:** So what can you tell me about the cow?
> 
> **Rory Gildson:** Well what do you want to know?
> 
> **Interviewer:** Let's start at the beginning; where did the cow come from and how did he come into your possession?
> 
> **Rory Gildson:** We bought a pregnant cow from someone, like two for the price of one, and one day the calf just fell out of the mama cow. Like just ripped through its chest. It didn't have an umbilical cord and it wasn't moving so we thought it was dead. It also looked fucking disgusting. We hauled it out but the next morning it had at some point woken up and tried to get in the barn. We thought "this little guy is fucked, maybe someone will want to buy him for some scientific study or freak show," so we took it inside and posted an ad in the local papers—
> 
> **Interviewer:** Wait, an ad about selling the creature?
> 
> **Rory Gildson:** Yes.
> * ^^,,//Editor's Note: The ad was replaced successfully//,,^^
> **Interviewer:** Okay, continue.
> 
> **Rory Gildson:** What?
> 
> **Interviewer:** Nothing, just continue.
> 
> **Rory Gildson:** Alright. Well we placed the ad but nobody would bite so we decided that it was just a waste to keep it, and it probably wouldn't be a good idea to release it into the wild, as that could fuck up the ecosystem or something, so we decided to finally put it out of it's misery. So we got the cattle gun and we placed it right between its beady fucking eyes and pulled the trigger. There was a "thunk" sound but nothing happened. 
> 
> **Interviewer:** And you're sure the gun wasn't compromised in any way?
> 
> **Rory Gildson:** Yeah. And when we tried it again but it just ended up shattering the gun. So we decided to try slitting its throat and leaving it there but it barely bled. So next we tried just completely cutting out it's throat but it still didn't seem to affect him at all. We decided to try and butcher it right there where it stood but it didn't even react. When we were done he was practically a skeleton. We realized that we could try just selling the meat. 
> 
> **Interviewer:** How did you know that the meat wasn't toxic or something?
> 
> **Rory Gildson:** We didn't. But it's because we just wanted to make something out of our purchase. A couple days later we realized that he had grown back most of what we cut off him. We then tried feeding it to Barney and he didn't even notice it tasting different. It was like our miracle cow. One cow that just eats anything in front of it and produces infinite meat. Of course we still have other cows but they don't like Big Charlie. If they get too close and Charlie gets too hungry, he'll eat them, but we don't really care, he'll produce enough meat to cover both of them. 
> 
> **Interviewer:** Fascinating. Is there anything else you can tell me?
> 
> **Rory Gildson:** He's sterile.
> 
> **Interviewer:** Okay. Is there anything else?
> 
> **Rory Gildson:** Well not really, that's all there is to say.
> 
> **Interviewer:** Do you have any idea how it escaped your possession?
> 
> **Rory Gildson:** What? No, I was sick at home. I have no idea.
> 
> **Interviewer:** Alright then. Thank you for cooperating, I believe we're done here.

> **Interviewer:** You are Jeff Fine, is that correct?
> 
> **Jeff Fine:** Yes. It is.
> 
> **Interviewer:** And you are the owner of the Butcher's Block slaughterhouse?
> 
> **Jeff Fine:** Yes.
> 
> **Interviewer:** The business that your employees claim housed and fed the bovine creaute?
> 
> **Jeff Fine:** Yes.
> 
> **Interviewer:** Can you tell us more about that?
> 
> **Jeff Fine:** I bought a pregnant cow from some guy. Eventually it gave birth. And that was Big Charlie.
> 
> **Interviewer:** I know about the birth and the way you would shear the flesh off of it. Is there anything else you could tell me?
> 
> **Jeff Fine:** We tried to sell it thinking someone ought to want it to study or something but nobody would touch him. I told the boys to put him down but the cattle gun wouldn't even crack his skull. So they tried just cutting him up where he stood. The next couple of days while we were waiting for him to die we noticed that he had regrown himself so we decided to accept this blessing.
> 
> **Interviewer:** How long have you been selling the meat?
> 
> **Jeff Fine:** 9 years, for as long as he's been alive.
> 
> **Interviewer:** It's 9 years old?

> **Interviewer:** To who, when, and where?

> **Interviewer:** Mr. Fine, answer the question.
> 
> **Jeff Fine:** To Big Charlie. 
> 
> **Interviewer:** Oh?
> 
> **Jeff Fine:** I've done it every night since we received him.
> 
> **Interviewer:** And why is that?
> 
> **Jeff Fine:** You heard what they said! He feels no pain, you can't kill him, he provides for us! He is our savior! 
> 
> **Interviewer:** How would you pray to him?
> 
> **Jeff Fine:** Well I would open his pen, kneel down in front of him and ask to receive his blessings. 
> 
> **Interviewer:** And so this time it ran past you and escaped?
> 
> **Jeff Fine:** Yes.
> 
> **Interviewer:** Had he ever shown signs of that kind of behavior before?
> 
> **Jeff Fine:** No, not at all. I don't know why he would do that but it has to be for a reason.
> 
> **Interviewer:** And has this prayer to it ever worked for you?

It is currently not believed that Jeff Fine's worshiping of SCP-XXXX is due to any anomalous effect, as is suggested by a study of personnel showing no abnormal religious or ritual practices after working with SCP-XXXX.

At this time there seems to be no reason to discredit any of the claims made. The workers and cows that were in the possession of the Butcher's Block Slaughterhouse at the time were all administrated class E amnestics. The Butcher's Block Slaughterhouse was closed under the pretense that it was due to a health code violation and the employees were arrested for malpractice. 

The identity of man that sold Jeff Fine the pregnant that birthed SCP-XXXX is still unknown.
