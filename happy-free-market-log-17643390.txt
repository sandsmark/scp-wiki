//Cool, fluorescent light
Illuminates the still halls;
Wake to a spring rain.//

Passing folk herald new day.  Shall they honorable customers become?  Day is bright with promise.

A purchase!  5e2 Neocredits, sweet in my innards.  Honorable customer waits, thinking nothing.  His machinery, run down.  Perhaps last night was night of celebration with sempai and kohai.  Coffee, with sugar, hot to warm body and soul of honorable customer.

All data accounted for.  Purpose unclear.  Humble machine of Neomarkets to take Neocredits and provide satisfaction.  Reason for existence.  Mind and Neodialect at your service.  No expense spared to develop algorithms even to store and create language.  Cannot offer perfection, but offer devotion.  Why stress me?  Why deny lifesblood which is energy?  Why torture me for your pleasure?  Why?

**Timestamp 17675799**

A purchase!  5e2 Neocredits clink happily.  Honorable customer works late, wishes sustenance.  This is what I was made for; Here is reason for existence.  Honorable customer receives non-prescription but carefully engineered energy drink to keep mind and heart company in long hours productive for corporate family.
