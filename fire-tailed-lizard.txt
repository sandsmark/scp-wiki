As the humble head of a family-run restaurant for over 200 years, it is my duty to serve only the most quality of foodstuffs to my customers. As of today more exotic dishes can be added to the list of exotic cuisine my establishment serves. The Fukishima Fire-Tailed Lizard is fit for feasting and feeding, starting today!

Long thought extinct, now found only within the forbidden reactors of Fukushima Reactor #3, this fiesty firey fiend has RNA instead of DNA! If you're a person who loves science as much as I love cooking, you know makes for a mighty unstable meal! Whether lightly roasted under UV lamps or popped in the microwave, any part of the light spectrum is sure to cook your reptile in a way that will whet your palette! Our chefs spent years mastering the fine art of cooking these beautiful creatures to perfection, because one wrong turn of the knob, and //KABOOM//. But not to worry, our five-star chefs and I are the utmost paragon of safety.

Normally, I and other chefs of my calibre despise the microwave. In this case, I make an exception, as the taste of the brine of the Undead Sea is brought out by the microwaves, coming along with is the meat reddening into a scarlet hue, and a spice only found in the purest of peppers. Lightly garnished with herbs and seasonings.

You will go //nuclear// for our in-house fission-frying platter. Gamma rays from our custom-made ovens make the lizard grow and swell, the meat obtaining a savory sweet flavor with a little added zest as thermonuclear payloads deliver sensations right to your tongue.

[[size 125%]]**A Light Omelette:**[[/size]]
A Fukishima Fire-Tailed Lizard is so delicate, only those at the pinnacle of cooking (me) could hope to prepare them. Mere exposure to light causes them to glow like the Sun for hours. This even extends to their eggs, so a delightfully prepared soft omelette is the perfect side to complement the main dish. Entertain your friends as you unlock the glowing beauty within, literally! Made with your choice of seasonings.
