**Item #:** SCP-XXXX

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-XXXX is to be held in a standard humanoid containment chamber. Furnished with a bed and several children toys, and standard rations will be provide daily. Personnel may only view SCP-XXXX through video surveillance, and interaction is to be avoided at all times. SCP-XXXX is to be immediately tranquilized upon any signs of delight or happiness. 

All instances of SCP-XXXX-2 created are to be euthanized and cremated immediately after testing.

**Item Description:** SCP-XXXX is a Caucasian human male of approximately 1.1 meters in height. It appears to be of seven to eight years in age, and has proven docile and cooperative when provided with its necessities. Communication has proven ineffective, as it displays no sapience. SCP-XXXX will only recognize any human visible to it as its "Mommy" or "Daddy", depending on their gender. It will then attempt to approach them, until they are within its range of effect.

SCP-XXXX's main anomalous effect acts on any human within 4 meters of distance, though it can only target individuals if they are in its visual range; Any physical barriers preventing interaction with targeted subject(s) will prevent SCP-XXXX's anomalous effect. Upon entering its proximity, SCP-XXXX will immediately display excitement and will attempt to make physical contact with the subject. Any obstacles preventing SCP-XXXX from doing so will cause it to react in disappointment.

When any living human comes into contact with SCP-XXXX, all components of their skeletal, muscle, and epidermal system will be affected, turning the subject into SCP-XXXX-2. The following is the list of effects on SCP-XXXX-2:
* X-rays have shown that bones will become deficient in proteins, similar to an accelerated state of Osteoporosis, and will eventually degenerate completely.
* The muscles of SCP-XXXX-2 will increase in mass and size and become flaccid. Muscles will continue to grow in mass until the formation of a cubical enclosure around SCP-XXXX-2. 
* All limbs of SCP-XXXX-2 will recede into the torso, and all other organs not present in the skull will be incorporated into muscles. SCP-XXXX-2 will resemble a cube consisting of flesh, approximately the height of the subject's original form.

SCP-XXXX will then proceed to shape SCP-XXXX-2 to resemble organisms from the kingdom //Animalia//. Recently logged creations include a tiger, a frog, and an octopus. Methods utilized by SCP-XXXX include repeatedly slamming its head onto SCP-XXXX-2, kicking or striking with its limbs to create depressions, biting and pulling at SCP-XXXX-2 to form "limbs" or to tear off unneeded material, and muttering into SCP-XXXX-2's ear.

SCP-XXXX will eventually stop activity, allowing SCP-XXXX-2's muscles to solidify and preventing further change to its structure. The epidermis will change in shade, corresponding to the animal SCP-XXXX-2 was made to resemble. They will display enthusiastic behavior and servility towards SCP-XXXX, though vocal communication has not been recorded. SCP-XXXX will then appear to inspect SCP-XXXX-2, and will often react with disgust or distress. It will feign ignorance of its presence, despite persistent actions by SCP-XXXX-2 to please it.

**Addendum XXXX-C:** SCP-XXXX was recovered from an upstate mansion in ████████, ███████. Three instances of SCP-XXXX-2 were also found in the house. A crude handwritten note was found in the third story bedroom, assumed to be produced by SCP-XXXX.
