 **Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4420 is situated in a secure position in the Site-82 Arboretum. Tentative Containment Module #819 regulates the entrance to an artificial pocket dimension large enough to confine SCP-4420. Containment technicians have installed four synchronized Scranton–Marlowe Topology Stabilizers, which maintain dimensional stability inside the module.

**Description:** SCP-4420 is a red Idaho potato with a current mass of 400 million kg and external dimensions of 150 metres by 65 metres by 55 metres. SCP-4420 displays the following ectoentropic properties:

# SCP-4420 responds to moisture shrinkage (~5% every two weeks) by generating a new amount of moist potato matter. During this event, a random Idaho citizen's drinking water transforms into starch-rich potato-flavoured water, which grants the ability to commune with potatoes for 3 to 10 hr after consumption.
# Exposure to electromagnetic radiation in the human visual spectrum (λ = 400 nm to 700 nm) produces potato matter of a randomized form. This matter relates to potatoes at various conceptual levels, be that immediate or vague. The new matter grows alongside SCP-4420 and attaches itself via esoteric means beyond current agricultural understanding. Observed forms include:
 * Any variation of the 5 000 potato varieties grown globally.
 * Types of cooked potatoes such as mashed potatoes, French fries, and potato chips.
 * 1996 Idaho County Junior League Potato Sack Race champion Michelle Brown, age 6.
 * A species of Jerusalem cricket (colloquially known as the potato bug) composed of sweet potato. These insects have infested ~8% of SCP-4420 to date.
 * Memetic ennui affecting 10% of persons within a 5-km radius.
# SCP-4420 displays evident immunity to decay. SCP-4420 consumes most organic irregularities almost immediately after their growth, and produces healthy potato matter in their place.
# [[span style="margin: 0;"]]SCP-4420 consumes food and organic waste within 20 metres of its surface. Any nearby organic material transforms into a potato tuber of equal mass and teleports into SCP-4420. This includes small animals up to 5 kg in mass.[[/span]]

As of current documentation, SCP-4420 has been growing for 22 years.

**I. 10 May 2019**

Field researchers discovered foreign fluid with trace amounts of thaumic contaminants in the local groundwater. The Site-82 Operations Command Office initiated [[[scp-3731|Mandate 3731-Ov91]]], which calls for immediate lockdown and destruction of foreign substances. Security staff considered the lockdown successful within the hour.

Because of its containment location, however, SCP-4420 remained unaccounted for.

At 21:51 CDT, SCP-4420 absorbed thaumic fluids and developed sapience lasting for 32 hours. During this time, it displayed the ability to manipulate informational constructs. SCP-4420 then disseminated 362 SMS messages to on-site staff.

A series of received messages is as follows.

SCP-4420 has been reclassified as NEUTRALIZED.
