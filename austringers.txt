> //Phineas looked at the old photo on the wall, near the dining room table of his apartment. It depicted a young man with a meticulously trimmed beard dressed in a ragged flannel, his arm around an even younger man with dark green eyes, and long black hair tied back in a ponytail. The men in the photo had ear to ear grins. Their troubles had not yet come to pass.//

> //"I have never doubted anything more in my life, 45," he said with a sad grin.//

> //"Phineas," the old woman said softly, "Vince tried to kill you. The kind young man you knew has finally died. What stands in his place is nothing short of a monster."//

However, in my 15 years of service I can safely say that Vincent Anderson has effectively become a tumor on his own company. If he is not stopped soon, his toxicity will metastasize and destroy everything you helped build."//

> //Phineas nodded. He sighed and reached for his phone, then carefully typed in a text message and sent it to a Foundation Agent named Sasha Merlo://
> 
> //**I know how you get him.**//
> 
> //Phineas placed the phone back down on the table and looked back up at the picture on his wall.//
> 
> //"Well," he said with a melancholic chuckle, "here goes nothing."//
