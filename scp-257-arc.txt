**Item #:** SCP-257-ARC

    **Object Class:** Keter -- Neutralized

    **Special Containment Procedures:**

        [DATA EXPUNGED]

        [UPDATE]: SCP-257-ARC no longer requires special containment protocols. SCP-257-ARC has been sealed inside a 2 foot wide solid plastic cube and placed in secure storage awaiting disposal via [[[SCP-101]]].

    **Description:**

       [DATA EXPUNGED]

       [UPDATE]: SCP-257-ARC appears to be a several year old human sized skull, with the addition of a pair of horns and writing on the more flat surfaces. The horns are in the middle of the parietal, off to either side of the skull. They are almost perfectly smooth, and despite the actual shape of the horns being simple crescent moon shape, all people viewing SCP-257-ARC in person or via picture ascribe them as looking humorous, while the exact same shape in any other material or picture draws no reaction.
 
       The writing on the skull, covering most of the frontal, parietal, occipital, sphenoid, maxilla, and mandible sections, is clearly legible, etched into the skull with near laser precision. The words are easily readable, and seem to exist in English, French, German, Latin, and Chinese simultaneously. The messages written all seem to be curses and wishes of dark intent towards the reader of the words, though the vocabulary, grammar, and syntax are juvenile at best. The messages reference hell, demons, and the writer being tricked quite often.
