title:SCP-2000: Anomalous Transmission, 2485 MHz
**Item #:** SCP-2000

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** The Foundation has modified radio frequency and electronics manufacturing standards worldwide to avoid civilian production of devices capable of receiving SCP-2000.  Internet, radio, and print communications monitoring efforts by relevant Foundation departments are to be on alert for images or descriptions relating to SCP-2000. Additionally, personnel and D-class are to be exposed to the signal associated with SCP-2000 in order to determine eligibility for Project Rosetta and permanent assignment to SCP-2000; no other method has thus far been developed of determining the presence of a functional Rosetta cluster in humans.

The frequency on which SCP-2000 is broadcast is to be monitored regularly for any change in SCP-2000 content. Additionally, individuals determined to be Rosetta-positive are to be exposed to SCP-2000 for at least twelve hours of every day, followed by debriefing to gather more intelligence regarding SCP-2000 and the species responsible for its generation. All extraterrestrial vessels and probes are to be modified covertly to include equipment designed to monitor for the presence of SCP-2000 off-world. Research to determine more information regarding the source of SCP-2000 and further background behind its content is to continue as a Class 2 priority effort.

**Description:** SCP-2000 is an electromagnetic signal with a constant frequency of 2485 MHz. --Its power and origin cannot be determined; the signal appears to be invariably present at all locations throughout the known solar system.-- The signal seems to lack a single point of origin; rather, current analysis suggests SCP-2000 is being broadcast with a power of 1.86 mW, which in combination with the large coverage area of SCP-2000 suggests that the signal is being broadcast in a fashion that transcends 4-dimensional space, emerging into conventional space in a three-dimensional grid pattern with transmission points spaced approximately three meters apart. As the signal has been found to be ubiquitous by every receiver capable of detecting it both on- and off-Earth, it is presently believed that SCP-2000 may be broadcasting throughout the universe simultaneously.

The signal was believed initially to be an anomalous but innocuous white noise present at that frequency; minor variances suggested the presence of some other information within the signal, but no means to decode SCP-2000 were developed until 2011, and more complete methods of determining SCP-2000's full content have been developed since.

The signal was found to contain a digital video transmission with a monaural track. The video appears to depict a humanoid entity of an unknown species floating in a dark room; while no context is provided for the image, the reflexive body language and high-pitched noises being emitted by the entity seem to suggest it is in extreme physical distress. No other entities have been seen within the video feed and no external source of harm has been noted. However, certain features within the image suggest that some sort of abnormal telekinetic phenomena are occurring; the entity frequently appears to be pushed or moved, and brief images of background objects within the room suggest that some gravitational field is present, implying the entity's midair position is not due to zero-gravity conditions and the entity is being held in place by an unknown force. 

In addition to the video and audio tracks, an additional component of the signal is perceivable only by individuals possessing a specific abnormal nerve bundle connecting Brodmann areas 41 and 42 to the dorsal amygdala in the temporal lobe of the brain. Individuals possessing the nerve bundle report hearing an unusual high-pitched sound alongside the monaural audio of SCP-2000, then begin experiencing a form of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy characterized by complex partial seizures. During seizures, affected individuals begin speaking in a form of glossolalia, speaking near-constantly without any apparent meaning. The seizures will continue as long as the individual is exposed to the SCP-2000 audio track; the glossolalia will develop over time into a more coherent messages. The nerve bundle has been nicknamed the "Rosetta cluster" by Foundation Medical's research division, due to the ability of individuals in possession of it to "translate" the signal's otherwise indecipherable components. Both individuals thus far found to be in possession of the Rosetta cluster have retained some memories from their experiences.

**Addendum 2000-A:** Debriefings of Rosetta-positive personnel after initial exposure to SCP-2000

> 
> **Agent Nissentra:** Could you describe your experience with SCP-2000?
> 
> **D-099238:** They brought me in to clean the room. One guy, a researcher, I guess, sitting and watching TV. I didn't know what he was watching, figured it was some weird shit, didn't pay much attention to it. Wasn't my first time, you know? I had just started sweeping when I got this hot feeling, like a fever. I sort of felt myself falling, but I didn't feel the ground.
> 
> **Nissentra:** What did you experience during your seizure?
> 
> **099238:** They told me it was a seizure afterward. It was more like one of those dreams you have when you're a kid, you know? When you're really sick, and they give you NyQuil or something. It was like real life, but everything was just huge all around me. I can't remember a lot of details.
> 
> **Nissentra:** During your episode, you repeated certain phrases several times. May I ask if you recall any of them in particular?
> 
> **099238** You can, sure, but I doubt I can help.
> 
> **Nissentra:** During moments when the SCP-2000 entity was silent, you were heard to say "All glory Adidal, all glory Adidal" somewhat quietly several times. What does --"
> 
> **099238:** (slurring) All glory Adidal. All power. All fall before Adidal. All light bends. All sound spreads. All glory.
> 
> //A pause.//
> 
> **099238:** I remember some of what it was. It wasn't like seeing or hearing so much. It was just feeling. I felt something large, so, so large. Above me. All around me. It was looking at the universe with a sort of...it was this, this feeling...like when you have plants inside on a windowsill, yeah? And you see them growing, and you feel like you have a part in it, but it's just so //beneath// you. So small. It was the way you feel when you're a kid and you do something cute and you watch your dad smile at you.
> 
> //The subject was silent for several minutes.//
> 
> **099238:** And then I heard the screaming, the sound they told me was coming from the TV. It was loud, so loud in my head. 
> 
> **Nissentra:** Could you understand what the creature was saying?
> 
> **099238:** Ruhar.
> 
> **Nissentra:** Excuse me?
> 
> //The subject's eyes unfocused. The subject's voice became slurred.//
> 
> **099238:** The accursed was known as Ruhar before its crime. It knows no sound but screams.
> 
> //D-099238 experienced nasal hemorrhage and lost consciousness at this point.//

//Note: D-398398's Rosetta cluster was noted as being slightly more developed than that of D-099238.//

> **Agent Nissentra:** Could you describe your experience with SCP-2000?
> 
> **D-398398:** I was brought in as part of a, a focus group, I guess? They brought all the D-class from our site in in groups of ten. Reminded me of the line-up. They turned on a TV and showed us what was going on.
> 
> **Nissentra:** How did you react to the images on the TV?
> 
> **D-398398:** It was like I got drunk all at once, super fast. I felt myself falling to the ground, and then it was...
> 
> //[pause]//
> 
> **398398:** It wasn't like anything, but if you had to put it...it was like if you went to a 3D movie in Japanese or something, something where you don't speak the language, but it has this perfect surround sound, and you can feel and smell and taste it, too. That's what I was seeing. But everyone else, everyone looking at the TV? What they're seeing is like if you shot that movie with a camcorder and played it on a TV, and then shot the TV with a cell phone camera. Everyone else looked at the TV and saw the cell phone video, and I think I was the only one who was following the plot. I was the only one who could see the subtitles.
> 
> **Nissentra:** What is the plot? What were you seeing?
> 
> **398398:** It's...I could tell that I wasn't seeing it the way one of //them// would see it, but I understood it in some of the terms we would use. I saw this movie about this guy, this bigshot guy, like a Capone. A shot-caller, somebody with that kind of power where you can't even imagine how far he can reach. I keep calling it a he, but I don't think they got men and women like we do. And along comes this other guy in the neighborhood. If the first guy's like a Capone, this is somebody who wants to be Bugs Moran, right? Challenge the big man on the block, prove he ain't all he says he is. But this wannabe guy, he knows he'd be crazy going after the Capone guy himself, right? So he goes after the guy's family. Hopes to send a message.
> 
> **Nissentra:** What did he do?
> 
> **398398:** That part...it got sort of fuzzy. I don't think we have an idea in any language we have for what these people can do to each other when they want somebody else to be hurt the way this guy did it. It wasn't just physical, and it wasn't just psychological. I don't even think it fits in space and time the way we understand it. But this guy goes after Capone's...let's say //wife//, and maybe whatever they have instead of kids too. And this Capone -- I can't remember his name --
> 
> **Nissentra:** Was it "Adidal"?
> 
> **398398:** Adidal knows all and sees all. All praise to Adidal that knows us. All praise to Adidal that sees us. All glory.
> 
> //Subject pauses. Subject's head begins to sag, but lifts up. A small trickle of blood drips from the subject's nose.//
> 
> **398398:** I'm sorry, it comes over me sometimes. I don't think it leaves you once you see it. But anyway, the Ad...the Capone guy, he decides he wants to send a message of his own. Only not to one person. He's gonna keep this poor bastard alive and suffering forever, and right out in public. No legends, no word of mouth. He wants the evidence available for anyone to see, anyone who even thinks about going up against him.
> 
> **Nissentra:** Do you have any information about "Ruhar"?
> 
> **398398:** The accursed was known as Ruhar before its crime. It knows no sound but screams.
> 
> //Subject's breathing intensifies, but subject remains conscious. The blood coming from the subject's nose intensifies.//
> 
> **Nissentra:** Can you elaborate at all? Is Ruhar the individual in the transmission?
> 
> **398398:** The accursed was known as Ruhar before its crime. Eternal shall be its suffering. It shall suffer when all light in the cosmos grows dark. It shall suffer when all life in this cosmos lies dead. It shall suffer when all time in this cosmos runs down. Its suffering will be true when there is no truth it--

> //The subject loses consciousness.//
