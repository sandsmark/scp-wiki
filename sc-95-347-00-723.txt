**DeCIRO Catalogue Number:** SC-95/347-00/723

**Document Type:** Step Compilation

**Dates Received:** 05-12-1995 through 06-15-2000

**Operation Status:** Open

**Foreword:** All sprung from chaos and all shalt return unto chaos. A body unable to return to chaos -- That is the wicked Foundation's doing, whose tyranny is deeply-rooted upon corpses. It screams in silence in its bondage unto a shaky Foundation, instead we of Delta Command wish to hear the swan song of the body and all worlds. Operation Asclepius will heal the undying and castrate Hades. From the husk of the undying corpse, a great race will spring forth and reach throughout all spacetime. The swan song, entropy, Insurgency -- All will spread across all spacetime and forever tarnish the stale order of Hades' dominion. 

Hereafter we of Delta Command document the Steps of the Plan as transcribed by the Engineer of the Chaos Insurgency.

**1. STEP 95/347**

The Alpha will confirm identity of the Beta via the phrase "All sprung from chaos". If response is "and entropy is existence supreme", present document CO-98/347 to the Beta. Otherwise, leave at once.

We wish to have it recovered for the Plan. Exploiting your position in the Foundation, submit requests to have it transferred to Foundation Area-4, where you are currently stationed at. Once approved, report to Delta Command. Ensure that transportation is conducted by flight and be present during transportation. Commandeer the transport while at flight. When confirmed, report to Delta Command.

Foundation security operatives from Foundation Area-4 are known to frequent the La Costena Bar on Main St. of Los Angeles, California every Thursday night from 2200 hours local time onwards. On the night of 3rd October of the current year, one Gamma-class personnel and three Beta-class personnel are to intercept a Foundation operative, Agent Jonathan Barker. 

Take 3.0 mL of his saliva while he is alive, and he can be killed afterwards. Put the body inside the Pouch of Saint Nicholas. The Gamma is to mix the saliva taken with the vial of Protean Juice, stir for ten seconds and ingest the mixture. Hereafter, Agent Barker sides with the Insurgency as a Gamma-class operative. He can also take the Pouch of Saint Nicholas with him. 

Betas may leave to report to Delta Command of the operation's status. Barker will return to his current assignment. 

**5. STEP 96/795**

**6. STEP 96/803**

Agent Barker will deliver the genetic sample acquired to Base GN for storage. Label it "pegasus".

> 
> **Summary Report:** First patch of pegasi is born. Ten in strength. Physiology is stable. 

**11. STEP 99/1056**

Introduce the pegasi to the Tachyon Chamber. Acclimatise them. If any of the pegasi die, replace them. Also, conduct weights training for living specimens. Ensure the adults are capable of flight even when saddled with a mass equivalent to that of an adult human. 

**12. STEP 00/7**

An Alpha-class operative working at a corn field in Yorkshire is to be inscribe Glyph EH-54 onto the corn field via a harvester at night. Contact reporters from //The Sun// about the glyphs on the next day. Claim ignorance and insist it is the work of extraterrestrials. 

**13. STEP 00/14**

The envoy for the Eternal Horde is expected to arrive at Base GN. When he comes, allow him to inspect the pegasi. He can take at most one adult pegasus capable of being ridden on with him, if he wishes to. If he wants more than one pegasus, politely reject him and refer him to Delta Command. Do not harm him. 

**14. STEP 00/17**

**19. STEP 00/723**

Delta Command has noted the slow progress of the interbreeding program. Therefore, introduce the Blight of Chiang Mai to the Eternal Horde horse and pegasus used for interbreeding. 

As backup, extract genetic samples from the other Eternal Horde horses for genome modification.
