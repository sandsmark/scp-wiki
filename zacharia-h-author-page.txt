**__Detail:__** Agent "Zacharia H" is employed as a semi-autonomous operative in the Foundation Intelligence Agency (FIA) and is the current assistant to the chief of liasons for the southern African regional division of the Department of External Affairs (DEA).

The agent's primary directive is the investigation of anomalous phenomena in response to media watchdog alerts, and the subsequent documentation of contained phenomena. While typically a first responder in his capacity as a covert operative, the agent has been called on to conduct forensic investigations after clearing of potentially high-risk anomalous hazards by specialised response teams.

Agent "H" answers to FIA coordinators at Site-151 [[footnote]]Refer to Secure Facility Dossier: Site-151 for additional information.[[/footnote]], to which he reports in person following the initial containment of an SCP item with which he has been involved. He has been highly active in the field since his recruitment and has a Cartwright clearance rate [[footnote]]Ratio of total reports of distinct anomalies to total distinct anomalous items contained as a result of said investigations. Used as a rough grade of overall competency for FIA operatives.[[/footnote]] of approximately 60%.
