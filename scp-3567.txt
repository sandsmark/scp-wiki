**Item #:** SCP-3567 
 
**Object Class:** Safe 


[[include :scp-sandbox-3:image-zoom name=https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5107/5614355678_2d7856ceea_b.jpg|caption=Detail of the "bubbles" present on SCP-3567|width=300px|align=right]]

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3567 is currently contained within Site 19. The object is stored flat on a plastic tray in a locked case with the bubbled side facing up. SCP-3567 is not to be stored within 6m of any other SCP object or vital instrumentation, and a 6m exclusion zone should be indicated in any testing or containment zones to prevent personnel from entering into SCP-3567's area of effect.

Access to SCP-3567 requires special authorization from the Head Researcher and is available only to those already granted Level 2 clearance. Direct interaction with SCP-3567 is allowed only in emergency situations. Research-specific interaction with SCP-3567 is to be facilitated through the use of a remotely controlled drone or robotic implement.

Any subject affected by SCP-3567 is to be designated as an instance of SCP-3567-1. SCP-3567-1 instances that appear in the current timeline should be immediately sedated and transferred to a humanoid containment cell within Site 19 to be evaluated for interrogational value. Afterwards, subjects should be amnesticized and kept sedated to prevent any information breaches. 

For a list of SCP-3567-1 instances, reference document 3567.doc.01.

++++ UPDATE TO CONTAINMENT AND TESTING PROCEDURES 

In an effort to conserve the limited testing resources, no further testing of SCP-3567 is permitted until such a time as the anomalous effects of SCP-3567 can be quantified and the trajectory of SCP-3567's temporal displacement can be modeled. Approval from the Head Researcher or those granted Level 4/3567 clearance is required to test hypothesized methods of quantifying and modeling the effects of SCP-3567.

----
**Description:** SCP-3567 is a standard 30cm x 30cm sheet of Bubble Wrap and the field of temporal effect produced by the object upon activation.

The object contains 1,764 6mm diameter plastic hemispheres filled with an unknown, undetectable substance.  --At the time of containment, 1,204 bubbles remain unruptured.-- The current number of remaining unruptured bubbles is 905.

SCP-3567 is activated instantaneously when a bubble is ruptured. Upon activation a spherical area of temporal effect with a 5m radius centered on the ruptured bubble is generated. This activation is accompanied by a rush of air and a popping sound generally in the range of 80-100dB.

SCP-3567 has only been observed to affect sapient subjects. Subjects affected by SCP-3567 switch physical and temporal locations with a version of themselves from 50 years into the future. Those affected by SCP-3567 return to their temporal place of origin after 50 days. Present and Future Subjects are immediately swapped upon termination of the causal loop.

It has not been determined whether this is the future of our own timeline or another, although the well preserved state of future subjects implies that SCP-3567 may target futures in which a whole entity can be retrieved. 

The effects of SCP-3567 appear to be cumulative when activations occur simultaneously.

**Discovery:** SCP-3567 was originally retrieved from law enforcement in Pittsburgh, PA on 10/06/2009.  


[[include :scp-sandbox-3:image-zoom name=https://live.staticflickr.com/68/187943195_5cf5fd0e38_k.jpg|caption=201 Garden St|width=300px|align=right]]


At 12:43 PM on 16/05/2009, emergency dispatch received a call about gunshots at 201 Garden St. It is likely that the sound heard by the caller was the loud popping sound that accompanies activation of the SCP. It is assumed that multiple bubbles of SCP-3567 were ruptured and the immediate vicinity experienced multiple activations of the object's temporal effect. 

Upon the arrival of emergency services, a desiccated corpse (later designated SCP-3567-1-B) was discovered along with a pile of discarded clothing and a cardboard box addressed to Layla Johnson. The cardboard box was retrieved by local law enforcement and opened for inspection. The box contained a consumer cellular phone wrapped in a sheet of bubble wrap. After examination of the package by investigators, it was delivered as addressed. SCP-3567-1-B was transported to the local medical examiner for autopsy. 

At approximately 6:15 pm, SCP-3567 was activated again by the recipient’s juvenile son, Ryan Johnson (designated SCP-3567-1-C). The temporal effects were observed by Layla Johnson, and emergency services were contacted immediately. Upon activation of the object, SCP-3567-1-C disappeared, leaving behind his clothing. A nude elderly male (SCP-3567-1-D) appeared standing where SCP-3567-1-C had disappeared.  

SCP-3567-1-D was taken into custody for questioning by local law enforcement.  

The local medical examiner’s office contacted the CDC for a consultation on SCP-3567-1-B. After a CDC representative arrived and assessed the body, the Foundation was notified via standard channels. The Foundation arrived on site and took custody of all related items and subjects. 

Layla Johnson was administered a Class-B amnestic and a cover story was provided as to the disappearance of her son. It is unclear whether the receipt of SCP-3567 was intended to harm the recipient or if it was included in the shipment by mistake. 

SCP-3567-1-B was recovered from the CDC and showed desiccation and preservation consistent with that of mummified corpses.  

SCP-3567-1-D was taken into Foundation custody for monitoring and interview.

= **SCP-3567-1 Instances**
----
**SCP-3567-1-A:** SCP-3567-1-A was a delivery driver and the first subject known to be affected by SCP-3567. It is presumed that the subject has been transported approximately 25,000 years into the future. Location of Subject SCP-3567-1-A is currently a low level priority. If not already in foundation custody, location of Subject SCP-3567-1-A must be made a high level priority as of 16/05/2084. 
----
**SCP-3567-1-B:** SCP-3567-1-B appears to be the desiccated corpse of SCP-3567-1-A. Radiocarbon dating of tissue samples taken from SCP-3567-1-B determines an approximate age of 25,000 years. SCP-3567-1-B is currently held in Foundation custody. DNA testing shows a near perfect match with SCP-3567-1-A. 
----
**SCP-3567-1-C:** SCP-3567-1-C is Ryan Johnson, aged 7 at the time of entry into Foundation custody on 05/07/2009. SCP-3567-1-C has been released into foster care after amnesticization. Careful monitoring of the subject's mental and physical health must be maintained. 

Until it can be determined that SCP-3567-1-C and SCP-3567-1-D are the same subject, they should be designated separately. In the event that it is determined that SCP-3567-1-C and SCP-3567-1-D are the same subject, subject should be retrieved and held for interview. 
----
**SCP-3567-1-D:** SCP-3567-1-D is Samuel Preston, aged 57 at the time of entry into Foundation custody on 10/06/2009. On 05/07/2009 SCP-3567-1-D disappeared from Foundation custody and was replaced with SCP-3567-1-C. Per Experiment Log, SCP-3567-1-D is confirmed to be in future Foundation custody. DNA testing shows a near perfect match with SCP-3567-1-C.

**Interviewed:** SCP-3567-1-D

**Interviewer:** Dr. Michael Simmons 

**Foreword:** SCP-3567-1-D was discovered nude in the home of Layla Johnson. The subject has been told that he is being held for psychiatric evaluation at a state run facility.

**<Begin Log, 9:13 AM, 06/12/2009>**

**Dr. Simmons:** Hello, I’m Dr. Simmons, we’ll begin the interview now. Could you state your name and age for the record?    

**SCP-3567-1-D:** My name is Samuel Charles Preston, and I’m 57 years old. Where am I? 

**Dr. Simmons:** Mr. Preston, as was previously explained, you are at a psychiatric care facility undergoing evaluation. As such we need to get a good idea of your mental state, so I’m going to ask you some questions that will seem very simple, understood?  

//<Subject nods his head in agreement>//

**Dr. Simmons:** Good. Mr. Preston, do you know what year it is? 

**SCP-3567-1-D:** It’s 2059. 

**Dr. Simmons:** Alright. And who is the president, Mr. Preston? 

[Portion of interview redacted to prevent retrocausal anomaly]

**Dr. Simmons:** Mr. Preston, do you remember any particular events from your childhood? Particularly around the time you were in elementary school. 

**SCP-3567-1-D:** You know, I can’t really recall. I think the earliest memory I have is waking up in the hospital after my fever. 

**Dr. Simmons:** Interesting, Mr. Preston. And what age were you at the time? 

**SCP-3567-1-D:** 15. No, 16. I think. It was winter, right around my 16th birthday. 

**Dr. Simmons:** So there’s a potential history of memory issues. Do you know what kind of fever this was, Mr. Smith? 

**SCP-3567-1-D:** No, they always just referred to it as “the fever”. 

-- Portion of interview excluded for brevity -- 

**SCP-3567-1-D:** I don’t remember my mother. I know my father died when I was young, and the home I was put in after the hospital told me that my mother abandoned me. What does this have to do with anything? 

**Dr. Simmons:** Mr. Preston, we’re just trying to get a background on you so that we can better understand the episode that led to you nude in that home. 

**SCP-3567-1-D:** Doctor, that home was so familiar! Where was that? 

**Dr. Simmons:** I don’t think that it’s wise to provide you with any information regarding that home. It seems that you may have been staying there for a while. We wouldn’t want to trigger another episode. 

-- Remainder of interview excluded for brevity -- 

**<End Log, 12:17 PM, 06/12/2009>**

**Closing Statement:** SCP-3567-1-D became increasingly uncooperative after mention of 201 Garden St. Subject was sedated and returned to the holding cell.

**Interviewed:** SCP-3567-1-C 

**Interviewer:** Dr. Michael Simmons 

**Foreword:** During a routine check of SCP-3567-1-D's containment cell, SCP-3567-1-C was found nude in the containment cell. The subject was interviewed shortly after security personnel determined that the subject was likely Ryan Johnson, who had disappeared from 201 Garden St on 05/16/2009. 

**<Begin Log, 1:07 PM, 07/05/2009>**

**Dr. Simmons:** Hello, I’m Dr. Simmons, we’ll begin the interview now. For the record, what’s your name? First name and last name, please.

**SCP-3567-1-C:** Ryan. Oh, Ryan Johnson.  

**Dr. Simmons:** It’s nice to meet you, Ryan. Can you tell me how old you are?  

**SCP-3567-1-C:** I'm 7 years old. 

**Dr. Simmons:** We’re going to talk about where you’ve been for the last couple of weeks, okay? Can you do that? 

**SCP-3567-1-C:** I think so. 

**Dr. Simmons:** Ryan, do you know where you were two days ago? Before you were here?  

**SCP-3567-1-C:** I was here, but the colors were different. And Dr. Beann was here. 

**Dr. Simmons:** I’m confused, Ryan. What do you mean when you say “the colors were different”? 

**SCP-3567-1-C:** I’m not stupid! You guys painted the walls. The walls were gray before, now they’re white! 

**Dr. Simmons:** Good job, Ryan! There’s a window in your room now, correct? Was there a window in your room before? 

**SCP-3567-1-C:** Yeah. 

**Dr. Simmons:** Ryan, did you ever look out of that window? What did you see out there? 

**SCP-3567-1-C:** Before you painted the walls? Yeah, there used to be a tree outside. Now it’s just grass. Why’d you cut down the tree? 

**Dr. Simmons:** I’m not sure, Ryan. I’ll have to ask the landscapers.  

-- Portion of interview excluded for brevity -- 

**Dr. Simmons:** Ryan, can you tell me about the last time you remember being home, with your mom? 

**SCP-3567-1-C:** Yeah. There were those loud noises and ambulances and mommy just got her new phone. She let me play with the bubble wrap. And then... And then... I’m not sure. I-It doesn’t make sense. 

**Dr. Simmons:** That’s fine, Ryan. I won’t get upset if it doesn’t make sense. Just tell it to me as you remember it. 

//<Subject is silent for multiple minutes>//

**SCP-3567-1-C:** I-I was with Mom, and I was playing with the bubble wrap. Then it popped really big, and I was somewhere else. An apartment, like my friend Bobby’s. Dr Simmons, where’s my Mom? 

-- Remainder of interview excluded for brevity -- 

**<End Log, 4:11 PM, 07/05/2009>**

**Closing Statement:** It is highly likely that SCP-3567-1-C became upset after the mention of his mother. It is hypothesized that SCP-3567-1-D and SCP-3567-1-C could be the same subject. Further questioning should be conducted to determine the identity of Dr. Beann, especially in light of the presence of Junior Researcher Beann on the SCP-3567 research team.  

After consultation with Site Director Moose it has been determined that this information does not need to be restricted from Junior Researcher Beann.

------
I feel that it is imperative that SCP-3567-1-C be released from Foundation custody with a cover story matching that provided by SCP-3567-1-D. Too much potentially valuable intelligence was gained from interviews with SCP-3567-1-D to risk disrupting the flow of causality that lead to his experiences and his timeline. 
The further information provided by D-4028 during their travels in experimentation is of additional value. In light of D-4028's confirmation that the Foundation has secured SCP-3567-1-D in the future, I believe that this information is also at risk by further containing SCP-3567-1-C. 
While we have no guarantee that SCP-3567-1-D's timeline is our own, I believe that it is in our best interest to attempt to preserve the chain of causality that the subject provided to us to increase the likelihood of our secured intelligence being actionable.

After consultation with containment specialists, we have determined no undue risk in the release of SCP-3567-1-C. This request is conditionally granted; SCP-3567-1-C may be released pending amnesticization. 

To encourage the subject’s cooperation with observation, a cover story that the subject is afflicted with a rare neurological disorder will be implemented. 

A new identity consistent with that provided by SCP-3567-1-D will be provided. And a contingency plan will be put into place for the subject's retrieval in the event that it becomes apparent that SCP-3567-1-C and SCP-3567-1-D are the same subject. 

Periodic reports of SCP-3567-1-C's health and mental state will be submitted to the Head Researcher and Containment Specialist for SCP-3567.
