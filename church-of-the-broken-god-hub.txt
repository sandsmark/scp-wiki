**Description:** The Church of the Broken God is an anomalous religious organization which worships mechanization and believes flesh and life to be inherently evil or "broken". Though its origins are unknown, Broken God-related artifacts have been recovered from archaeological digs dating back to the Greek Classical period, and church dogma asserts its existence predates the appearance of life on Earth. Central to their theology is that their deity has been scattered, dispersed or otherwise rendered inert. Through the use of technology, often anomalous, Church followers seek to bring together the components of the body of God, thereby allowing the Divine a physical form to utilize and bringing about some sort of techno-organic apotheosis. Several SCP objects have been attributed to this group since its discovery. Personnel may reference items indexed under "broken_god" for a restricted list.

The current leader of the oldest extant denomination of "The Broken Church" (GOI-004A) is an individual identified in records as "His Holiness Robert Bumaro, Builder of the Broken God", who apparently gained the title in 1946.[[footnote]] Spanish Nationalist records from 1938 mention a civilian mechanic by the name of Umberto Bumaro, who received several governmental citations for "Miraculous feats of engineering and mechanical repair in service to the State". Whether or not this is the same individual, and his whereabouts during the Second World War, is unknown. [[/footnote]] While this sect continues its efforts to reconstruct their deity, the religion as a whole has at some time in the past century undergone a major schism. Two significant breakaway movements from the original church have entered into a major theological conflict.

The "Cogwork Orthodox Church" (GOI-004B) espouses a form of literal religious iconography known as "Standardization", whereby adherents submit to anomalous mechanical enhancement with the stated goal of remaking themselves in the image or plan of their deity. Due to the extent of their mechanical augmentation, members of this sect often emit audible ticking or tapping sounds, and have been referred to disparagingly as "Tickers" by members of the other two sects. 

Cogwork Orthodoxy deliberately adheres to technological norms of the late Industrial Revolution, and regard the mass-production of analogue, steam and clockwork-driven machinery as a form of prayer. Orthodoxy doctrine is highly centralized and regulated by a group of unknown composition, known as the Patriarchs. This body issues detailed production orders and design documents, which form the core of the group's extremely extensive holy writ. Orthodox belief decries the use of electronic or digital devices, and views distributed information sharing and decentralization as tantamount to the dissolution of divine knowledge.

The "Church of Maxwellism" (GOI-004C) represents a modernized, computation and network oriented means of worship. No central organizing church body is known to exist. However, interviews and covert surveillance has determined that all known cells are in regular contact with one another, and capable of coordination. Maxwellists favour small-scale body modification through the use of advanced cybernetics and organ enhancement. While artificial limbs or reinforced skeletons have been observed, Maxwellist implants focus primarily on communication, data storage, and networking capabilities, and sensory enhancement. 

Maxwellist doctrine interprets the Broken God as a "fragmented" deity, which exists as disparate data present in the linked technology and cultural //zeitgeist// of the digital age. Worshipers approach the divine by embracing their unique traits and sharing their knowledge and capacity for the good of the collective Church. By connecting all minds through computer networks, they believe their deity can be "recompiled" as the aggregate will of humanity. Due to their use of computer fan noise as a meditative aid, members are often referred to as "Hummers" by members of the other two factions.

[[tab Information]]

Church articles take the form of Holy Writ, a weird combination of technical manual and Biblical scripture. As it is obviously somewhat difficult to incorporate things like object classifications into scriptural form, the formatting guidelines for Church Holy Writ are somewhat different. For one, the style depends largely on which section of the Church you choose to focus on. They're divided up below.

**Broken God Writ**, which is to say the classic or old-school Church we know and love, does not follow any specific formatting guidelines, but the style is key. These are legends, or the transcriptions of legends, which are probably older than most human civilizations. The core goal here is a mythic tone, a tendency to cover vast sweeps of time and the kinds of writing you'd see in old legends and creation stories. These are records of the destruction of a god, and should treat their subject matter with the utmost gravitas. Classic church Writ is never straightforward: their subject matter is couched in deep metaphor and deliberate obfuscations.

**Cogwork Orthodoxy Writ** is like you stuck a notebook by Da Vinci or Brunel in a blender with a King James Bible. All Cogwork writ is taken from their massive //Schema of the Patriarchs//, and should be prefaced by an alphanumeric identification code hinting at the mind-numbing volume of written material the Orthodoxy produces. They are written in an archaic style with an intense devotion to detail and frequent use of cross-referencing. Remember that these are just as much factory output records and assembly line oversight documents as they are liturgical texts. Lines are individually numbered, with key words being capitalized. God is referred to as The MEKHANE, and the "Devil" as The FLESH.

What follows is a slightly expanded version of the simple organizational notes I kept while planning and writing the Cogwork Orthodoxy material for the contest. Obviously, none of this background info is totally all-encompassing or complete, and there are lots of gaps and absences that you, the author, should feel free to expand upon/exploit.

__Orders of the Orthodoxy__

* //Patriarchs:// A highly insular body of unknown composition and extent. Provides final decision-making and control over all Church matters, as well as producing the memoranda and texts that become the //Schema//.

* //Schematists-Faithful:// Print, compile and organize the //Schema// based on instructions from the Patriarchs. Theoretically equally-ranked with all the other Orders, but in practice exert slightly more political pull because of their editing privileges over Writ.

* //Legates-Faithful:// Internal affairs/Inquisition/Courts system. Investigate heresy, mediate disputes, entitled to direct action in cases of conflict within the Cathedral or other Church properties. One of the two officially Armed Orders, the other being the Militants.

* //Militants-Faithful:// External Affairs/Self-defence. Deal directly with overt and covert threats to the Church, beyond the purvey of the Legates. Function as ambassadors or representatives to other groups, except in matters of doctrine (wherein Militant forces might be used to supplement a core group of Legates). The first of the two officially Armed Orders, the other being the Legates.

* //Fabricators-Faithful:// Oversee production on Church properties. Act as foremen and quality control for Lay-Brothers and Sisters working in Fabrication duties. Determine which new Inventions are to be sent to the Patriarchs for Standardization approval.

* //Inventors-Faithful:// Tasked with refining and creating new potential Standardized designs. Embark on Quests to answer key questions of theology and design. By default, all Church Sentient Analytical Engines act as members of the Inventors.

__Notable Saints__

* //Saint-Legate Trunnion//: Patron of the Legates-Faithful, of the Tenacious, of Pragmatic Compromise. One of very few Orthodoxy Saints not canonized posthumously, for her casting out of the Factory during the early period of the Schism. Sometimes frowned upon by more conservative members of the Orthodoxy for her willingness to use relatively covert methods to root out heretical thought.

* //Saint-Schematist Platen//: Patron of the Written Word, of Editors, of Timetables and of Diagrammatic Organization. Enacted massive reforms of the newly-founded Schematists-Faithful during the early Schism, leading to the highly organized and cross-referential form of the 'modern' //Schema//. Also known for her frequent and highly successful dabblings in theology and philosophy.

* //Saint-Inventor Diaphragm//: Patron the Inventors-Faithful, of Designers, of Repairmen and of Cognition Engines. Founded the Inventors-Faithful and began the first Quests for Knowledge that would lead to early Cognition and Analytical Engines. Engaged in several well-known philosophical collaborations with Saint Platen which were fundamental to Orthodoxy philosophy of the mind.

* //Saint Scranton//: Patron of Spatial Fabric Manipulation, Higher-Dimensional Mathematics and Anthracite Coal Extraction. Known in life as the 19th-century American industrialist and politician George W. Scranton, he was never a member of the church but produced several key anomalous mechanical technologies that allowed for the analog manipulation of multi-dimensional spaces. His works were vital jumping-off points for both the Church and the SCP Foundation, who derived much of their reality-stabilization technology from Scranton inventions.

* //Saint-Fabricator Baffle//: Patron of Workflow and the Assembly Line. One of the earliest foremen of the Cathedral, Baffle was responsible for laying out the general organizational plan that the Cathedral's work areas follow today.

* //Saint-Inventor Chock//: Patron of Chorists. Dedicated his life to the study of sound, audiology, and to composing many of the Orthodoxy's most classic hymns. Most members of the Orthodoxy learn some or all of his //Symphony of Assembly// in childhood.

* //Saint-Inventor Enrichner//: Patron of the Enetelechiated. Very little about her personal life is known, save that she spontaneously vanished one day during a meeting of the other Inventors, leaving behind no personal effects save her seminal //In Search of Disembodiment//, considered the chief text for those more spiritual members who seek life beyond their corporeal forms.

**Church of Maxwellism Writ** can be taken from any number of sources. Maxwellist religious documents are distributed electronically, and are often shared and modified by individual members as a collaborative attempt to divine their true meaning. Their god supposedly is open-source and DRM-free, after all (though sysadmins being what they are, this may not always be the case). Maxwellist texts share the line-numbering scheme of Orthodox works, and refer to God as 'WAN'. The writing style here should be obviously formal, but generally simple and straightforward with the exception of technical terms. Instead of cross-referencing or providing detailed work figures, Maxwellist Writ emphasizes do-it-yourself construction and an almost instruction-booklet feel. Despite their sometimes esoteric compiling methods, their intended audience is not priests and scholars, but individual adherents of the faith.

All Holy Writ should have the follow title format:

> ++ Title of Book
> **Details of Book**
> # Verse 1
> # Verse 2
> # Etc...
