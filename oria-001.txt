The Arabic here is both religious in nature (Muslim prayers) and functional, as it serves to space out the table elements appropriately. Header lines should probably not exceed 75 characters or so to avoid running off the row, though it's up to you to determine how much runoff is acceptable. Sorry for the less-than-convenient need to navigate around them.

[[/ROW]]

**IN THE NAME OF ALLAH, THE MOST GRACEFUL AND MOST COMPASSIONATE:**
[[/=]]

1. Your message of 6 February was received. You have the congratulations of myself and the entirety of the Directorate for your ascension to the position of Supreme Leader. We all take faith that God has granted you the foresight to do as He wishes with His Islamic Republic.

2. The general concept of your message is understood. The Directorate provided considerable assistance to the //Irānzamīn// during the late War of Holy Defense, and did so enthusiastically. This was both at the request of your revered predecessor and in general desire to aid our home nation against outside invasion. There was much dissent among our Ba'athist Iraqi allies and members regarding this assistance, but we as an organization agreed that President Hussein's unbridled aggression and Western-style imperialism could not be accepted. Dissent was rerouted or suppressed, and our support for the anti-Ba'athist forces was -- and remains -- unwavering. You will have the support of the Directorate in all ways that we can find to support you.

3. This brings us now to the specific request of your last memorandum. Your request that the Directorate find a way to weaponize Project 001 or it make ready for strategic or tactical deployment brings up many difficulties. The theological implications of the very //existence// of the smoke are horrifying enough to consider. How could this be left on Earth for us to recover? How could this be left to humans to possess and contain? Is what little we have done with it so far already only so much hubris? Is this a gift from God or a test?

4. We have consulted with the Sunni Imam Arash Rezaei and the Shi'a Imam Muhammad Avesta. I have attached their recommendations to this document. In summary, Imam Rezaei suggested that the smoke be transported directly to Mecca, taken into the Ka'aba by several prominent high religious figures of several denominations (a precise list is contained in his recommendation), and consecrated unto God in the manner of returning a lost item to its owner. I must recommend against this plan for all of the obvious theological and political difficulties involved. 

5. Imam Avesta recommended that the smoke be returned to its point of discovery in Mount Sinai and that all records of its existence be destroyed, up to and including the memories of all individuals involved in the product. I must say that this plan does hold some appeal.

6. We must, at this time only and with the greatest respect alone intended, invoke Article 8, Sections 1-5 of the treaty that joined the Organization to the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran at the time of alliance, which gives the Director of the Organization the right to treat the protection of Earth as a whole as first priority over any other need or desire. If the use of the smoke brings down the wrath of God upon this world -- as, I might point out, is far from out of the question -- then this Director and this Directorate must, at all cost, protect all faithful Muslims and the rest of this world from that wrath.

7. This message transmitted 15 June 1989. 

-- Mohammad Khatami, Director, Islamic Artifact Recovery Directorate (ORIA)

**IN THE NAME OF ALLAH, THE MOST GRACEFUL AND MOST COMPASSIONATE:**
[[/=]]

1. Thank you again for placing your faith in me as the new Director of this Organization. The death of my predecessor leaves a large hole in the hearts of all of us here in Shemiran, but I understand the circumstances and assure you that my administration as Director shall be significantly more cooperative with the needs of the motherland than previous ones.

2. Testing with Project 001 is going according to schedule. The Type 2 Test Subjects are performing as expected; their spirits are less than excellent but their motivation has been assured through the measures put into place after my predecessor's death. Their ability to manipulate the smoke has been thoroughly confirmed in experimental conditions.

3. Experimentation has, to date, focused on tactical weapons considerations; the smoke can be "forged", in a sense, into remarkable weapons that can be operated by trained individuals. These weapons are difficult to describe in nature, but so far have been capable of simulating electrical bursts similar to lightning strikes and controlled seismic activity. The jurists now supervising the project have deemed this to likely be the apparati used by the //malāʾikah//, assuring me that neither consideration of this nor use of this is blasphemous in any way so long as it aids the Islamic State.

4. We are open to and will likely soon begin experimentation to develop strategic weapons platforms. The manipulative abilities of the smoke have been proven to have no necessary spatial or temporal limitations, though we would prefer not to use temporal manipulation technology until our command of the theoretical magicks involved are more extensive.

5. As requested, we will immediately begin accelerating our research in anticipation of the deployment schedule you have forwarded. I and my colleagues can only express the greatest confidence we have that, with your guidance and these gifts from God we are bending to our will, the armies of the oppressive Great Satans will soon fall before the might of the one true God just as those who have obstructed this path to this date have fallen from their revered statures. 

6. This message transmitted 11 February 2017.

-- Farhang Jahangir, Director, Islamic Artifact Reclamation Directorate (ORIA)

**IN THE NAME OF ALLAH, THE MOST GRACEFUL AND MOST COMPASSIONATE:**
[[/=]]

1. Forgive me, God, for I have sinned.

2. My hubris -- and the misfortunes which have befallen all of us can be placed on no other shoulders -- has beaten me. Shaytan and his demons whispered in my ear and encouraged me to permit my pride free reign, and the results come down now over our very heads. The uncontrolled climactic shifts and cataclysms wreaking havoc across the planet can only be attributed to Project 001 or, more accurately, our attempt to use it to our advantage in this recent war.

3. Please forgive us. We believed we were doing what was best for our people by striking down the Great Satan with the tools given to us by God, the smoke from which the heavens themselves were made forged into the weapons of the angels, and in doing so, we committed the error of Adam and reached for that which should have remained beyond us. Even if the enormity of our initial strike had been unsuccessful in ending any possibility of peaceful cooperation between us and our enemies, even if the millions of Europeans and Americans killed by the strikes and the terrible aftermath had not crippled the ability of our rivals to respond to us, I do not believe any force on this Earth could stand against the wrath of God.

4. The imams have told me that what is taking place does not resemble //Yawm al-Qiyāmah// to any significant degree. While the destruction of Mecca, the clouds of burning ash crossing the globe, and the distortion of time do resemble the signs leading up to the Day of Judgment, there has been no effort to remove the true Muslims from the line of fire. Believers have died as horrifically as pagans, the once-men now walking the Earth have rent the flesh of //imams// next to fornicators. This is not the Judgment promised to us by God, for we have proven ourselves unworthy. We, the Ayatollah and I, have proven all of you unworthy. No one comes to save us.

5. Please forgive us. We believed we were saving you. Once this message is sent, I intend to breach the bunker we are staying in and allow the Hell of the outside world to sweep those who truly deserve its flame. Perhaps -- and it is the last hope I have -- making a holocaust of the flesh of those truly responsible for this will spare what remains of the world. This computer will continue to transmit a message of warning automatically to all comers once per hour perpetually; if you can, as soon as you can, please destroy it and end the transmission. Prove that humankind can be saved.

6. This, my final message, transmitted 31 October 2018.

6. Muhammad, say unto humankind, "I am only a man like you to whom it has been revealed that your god is but one God; so take a straight course to God and seek forgiveness." And woe to those who associate others with God.

9. Say, "Do you indeed disbelieve in God, who created the earth in two days? Do you attribute equals to God? That is the Lord of the worlds."

11. Then God directed to the heaven while it was [[size 2.5em]] ##white|smoke##[[/size]] and said to it and to the earth, "Come into being, willingly or by compulsion." They said, "We come willingly."

13. But if they turn away, then say, "I have warned you of a thunderbolt like the thunderbolt that struck Sodom and Gomorrah."

14. As for Sodom, they were arrogant upon the earth without right and said, "Who is greater than us in strength?" Did they not consider that Allah who created them was greater than them in strength? But they were rejecting Our signs.

15. This message transmitted to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be unto him) 11 February 610.
