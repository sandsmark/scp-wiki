+ Overview

Mobile Task Forces (MTFs) are elite units comprised of personnel drawn from across the Foundation and are mobilized to deal with specific threats or situations that sometimes exceed the operational capacity or expertise of regular field personnel and -- as their name suggests -- may be relocated between facilities or locations as they are needed. Mobile Task Force personnel represent the "best of the best" of the Foundation.

Mobile Task Forces can vary greatly in size, composition, and purpose. A battalion-strength combat-oriented task force trained to deal with highly aggressive anomalous entities may consist of hundreds of troops plus support personnel, vehicles, and equipment and can be deployed in whole or in part to deal with threats across the globe. However, not all Mobile Task Forces are combat-oriented and a small, specialized intelligence-gathering or investigative task force may have fewer than a dozen personnel if that is deemed sufficient to accomplish their goals.

While in the field, task force members often pose as emergency responders, local or federal law enforcement, or military personnel appropriate to the region in which they are operating. Mobile Task Force Commanders can also request the assistance of local field units or personnel stationed at nearby Foundation facilities in order to accomplish their missions.

++ Organization

The organization of Mobile Task Forces varies greatly as each unit is fundamentally structured in a way that best suits their intended purpose. While combat-oriented task forces may closely follow military hierarchy and organization, smaller units may have an informal or otherwise esoteric chain of command.

As such, the responsibilities of the Mobile Task Force Commander (MTFC) for each particular task force can vary greatly; the commander for a large task force might focus on maintaining multiple teams and deploying them as necessary to each assigned operation, whereas the commander of a small team might deploy with their team and direct the operation from on location.

Similarly, the cohesion of each unit may vary greatly as well. Some Mobile Task Forces consist of personnel who have trained and worked for many years or even decades together, whereas the personnel of a Mobile Task Force formed on a moment's notice to deal with a specific incident may know little more than each others' names and fields of expertise.

++ Creation

Mobile Task Forces are typically commissioned as deemed necessary by the Foundation's Director of Task Forces, often with the direct approval of one or more O5 Council members. A significant number of Mobile Task Forces are created to deal with specific anomalies exhibiting traits that standard containment or response teams are unable to effectively counteract, though many were also created to pre-empt an emerging or theoretical threat.

++ Deactivation

Mobile Task Forces created for the purpose of containing a particular anomaly are typically deactivated at the end of the recovery operation or when ongoing containment is deemed no longer necessary. Occasionally, such task forces may remain operational if the expertise and experiences learned are considered useful for future incidents, but otherwise the task force will likely be disbanded and its personnel returned to their prior posts. Very rarely, a Mobile Task Force will also be disbanded if it suffers sufficient casualties to render it incapable of operation; in these cases, if the prior capability of that particular task force is deemed necessary, a new task force may be commissioned to replace it.

+ Mobile Task Force Database

The following is a partial list of notable Mobile Task Force units. Please note that this list is incomplete, as many Mobile Task Forces are mobilized for a specific operation and subsequently deactivated or are otherwise operating under protocols that preclude their mention in a document of this classification level. Many Mobile Task Force designations have also been reused over time for functionally different units.

**[[size 120%]]What is a Mobile Task Force?[[/size]]**

A Mobile Task Force is a team or group of personnel that represents the Foundation's best and most effective field agents and researchers and are sent in when ordinary facility personnel are unable or ill-prepared to deal with incidents or threats of a particular type. To take a medical analogy:

* The Foundation's technicians and guards are analogous to nurses; they can handle day-to-day concerns and routine tasks such as taking vitals or administering medication, but do not have the expertise or authority to diagnose conditions or perform complex procedures.
* The Foundation's containment teams, tactical teams, and researchers are analogous to primary care or family practice doctors; they can make generalized diagnoses and provide care of a more sophisticated nature, but their time is valuable, so they are only called in when they are needed.
* A Mobile Task Force is like a surgeon or other specialist; they are referred to or called in when the generally available personnel are unable to handle a situation or if the situation is beyond their capability. They are expensive and there are only a handful of them, but they are the best shot at handling any particular case well.

However, just like not all medical specialists are surgeons, not all Mobile Task Forces are armed soldiers carrying machine guns and explosives; considering that anomalies that the Foundation deals with can take all shapes and sizes, it isn't a stretch of the imagination that the Foundation might have task forces consisting of extremely smart field biologists or teams of elite hackers who have very specialized but non-combat roles.

----
**[[size 120%]]How big is a Mobile Task Force?[[/size]]**

As the guide states, a Mobile Task Force can vary greatly in size depending on their area of expertise and operational requirements. A team of hackers may have only a half-dozen members, but combat-oriented units may be much, much larger. To take an example from the U.S. military, it takes around 50 trained troops to safely assault an average home: one squad (at least a dozen men) to secure the perimeter, one squad to assault the building, and one squad in reserve to back the others up. When in doubt, please feel free to contact a [[[expert-witnesses|subject matter expert]]] who can help you come up with a plausible depiction of a task force suitable for your needs.

Alternatively, remember that a Mobile Task Force is an //elite// unit and not all SCP objects or entities require mention of such a task force; it wouldn't make sense for the Navy SEALs to be doing traffic stops or hunting down a petty thief, and it doesn't make sense for a Mobile Task Force to be mobilized for an inert object that doesn't pose an active or autonomous threat.

----
**[[size 120%]]When is a Mobile Task Force used?[[/size]]**

Remember, Mobile Task Forces are the elite, the best the Foundation has to offer. The individual field agents, containment teams, and response teams stationed at sites throughout the world are highly competent in and of themselves, but when they encounter something that even veteran personnel can't figure out, it's time to call in the experts from out of town.

Simply keep in mind that since they //are// the elite, that means that their services are both high in demand and low in availability. If it's just a milk-run, then there's no need to fly in a team from halfway across the world.

----
**[[size 120%]]Just how many Mobile Task Forces are there?[[/size]]**

As mentioned in the [[[Secure Facilities Locations]]] guide, this varies from author to author. Some authors believe in a vast and all-pervasive Foundation with over a hundred specialized task forces, whereas others believe in a smaller Foundation with maybe only a dozen active task forces. Both are correct interpretations; it's entirely up to which one best fits your narrative.

----
**[[size 120%]]Do I have to use one of the ones on this page?[[/size]]**

Not at all! This page is intended to inspire and to give a cross-section of consistent usages across the site and is only meant to give a general feel for how Mobile Task Forces work; you are more than welcome to create your own or even creatively contradict the usages given here. Remember, even in-universe, Mobile Task Forces are created and disbanded all the time; the Foundation may be a bureaucracy, but they are not stupid enough to believe that a rigid hierarchy of field personnel can handle all anomalies. Sometimes the best team for the job is the one you create on the fly.

----
**[[size 120%]]Adding New Entries[[/size]]**

Just as with the [[[Secure Facilities Locations]]] guide, this list is intentionally kept as short as possible and is not intended to be an exhaustive list of all task forces referenced site-wide. New entries should only be proposed for addition if they are consistently used across multiple articles or by multiple authors in the same manner and if they constitute a thematically distinct unit from the other ones already on the list. Task forces that are only referenced in a single article or otherwise do not have wide-ranging use should generally not be added. Please use the discussion thread for this guide to propose new additions.
