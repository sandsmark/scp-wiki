[[tab The Short Version]]
In order for your derivative work to be kosher, you need to do two things:

1. Attribute the works that you're using to the wiki and to the specific author, if possible. For example:

> **//682's Lovely Tea Party// is based on "SCP-682" by "Dr Gears": http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-682**

2. Add the [http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/ Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 license] (or CC-BY-SA for short) to the derived work. Doing this will release it under the CC-BY-SA license. 

Releasing it under the CC-BY-SA license means that people will be able to copy your work wholesale, and even sell it, provided that they properly attribute you and release their work under the same license.
-----
++++ Also, //do not sell anything related to SCP-173, SCP-111, or SCP-1926//. Please. It's a massive headache for all parties involved. And might get you sued, depending on the context. Just don't.

See the final tab "A Word on SCP-173 and Others" for more information.

[[tab The Long Version]]
++ Hey, the SCP Foundation is cool! I want to make something based off it! What should I do?

So, you want to make a work set in/based off of the SCP Foundation? That's awesome! Whether it's a game, short story, film, or anything else, we always welcome people who want to contribute to the SCP universe.

The SCP Foundation uses a specific Creative Commons license. If you want to make a work based in the SCP Foundation universe, this means you need to follow the rules of this license.

-----
++ Disclaimer
I am not a lawyer. The following is my understanding of the Creative Commons License and copyright law as a layperson.

-----

As mentioned earlier, the SCP Foundation uses a specific license, which has two key components: attribution and share-alike. Let's talk about attribution first.

++ Attribution
The first requirement under Creative Commons is "attribution." Any derivative works (stuff based on the SCP Foundation) must attribute back to the original source, the SCP Foundation wiki. If you use a specific SCP item or tale, you must attribute the individual article as well as the wiki. If you are using a general SCP Foundation idea (like a character, Group of Interest, or the concept of the Foundation as a whole) you only need to attribute the wiki in general.

[[collapsible show="+ Example" hide="- Hide"]]

> **//682's Lovely Tea Party// is based on "SCP-682" by "Dr Gears": http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-682**

In this case, if you wanted to do a work based entirely or partially on SCP-682, then you would need to add this somewhere accompanying the work.

You do not need to follow this exact format, but according to CC any attribution you provide **must** include:
1. The name of the work referenced.
2. The author's name, or whatever they wish to be known as. Online screen names work for attribution as long as they are in quotes, but if the author contacts you and wants you to use their real name or some other alias, you need to oblige.
3. A link back to the source material, or other forms of citation if you're somehow referencing offline SCP materials.
[[/collapsible]]

++ Share-Alike
Any content based on the SCP Foundation is itself going to be under Creative Commons. So anything you make, you agree to share as well under these same rules. **While there are other versions of the Creative Commons license, you MUST release your work under CC-BY-SA 3.0. You simply can't change the license to something else.**

This also means that anyone making stuff derived from your work has to attribute you as one of the creators, and that any work made from your stuff is under the same license as well. You can't stop people from doing derivatives, but you can ask them to attribute you in the way you see fit, such as linking back to your web page or project page.

In short, this means that **your derived work must be released under the CC-BY-SA, so that other people can use the same license. It is not enough to simply attribute the SCP Foundation.**

++ So What Can You Do?
So if you agree to these two things, what can you do?

* **Share**: You can share or repost anything from this site. You can copy-paste entire stories and articles in their entirety and repost them to your website. You can include them in any sort of compilations of creepypastas or stories. 

* **Remix**: You can make derivative works. You can make fanfiction, fanart, fan movies, fan mods, anything that fans can do. You could write up a TV show or movie. You can make posters or T-shirts. You can even. . . 

* **Sell**: You can sell the remixes you make based on the SCP Foundation. **However, keep in mind that you probably will not get rich off of them, because under Share-Alike, anyone can freely copy, use, or download your stuff, and you will have no legal recourse.**

[[tab FAQ]]
**I've got a great idea for a SCP webseries/movie/restaurant franchise, and I need to have someone lift the Creative Commons restrictions. Can I contact the senior staff and ask them to lift it for me?**

No.

The staff of the SCP Wiki act as custodians of the community and the site as a whole. //The staff cannot "suspend" the Creative Commons license for any reason whatsoever//. Don't ask.

However, an author can release their original idea, which may have been written as a SCP, under a different license for someone to use, but the article itself will still be covered under Creative Commons. Furthermore, the idea of the SCP Foundation, SCP Documentation, and all other aspects of the SCP Universe are Creative Commons and cannot be un-released.

This means that, Dr. Gears, for example, can sell the copyright to his original idea "Big Lizard That Hates People And Regenerates A Lot." However, he cannot sell the copyright to [[[SCP-682]]], because the idea of SCP-682, the SCP Foundation, etc. has been released under Creative Commons. And, even if he sells the copyright to "Big Lizard," SCP-682 will continue to work under Creative Commons.

**What do I do if the author of a work is unknown?**

Then put "author unknown" in the place of the author's name.

**Can I put an SCP article in a collection?**

Yes, you can. However, the SCP article, and anything derived from it (like an illustration), will still have to be attributed and still have to be released under the CC-BY-SA license. 

**Will you endorse our project or help us promote it?** 

That depends. If we like the finished product, and you follow the requirements laid out in the rest of this guide, we //may// consider promoting you/your product on our social media sites or the front page. 

//We as staff will not help you promote any sort of crowdfunding effort, or assist in development of your game, series, etc. Individual site members may do so if they want.// 

**Will you sign any sort of exclusive adaptation rights over to us?**

Nope, as we have no ability to do that, nor would it actually stop anyone from adapting something from us (or even using your own adapted works) so long as they have proper attribution listed for all parties.

[[tab A Word On SCP-173 and Others]]
+ THE IMAGE OF SCP-173, BASED ON THE SCULPTURE //[http://izumikato.com/filter/sculpture/Untitled-2004 Untitled 2004] SHOULD NOT// BE USED FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.

Some background: SCP-173 was the first SCP article and is the genesis of the entire SCP series. Like many images in the early SCP series, it was not attributed, being instead one of many creepy pictures floating around the internet. Staff eventually got into contact with Mr. Kato, and he gave us permission to use the image of //Untitled 2004// for the purposes of the wiki.

However he has not released the likeness of //Untitled 2004// under Creative Commons. He still holds the copyright to the sculpture. This means that you cannot use the sculpture, or its likeness, for commercial purposes.

While he has allowed the SCP Foundation to make use of the image of his sculpture, he has added the caveat that he "[plans] to take legal measures to demand an injunction if someone uses this image for commercial purposes." The full text of his message can be found [http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-76692/scp-173#post-2106398 here].

With that said, the text of SCP-173 //has// been released under Creative Commons BY-SA 3.0. If you want to sell copies of the text do so to your heart's content, //provided that you follow the instructions above//.

In addition, there are currently two other articles with similar provisions and limitations: [[[SCP-111]]] and [[[SCP-1926]]]. Information on [http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-469985/scp-111#post-1875695 111] and [http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-637979/scp-1926#post-2339539 1926] can be found by clicking through the linked text. 

In short, the images for those three, and the entirety of 1926, are barred from use in any commercial endeavor without the explicit permission of the rights-holders, and are not specifically released under our license. 

+++ This is not guaranteed to be an exhaustive list, and can be expanded at any time in the future. Please check back here, or with the Licensing or Image Teams, if you have concerns about an image or text on the site.
