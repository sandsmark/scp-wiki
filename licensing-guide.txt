+ So you want to make an SCP Derivative. . . 

So you've been hanging around the SCP Foundation Wiki, and it's inspired you to do some cool stuff. Maybe you want to make a mod for your favorite video game based on it. Maybe you want to make a fanfiction or draw some fanart. Maybe you want to make a full stageplay based on it. Maybe you just want to repost your favorite story or SCP article to your tumblr or your forum. Cool, right?

Woah. Hold up there. You see, SCP Foundation is based on a very specific license, called Creative Commons 3.0. On the one hand, it gives you the freedom to go ahead and do any of that stuff without getting in trouble with the law. . . and technically, it's very possible to get in trouble for doing any of the above under normal copyright law. However, there are still rules and regulations you have to abide by, as well as one HUGE issue that is often a game-killer.

Let's get started.

++ Disclaimer
One caveat: I am not a lawyer. The following is my understanding of the Creative Commons License and copyright law as a layperson. There may be small inaccuracies, which we will correct as they come up. And things get really complicated when you consider how Creative Commons interacts in unusual situations. That said, if you follow these rules you should be fine.

++ First off. . . 

Ask yourself these two questions.

1. Am I okay with other people copying and/or making derivatives of my work?
2. Am I willing and able to give credit back to the SCP Foundation wiki?

If the answer to either question is NO, then stop right there. Do not pass Go. Do not collect $200. Save yourself the pain and heartache.

++ Attribution
The first requirement under Creative Commons is "attribution." Any derivative works (stuff based on the SCP Foundation) must attribute back to the original source, the SCP Foundation wiki. You can do this easily, either by providing a link back to either the SCP Foundation Wiki as a whole, or the original source article you are referring to in your derivative.

One note: If you use a specific SCP item or tale, you must attribute the individual article as well as the wiki. If you are using a general SCP Foundation idea (like a character, Group of Interest, or the concept of the Foundation as a whole) you only need to attribute the wiki in general.

Here is an example of attribution for an article where the author is known: 

**(name of the work here) is based on "SCP-682 - Hard-to-Destroy Reptile" by "Dr Gears": http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-682**

In this case, if you wanted to do a work based entirely or partially on SCP-682, then you would need to add this somewhere accompanying the article/painting/game/sculpture/whatever. It doesn't have to interfere with the work or draw attention to it, it merely needs to be included somewhere.

Here is an example of attribution for an article where the author is not known:

**(name of the work here) is based on "SCP-173 - The Sculpture - The Original", author unknown: http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-173**

Several of our articles were either written before the move to Wikidot, so the authorship is in question, or were by people who later deleted their accounts. If you are uncertain of who to credit, you do still at least need to provide what attribution you can, so that others who read your work can attempt to find out who the original author was.

++ Share-Alike
This is where things get a little complicated. You see, any content based on the SCP Foundation is itself going to be under Creative Commons. So anything you make, you agree to share as well under these same rules. The best way to do this is to provide a link to the Creative Commons License. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/. 

This also means that anyone making stuff derived from your work has to attribute you as one of the creators. You can't stop them from doing so, but you can ask them to attribute you in the way you see fit, such as linking back to your web page or project page.

++ So What can you do?
So if you agree to these two things, what can you do?
* **Share**: You can share or repost anything from this site. You can copy-paste entire stories and articles in their entirety and repost them to your website. You can include them in any sort of compilations of creepypastas or stories. 
* **Remix**: You can make derivative works. You can make fanfiction, fanart, fan movies, fan mods, anything that fans can do. You could write up a TV show or movie. You can make posters or T-shirts. You can even. . . 
* **Sell**: We are not under a non-commercial license. You can sell the remixes you make based on the SCP Foundation. However, keep in mind that you probably will not get rich off of them, because under Share-Alike, anyone can freely copy or pirate your stuff and you have no legal recourse. But you could, for instance, ask people for five bucks to defray the cost of printing a poster, or something like that. 

++ One Last Note. . . 
We love our fan community. We've seen them do incredible things, ranging from entire video games to fanfictions to voice acting work. This is why we've set up this page, to try and protect them from getting in trouble.

But there is one thing we want to make perfectly clear: SCP Foundation was born of open collaboration, and it will continue to do so. It's no surprise that, after all these years, we are still a wiki. We abide by certain rules of conduct out of respect for each other, but in the end, the entirety of our existence is based on that open collaboration.

If you join us, by creating a derivative or remix, you will become a part of this community of open collaboration. On the one hand, it means that you will no longer own, in entirety, what you create: it will become part of the sandbox for every fan of the SCP Foundation to play with. On the other hand, you'll also have the opportunity to watch your little piece of the sandcastle grow under the hands of many other creators. 

We hope you'll decide to pick up a bucket and spade and join in.

Yours Sincerely, on behalf of the entire SCP Foundation community,

"Dr. Clef."
