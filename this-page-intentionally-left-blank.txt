Harry Blank is many things, to many people. To some he's an obscure internet writer they've never heard of, and they only know that much because they looked it up after you asked. 

Aaaaaand I'm tapped.

In the real world, assuming it still exists, I'm a PhD student and occasional university course instructor. I'm an historian! That will eventually become obvious in the stuff I write. I'm also from Canada! (I guess you can't say "from" when you're almost never not there, though, can you? Then again, I just did!) If you're wondering, which you aren't, which is fine, but if you are, yes! I can proofread your spelling and grammar. My mental car hits all the speedbumps.

//- actually looks himself up -//

Oh, hey, I'm a politician from Québec apparently! That's cool, I hope I'm good at it.

I adore words. I think a well-crafted sentence, with proper flow and some bitchin' word choice, is a thing of --almost-- pornographic beauty. For that reason my articles so far have absurdly-long edit histories as I keep thinking of better ways to say things which were already said perfectly acceptably weeks ago.

I am not a snarky egotist, though I may play one on TV for laughs. I am in fact a sensitive hyperresponsible wussy who fears being misunderstood and will receive criticism as a gut punch. I am extremely grateful for said gut punches, because I want anything I post to actually be good. Keep pummeling, people. 

And keep being fantastic! Because you //are// fantastic (especially if you're different from me) and the unimaginative shitheels who want you to think otherwise are just mad that they're going to go extinct and become "those fuckin' people" in the history books next to the original Nazis and the Spanish Inquisition and the McCarthyites. You can trust me on that; I help write the history books.

...in Canada, admittedly, but Canada is at least partially real world-adjacent.

So far, everything I've written here has been interconnected.[[footnote]] Most of what I've written //not// here, and not in academia, can be found by searching the internet for "gruglysims." The overlap between people who like SCP and people who like Sims 2 sex and death stories is, however, likely to be low.[[/footnote]] My first skip established a site and teased a disaster, my second skip fleshed out the site and developed the disaster, and my third skip //is// the disaster! (I was afraid it would also be //a// disaster, but nope!) You might get some extra nuance if you read them in order, but they should all work on their own just fine too.

I'm planning on getting through all the common Object Classes, from most to least common. So far I've got a Euclid, a Safe and a Keter! After the Thaumiel, which is well on its way, I've got some tales to tell.

Oh, yeah, I've got OCD.[[footnote]]Yes, actually.[[/footnote]] So try not to be surprised when you notice how many hundreds of revisions my sandbox and articles have.

**Item #:** [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-5056 SCP-5056]

**Object Lesson:** Meaning looking for you in all the wrong places.

**Special Quotation Procedures:** "I'm really sorry about what happened in the bathroom."

**Dissection:** An asymmetrical love story between a janitor and an eldritch abomination. How many years of being screamed at by a mirror monster can you take before it all gets a bit... samey? Less than eighteen, apparently. The concept came to me as I lay in bed reading the site and asking myself "So, got any ideas, since you're so damn smart?" I hadn't even been thinking that I was so damn smart, so that was pretty rude.

**Assessment:** My first SCP, and it //didn't// get deleted! I mean, it came close, but it got better. Literally. Literarily? And that's a good thing, 'cuz it sets up Site-43 and teases SCP-5243. There's a tie-in tale coming soon; I've got a lot of it written, and I'm looking forward to foisting it on y'all once I've kicked my Thaumiel and -J out the brain-door.

**Item#:** [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-5109 SCP-5109]

**Object Lesson:** What kinds of stories can a simple anomaly generate?

**Special Quotation Procedures:** "…it didn't even occur to me that it would work like that. It shouldn't work like that. Why does it work like that?"

**Dissection:** Take a phrase you can't forget unless you tell someone else (who then can't forget it themselves), add a bunch of scientists who're too clever for their own good, and stir until somebody loses fifty percent of their skin. I wanted a story where the researchers were the real anomaly — how much mischief could they get up to with this phrase, and how could I convey that without it becoming SCP-050 or some other lolFoundation thing? I wanted to create a whole series of short literary Rube Goldberg devices, microstories whirring with their own bizarre internal logic which only this specific plot device could enable. I ended up covering way more bases than I thought I could.

**Assessment:** So, apparently this clicks with most people! I am deeply gratified that you didn't think it was stupid, and the affirmation has been wholly uplifting. (Definitely go downvote it if you think it's stupid, though, because what's it doing there, being stupid? I mean what the fuck.)

**Item #:** [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-5243 SCP-5243]

**Object Lesson:** Where does all that ectoplasm go, anyway?

**Special Quotation Procedures:** "I wish this goddamn anomaly didn't have my forwarding address."

**Dissection:** A magic sewer explosion is bad. A magic sewer explosion that happens every year, and forces you to roleplay as your past self, and changes history if you do it wrong, is //hilariously// bad. I've been building to this idea for a while, now, and it was a lot of fun executing. Especially the Provisional Task Force idea, and its logo, which came late in the game. Oh, and all those ridiculous pictures. Clinical descriptions of magical shenanigans are a hoot.

**Assessment:** Went from a 15k-word magnum opus to a 2.7k-word bonum opus. I hope you think it's as bonkers as I do. I had //no idea// how this one would go over, because I was living inside of it so long I lost all perspective. So far, it's gone over super well! Well enough that it prompted the creation of this page. (Don't blame it, blame me. You can also blame me //for// it, though, obviously.)

Thus ends the Site-43 is Fuckin' Bonkers trilogy. Maybe now I can do a prequel trilogy with no soul and a sequel trilogy with no overall game plan?

No, I am not an old man. But he is! He's been putting out magic explosions since 2002, after all.
