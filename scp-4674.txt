**Item #:** SCP-4674

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4674 should be kept isolated from all other Foundation assets and is currently held at the dedicated Facility-4674. The facility is to be heavily secured against intrusion and theft, and a security team is to be stationed on guard at all times. Any intruders should be assumed to have a complete knowledge of the facility and of all defensive precautions. 

SCP-4674’s containment cell consists of two adjoining rooms, one outfitted as a bedroom[[footnote]]R-01[[/footnote]] and the other as a large dining room[[footnote]]R-02[[/footnote]]. Both rooms are decorated in a manner superficially resembling that of English nobility, circa the Regency era.

At least once weekly, a member of D-class personnel should be introduced to the containment cell to undergo the Valentine Procedure. 

[[collapsible show="Valentine Procedure" hide="Valentine Procedure"]]
> **Subject:** A member of D-class personnel between the ages of 18 and 35 with a physical resemblance to past successful candidates[[footnote]]see Document 4674-17 for full list of desirable features.[[/footnote]]. The subject should be briefed on the procedure and provided with a concealed earpiece for any essential communication. 
> 
> **[1800]** SCP-4674 is to be transferred from R-01 to a seated position at the table in R-02.
> 
> **[1805]** The subject is to be introduced to the containment chamber and seated opposite.
> 
> **[1810]** Two high quality meals accompanied by wine[[footnote]]See Document 4674-18 for a full list of acceptable meals and vintages.[[/footnote]] will be served by Foundation staff. 
> 
> **[1810-1900]** Subject will consume meal while engaging SCP-4674 in casual conversation, including multiple compliments related to its physical attractiveness and charm, while avoiding reference to specific physical details. At no point should the subject make any comments that could be construed as insulting.
> 
> **[1900]**  Foundation staff will dispose of SCP-4674’s meal and return the anomaly to the bed in R-01. If requested by SCP-4674 the subject will also lie on the bed and remain there for a minimum of 8 hours. No physical contact with SCP-4674 is necessary.

**Description:** SCP-4674 is an anatomically correct scale model of a human heart 50cm in height. It is entirely composed of cut red diamonds of sizes varying from approximately 0.25 to 300 carats. They are held in position by unknown means and are highly resistant to separation and damage. Given the large size, rarity and high quality of the gemstones used, SCP-4674 would be extremely valuable even disregarding its anomalous effects.

SCP-4674 is sapient and has an awareness of its surroundings, including audio and visual perception, both to a typical human level. It is entirely immobile but can emit audible speech through unknown means. Its vocalisations have no anomalous effects and any threats or demands can be safely ignored.

SCP-4674 claims it was once a human duchess in Regency England who was willingly transformed into its current state. No evidence has been found to corroborate this story and SCP-4674 is an unreliable information source. SCP-4674 will often threaten to take actions outside of its capability and make demands, typically for expensive luxury items and more frequent application of the Valentine Procedure with higher quality subjects, or occasionally, with repeated subjects. 

SCP-4674 has the additional, likely involuntary, capacity to manifest a projection within the dreams of certain individuals. The projection appears to people between the ages of 18-35 who are attracted to women. All known subjects have a history of theft, often of art pieces or other objects whose value derives from their aesthetics.The projection takes the form of a woman who the dreamer finds physically attractive, and then attempts to persuade the dreamer to steal SCP-4674. The projection displays an anomalously complete and detailed knowledge of any and all security measures put in place.

The projection has no power to compel and will initially tempt dreamers with the high value of the item and by describing in detail how good it would feel to possess. If this method fails alternatives will be tried including begging, threats of magical vengeance and promises of magical powers to be granted. SCP-4674 has shown no capacity to fulfil these threats or promises. 

These projections occur in response to SCP-4674’s emotional state, specifically when it feels that it is receiving insufficient attention or that its beauty is not being appreciated. Of note, SCP-4674’s other emotional needs, including general happiness, are irrelevant and as such, continued application of the Valentine Procedure is sufficient to prevent projection events. Subjects are rotated to prevent emotional attachment, which frequently leads to requests for greater time in their presence and increased displays of affection, denial of which can result in projection events.

SCP-4674 was obtained along with several other anomalous art objects from the collection of █████ ███████ after it was raided by the Foundation. Attempts to trace its origin have thus far been futile, however evidence has been found suggesting that █████ ███████ was merely the latest in a long series of owners, each having stolen it from the previous.

> **Interviewed:** SCP-4674
> 
> **Interviewer:** Researcher Harold Lafferty
> 
> **Foreword:** This interview was the final in a series conducted by Researcher Lafferty, after voluntarily being subject to the Valentine Procedure on multiple occasions. The goal of this interview was to question SCP-4674 about the origin of its anomalous traits.
> 
> **<Begin Log>**
> 
> //extraneous discussion removed//
> 
> **Researcher Lafferty:** Yeah, so I guess everything worked out in the end. Working for a place like this isn't exactly something I planned but it's certainly been worthwhile. Especially since it's what lead me to you.
> 
> **SCP-4674:** Oh, Harry, you are such a flirt.
> 
> **Researcher Lafferty:** You know me my dear, I like to share my feelings open and honest. But you've just sat through practically my whole life story. I want to hear about you, I feel like I hardly know anything.
> 
> **SCP-4674:** What? I've told you everything important I'm sure. Perhaps you'd like to hear about the time Princess Lieven and I-
> 
> **Researcher Lafferty:** No my dear, I'm certain that's a truly fascinating story but I was thinking about something else.
> 
> **SCP-4674:** Oh? Then ask away darling.
> 
> **Researcher Lafferty:** Well uh, how do I put this delicately? You've managed to remain... exceptionally beautiful for rather longer than most. I wondered if you might be willing to tell me how? If you trust me that is...
> 
> **SCP-4674:** Well, that’s rather a personal question to ask a lady but I suppose it is quite a tale so I’ll forgive your presumption just this once. In my youth I was the belle of every ball, I visited every lordly manor in the country. But as time passed I experienced the horrors of ageing, as all mortals must. I discovered just how cruel this world can be to an unmarried woman when her looks start to fade.
> I didn’t want things to end, I was desperate… and perhaps a little foolish. There was a man I knew of, someone who was known to help with impossible situations. There were dark rumours but I wanted to be beautiful so badly, to be loved again. I went to him. I explained the situation. And then this happened.
> 
> **Researcher Lafferty:** A good thing too, he made your beauty last forever, didn't he?
> 
> **SCP-4674:** I... Yes, yes I am beautiful. A beauty that will never fade, thank you for reminding me. I'll admit, sometimes I do wonder if I made the right decision.
> 
> **Researcher Lafferty:** Who was he? The man you spoke to I mean.
> 
> **SCP-4674:** Oh, that doesn't really matter now, he's long beyond both our reach. An artist you could call him perhaps, someone who knows what really matters in life. Why is it that you ask? Do I detect a hint of jealousy?
> //SCP 4674 laughs//
> 
> **Researcher Lafferty:** Well it seems you’re not the only one to benefit from his gifts, we have two others we’ve been assisting that we believe were affected by the same individual.
> 
> **SCP-4674:** Oh, well I know nothing of that, and I certainly shan't help you kidnap him or anything of the sort if that is your intention! He was… very kind to me.
> 
> **Researcher Lafferty:** I’m sorry if I’m upsetting you with my questions, my dear, I just have one more if you would be so kind? Then we may retire for the evening and leave this unpleasantness behind us.
> 
> **SCP-4674:** Oh, very well, but be quick about it Harry, or I’ll start to think you’re no better than those dreadful bores who tried to lock me away.
> 
> **Researcher Lafferty:** Well, you see, the two others I spoke of both lived in rural areas of the American South, and we believe the person responsible is a trickster deity localised to that region. And we’ve found no records of a woman of your description going missing in Britain at that time. Landed gentry don’t just go missing with no records, you see? But we have found a woman from a small town in Kentucky who went missing in 1986, just before the first recorded appearance we have of you in your current state. No family, no close friends or romantic partners we could find, matches the physical description you gave us and seems to have had a particular fascination with Regency romance novels. Do you remember the name Georgia Fennel?

> //no audio recorded for 24 seconds//
> 
> **SCP-4674:** I am beautiful. Beautiful and loved forever, just as he promised me. If you cannot see that, it is you who are the fool, not I.
