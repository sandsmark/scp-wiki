**Item #:** SCP-328

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** During ███ years of containment, SCP-328 has not shown any signs of being dangerous to researchers. It is to be kept in a secure locker in storage area 328-A. Access for research requires L3 authorisation and will be permitted in most instances. Due to its unclear nature, SCP-328 is not to be allowed into contact with any data-reading device with a connection to the internet or the Foundation intranet. Electronic devices which have been used to study SCP-328 should be clearly labeled "SCP-328 Use Only" and stored in storage area 328-A for common use in case of unidentified viral properties. A small isolated lab adjunct to storage area 328-A (designated 328-B) has been established to this end.

**Description:** SCP-328 is a smooth, greenish-yellow disc approximately ten (10) cm in diameter and 4mm thick, weighing just over thirteen (13) grams, comprised of an unknown crystalline organic compound. The bonding pattern of SCP-328 is highly organised, in a manner suggesting it may be a data storage device. This suggestion has been supported by the production of [[[SCP-328-01]]], a data file that appears to be a partial recovery of data stored on SCP-328. 

Various analyses of samples of SCP-328 have been inconclusive; some known atomic elements have been identified, but none in recognised compositional patterns, and not enough to account for the mass of the samples used. It is slightly warmer (about 4 degrees Celsius) than its surrounding environment, even when subjected to extreme temperatures. It is susceptible to kinetic damage, but if broken, reforms itself from its largest remaining piece over a period of one week to six months, depending on the severity of damage. Crystallographic analysis of fragments indicates they possess a restructured crystalline form, a scaled-down version of the whole item's structure. As the disc regrows the structure re-expands and returns to its original form. No changes have been observed in binary data obtained from the disc-reader (see below) before and after breakage/reformation.

SCP-328 has been in the possession of the Foundation since ██-██-18██, when it was recovered from [DATA EXPUNGED]. Until ██-██-19██, the purpose and nature of SCP-328 was uncertain. In an accidental breakthrough, SCP-328 was inserted into an experimental disc drive that had been treated with [REDACTED] as part of the [REDACTED] project (see Addendum 328-1). SCP-328, when used with this reader, produces binary data.

Multiple cryptographic analyses of the binary code produced suggest that at least some of it is a description of data contained on SCP-328. An algorithm for converting the binary into ASCII code has been developed, and the current extent of translation is attached as [[[SCP-328-01]]]. Veracity of this data is uncertain, but given the coherence of the data produced it seems unlikely it is a random 'fluke'. Curiously, the data obtained is written in over thirty (30) known languages (transliterated into Roman characters) in what appears to be a single article.

Further attempts to directly access and translate the data on SCP-328 have proven labour-intensive, and full funding for the project has been pulled. Dr. E██████ has announced that anyone with relevant skills (cryptography, data storage/recovery, or linguistics in particular) is welcome to take up translation of SCP-328 as a "hobby item".

**Addendum 328-1**: As Project [REDACTED], which produced the original SCP-328 data reader, has been canceled for over a decade, Dr. E██████ has lodged a formal request for O5 clearance to remove the redaction of this information, allowing anyone working on 328 to consider this information. Permission is pending.
