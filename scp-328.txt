**Item #:** SCP-328

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** During ███ years of containment, SCP-328 has not shown any signs of being dangerous to researchers. It is to be kept in a secure locker in storage area 328-A. Access for research requires L3 authorisation and will be permitted in most instances. Due to its unclear nature, SCP-328 is not to be allowed into contact with any data-reading device with a connection to the internet or the Foundation intranet. Electronic devices which have been used to study SCP-328 should be clearly labeled "SCP-328 Use Only" and stored in storage area A-328 for common use in case of unidentified viral properties. A small isolated lab adjunct to storage area A-328 (designated 328-B has been established to this end.

**Description:** SCP-328 is a smooth, greenish-yellow disc approximately ten (10) cm in diameter and 4mm thick, weighing just over thirteen (13) grams, comprised of an unknown crystalline organic compound. The bonding pattern of SCP-328 is highly organised, in a manner suggesting it may be a data storage device. This suggestion has been supported by the production of [[[SCP-328-01]]], a data file that appears to be a partial recovery of data stored on SCP-328. 

Spectrometric analysis of samples of SCP-328 have been inconclusive; Dr. E██████ hypothesises that it contains components unfamiliar to our world, although only [DATA EXPUNGED] exists to support this tenuous supposition. It is slightly warmer (about 4 degrees Celsius) than its surrounding environment, even when subjected to extreme temperatures. It is susceptible to kinetic damage, but if broken, reforms itself from its largest remaining piece over a period of one week to six months, depending on the severity of damage. Crystallographic analysis of fragments indicates they possess a restructured crystalline form, a scaled-down version of the whole item's structure. As the disc regrows the structure re-expands and returns to its original form. No changes have been observed in binary data obtained from the disc-reader (see below) before and after breakage/reformation. Assertations that data storage on SCP-328 is holographic are purely conjectural at this time, as SCP-328's nature as a data storage device is still presumptive.

SCP-328 has been in the possession of the Foundation since ██-██-18██, when it was recovered from [DATA EXPUNGED]. Until ██-██-19██, the purpose and nature of SCP-328 was uncertain. In a breakthrough event described as "a stupid lab tech getting lucky" by Dr. E██████, SCP-328 was accidentally inserted into an experimental disc drive that had been treated with [REDACTED] as part of the [REDACTED] project[[footnote]]This project has been cancelled for over a decade. Can we reopen access to this data, so we can experiment with the reader? -- Dr. E██████[[/footnote]]. SCP-328, when used with this reader, produces binary data.

Multiple cryptographic analyses of the binary code produced suggest that at least some of it is a description of data contained on SCP-328. An algorithm for converting the binary into ASCII code has been developed, and the current extent of translation is attached as SCP-328-01. Veracity of this data is uncertain, but given the coherence of the data produced it seems unlikely it is a random 'fluke'. Curiously, the data obtained is written in over thirty (30) known languages (transliterated into Roman characters) in what appears to be a single article.

Further attempts to directly access and translate the data on SCP-328 have proven labour-intensive, and full funding for the project has been pulled. Dr. E██████ has announced that anyone with relevant skills (cryptography, data storage/recovery, or linguistics in particular) is welcome to take up translation of SCP-328 as a "hobby item".
