**Item #**: SCP-528

**Object Class**: Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** All items designated SCP-528 are to be kept inside of their individual container when not in use. In the case of a missing or damaged container, a new, non-individualized container will be commissioned. All containers of SCP-528 are to be kept in secure storage locker Z-12 at Site 23. Senior Staff at Site 23 are to be given the combination to said locker. The combination is to be changed on a weekly basis. No personnel with clearance of less than Level 3 are approved to perform tests on SCP-528.

**Description:** There are currently seven (7) instances of SCP-528 in Foundation control. All recovered SCP-528 instances have been found in small, red, plastic containers, which are visually identical to those used by the Silly Putty Corporation, except that the Silly Putty Corporation logo has been replaced by the text, "The Factory".

SCP-528 appears to be an inorganic polymer, composed of 66% dimethyl siloxane (hydroxy-terminated polymers with boric acid), 17% silica (crystalline quartz), 9% Thixatrol ST (castor oil derivative), 4% polydimethylsiloxane, 1% decamethyl cyclopentasiloxane, 1% glycerine, 1% titanium dioxide, and 1% [REDACTED]. While its chemical makeup is similar to regular Silly Putty, SCP-528 has several differences. It has proven to be completely resistant to tearing, although indentation is possible. Additionally, SCP-528 retains two (2) times as much of the original force as regular silly putty.

Anomalously, however, SCP-528 is capable of copying any image of a human being that it is pressed onto. SCP-528 retains this property regardless of whether ink is involved, and has successfully been copied from paper, photopaper, computer screens, televisions, and [REDACTED]. Once an image has been placed on SCP-528, the only ways to remove it are to crumple SCP-528 into a ball, or to apply rubbing alcohol.

Any actions taken upon SCP-528 affect the individual pictured as well, usually resulting in the death of the pictured individual.

**Test 1**
SCP-528 applied to picture of D-528-1. Pressure applied to SCP-528, causing images arm to stretch. D-528-1 screamed in pain, his own arm stretching one inch per centimeter the image was stretched. Detailed X-rays reveal bones and flesh of D-528-1 to have been [DATA EXPUNGED]. At approximately five inches stretching of SCP-528, a gap formed in the image. D-528-1's arm came off at the same place, bloodlessly. Further testing revealed that while D-528-1 was still affected by SCP-528, his arm no longer was.

**Test 2**
SCP-528, still bearing the image of D-528-1, is doused in rubbing alcohol, in attempt to remove image.  As alcohol is applied to parts of the image, analogous parts on D-528-1 vanish. When the torso is wiped away, D-528-1 ceases life functions. At this point, SCP-528 ceases to apply to D-528-1, and is cleaned with no further incidents.

**Test 3**
SCP-528 applied to image of D-528-2. SCP-528 is then crumpled into a ball, the image of D-528-2 on the inside.  D-528-2 is condensed into a ball as well, however, his bones do not break, and subject continues to scream until his head is rolled into his abdomen. At this point it is believed subject suffocates, as SCP-528 stops applying to D-528-2. When unrolled flat, image of D-582-2 is no longer visible on SCP-528.

**Test 4**
SCP-528 applied to image of D-528-3. SCP-528 is then immersed in boiling water. D-528-3 begins to complain of the heat. After approximately 5 minutes, the image of D-528-3 on SCP-528 begins to run. D-528-3 begins to screams as he melts, flesh and bone both sagging equally. Testing is concluded when his nose melts over his mouth, blocking his breathing and leading to his suffocation.

**Note:** Although clothes are duplicated in the transference of ink, they are not affected by SCP-528 in any way.
