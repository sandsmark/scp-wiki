**Item #**: SCP-528

**Object Class**:Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** All items designated SCP-528 are to be kept inside of their individual containers when not in use. In the case of a missing or damaged container, a new, non individualized container will be commissioned. All containers of SCP-528 are to be kept in secure storage locker Z-12 at Site 23. Senior Staff at Site 23 are to be given the combination to said locker. No one of lower class then 3 are approved to work on SCP-528. The combination is to be changed on a weekly basis.

**Description:** There are currently seven instances of SCP-528 in Foundation control. SCP-528 can be found in small, red, plastic containers, similar visually identical to those used by the Silly Putty Corporation, except that the Silly Putty logo has been replaced by "The Factory."

SCP-528 appears to be an inorganic polymer, composed iof 65% dimethyl siloxane (hydroxy-terminated polymers with boric acid), 17% silica (crystalline quartz), 9% Thixatrol ST (castor oil derivative), 4% polydimethylsiloxane, 1% decamethyl cyclopentasiloxane, 1% glycerine, and 1% titanium dioxide. While similar to common Silly Putty, SCP-528 has several differences. It has proven to be completely resistant to tearing, although indentation and apparent cuts are possible. When formed into a ball and thrown, SCP-528 bounces twice as much as the regular kind.

The main difference, however, is that SCP-528 is capable of copying any picture of a human being it is pressed upon, no matter if ink is involved. It can retain an image from paper, photopaper, even from a television or computer screen. Once an image has been placed on SCP-528, the only way to remove it is to crumple SCP-528 into a ball.

Any actions taken upon SCP-528 affect the individual pictured as well, usually resulting in the death of the pictured individual.
