**Item #:** SCP-462

**Object Class:** Euclid 

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-462 is stored in a temperature- and humidity-controlled vault at Site ██. Under no circumstances are D-Class personnel to be allowed near the object. Despite its state of disrepair, SCP-462 does not show any signs of further deterioration due to rust.

**Description:** SCP-462 is a 1968 Chevrolet El Camino in a state of serious disrepair, with several broken windows and severe rust damage. A single key is inserted into the ignition. To date, all attempts at removing the key have failed. If a human sits in the driver's seat and turns the key as if to start the vehicle, they will instantaneously disappear. Around 42% of SCP-462’s drivers have been known to suddenly reappear without the vehicle at a distant location after 43 seconds, typically standing in the spot that they have confirmed as being their chosen destination. Subjects report that they are driving during the time they are gone, and express confusion regarding the experience and their sudden re-appearance. Many of these reports contradict the time between vanishing and reappearing, with drivers insisting that more than 43 seconds have passed. In 35% of these cases, the test subject never reappears and cannot be located, even when fitted with a GPS transceiver. The remaining 23% of test subjects [DATA EXPUNGED].

The object first came to the Foundation’s attention on October 5th, 2███ when ██████ Marshall inadvertently used it to find his father, who was serving a life sentence at ███████ █████ Penitentiary, ████ KM from its original location. The prison’s security staff detained Mr. Marshall soon afterward. Questioning was carried out by Agent ███████, who was working undercover as one of the guards. SCP-XXX was immediately located and moved to Site ██ without incident.
