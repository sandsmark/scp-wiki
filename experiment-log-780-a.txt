title:Experiment Log 780 A
The following experiments were performed to evaluate the extent of SCP-780's abilities

**Experiment 780-e1**
**Host Plant**: Sunflower
**Result**: Full-grown sunflower produced in 24 hours, with one new copy of SCP-780 within flower

**Experiment 780-e2**
**Host Plant**: Photograph of sunflower used in Experiment 780-e1
**Result**: Resulting flower was identical to the one produced in Experiment 780-e1

**Experiment 780-e3**
**Host Plant**: Painting of sunflower used in Experiment 780-e1
**Result**: Resulting flower was similar to the one produced in Experiment 780-e1, but slight differences (number of petals, shades of color) showed it to be a copy of the painting, not the original plant.

**Experiment 780-e4**
**Host Plant**: Painting of sunflower, with only a single purple petal rather than many yellow ones
**Result**: Resulting flower matched that of the painting

**Experiment 780-e5**
**Host Plant**: The word "sunflower"
**Result**: No response

**Experiment 780-e6**
**Host Plant**: A one-paragraph description of a sunflower
**Result**: Resulting flower matched description in paragraph

**Experiment 780-e7**
**Host Plant**: A one-paragraph description of a bush which produces chocolate bars
**Result**: Resulting bush shares physical appearance with description, but "chocolate bars" are in fact fruit, with a dark, fleshy interior that (according to D-class testers) only has a passing resemblance to the taste of chocolate. Each fruit contains a copy of SCP-780, indicating that these fruits would normally contain seeds on their interior.

**Experiment 780-e8**
**Host Plant**: A one-paragraph description of a bush which produces health bars which contain a week's worth of calories and nutrients in every bite
**Result**: Resulting bush shares physical appearance with description, with the "bars" again being fruits containing copies of SCP-780. Tests verify that these are fairly nutritious, with a wide variety of vitamins and minerals, but only contain slightly more sustenance than an ordinary fruit or vegetable. Further research on exploiting SCP-780 to provide variety in the Site ██  canteen on hold pending approval.

//If we can make fruits as healthy as Brussels sprouts but as tasty as strawberries, imagine the marketing possibilities...we just need to find a way to remove the copy of SCP-780 embedded at the heart of each fruit.//
//- Dr. █████████//

**Experiment 780-e9**
**Host Plant**: A one-paragraph description of [DATA EXPUNGED]
**Result**: [DATA EXPUNGED]

//Remember, SCP-780-1 only has the vulnerabilities of the host plant! Anyone at Site ██ found with text reading "Invulnerable tree which reaches to the moon" will be demoted to Keter duty!//
//- Dr. █████████//

**Experiment 780-e10**
**Host Plant**: [[[SCP-038]]]
**Result**: Resulting plant appeared identical to SCP-038, but lacked its ability to reproduce items touched to its trunk

**Experiment 780-e11**
**Host Plant**: [[[SCP-143]]]
**Result**: Resulting tree identical in appearance with SCP-143. Bark has the same hardness as SCP-143, but pieces removed from SCP-780-1 lose this property and retain only the hardness typical of a //Prunus// x //yedoensis// tree. Petals have no unusual properties.

**Experiment 780-e12**
**Host Plant**: [[[SCP-417]]]
**Result**: While exhibiting the outward appearance of SCP-417, fruit only contain more copies of SCP-780

//Further testing on plant-like SCP objects is suspended, as their unique abilities do not appear to be reproduced.//
//- Dr. █████████//
