**Item #:** SCP-518

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-518-A is to be monitored by a field research team consisting of at least three (3) staff and one (1) project lead, supplemented by two (2) security staff. This team shall be based at Remote Observation Site-18, 3 km from SCP-518-A. An automated security perimeter surrounding SCP-518-A is to be established and maintained.

One (1) physical copy of SCP-518-B is authorized to exist at any given time for the purposes of research. This copy is to be kept at all times in an opaque, protective sleeve, sealed in a locked container and kept in Storage Locker 742 in Restricted Access Wing 1 of Site-93. One (1) electronic copy is permitted to be accessible from authorized terminals at Site-93 and Remote Observation Site-18. Any additional instances of SCP-518-B discovered by Foundation personnel are to be destroyed immediately or, in the case of electronic media, deleted (see Clandestine Electronic Data Interference Guide for additional details). 
  
**Description:** SCP-518 is a localized anomalous phenomenon, catalyzed by the dissemination and exposure of SCP-518-B. 

SCP-518-A is, currently, a complex consisting of eleven wooden structures in varying states of repair, designed and built in the style of structures common in newly-settled areas of the American West during the mid-19th century. These structures are arranged in a manner inconsistent with an established settlement; buildings are arranged in a roughly circular pattern, with no regard to road systems or natural topography (one structure is currently located on top of a creek). SCP-518-A is located in rural Deschutes County, Oregon, United States, in the vicinity of the Metolius River.

The buildings that make up SCP-518-A superficially resemble commonly found structures of the region during the 1850s and 1860s. In addition to several houses, there are currently a barn, a three-story hotel, a church, and a saw mill. However, the interiors of these structures are atypical of traditional dwellings and establishments. Features such as walls, floors and ceilings tend to be arbitrarily constructed; houses have been observed to have rooms with no doors, non-level floors (one dwelling is constructed with a "floor" at a 37^^0^^ angle), ceilings of a height of 1 m or less, etc. Furniture and household items typical of the period are also present, but are arranged haphazardly (in several cases, chairs and beds have been observed nailed to walls and ceilings). Other buildings contain no features inside, while the "barn" merely covers an open shaft extending to a depth of 120 m.

The land area comprising SCP-518-A is gradually undergoing conversion into a sinkhole, and is currently experiencing subsidence at a rate of approximately 2-3 m per SCP-518-B event. Current projections estimate that SCP-518-A will be completely submerged by the local water table after 25-30 additional SCP-518-B events.      

SCP-518-B is a short narrative, first documented upon the initial exploration of SCP-518-A (see Exploration Log 518-1). Whenever SCP-518-B is read in its entirety by a sapient, comprehending individual, SCP-518-A undergoes spontaneous physical changes. In most cases, these changes entail the movement of structures in relation to each other, rearrangement of the interior features of these structures, and a small amount of subsidence in the immediate geographic vicinity of SCP-518-A. In some cases, readings of SCP-518-B will cause new structures to appear, or existing structures to simply cease to exist. Research has determined that these physical changes occur either instantaneously or at speeds beyond the observational capability of current technology. 

Forensic evidence indicates that prior to the establishment of containment in 1992, an unknown number of persons undertook explorations of the SCP-518-A site. This accounts for the limited notoriety achieved by SCP-518-B, which was transcribed in varying degrees of accuracy and completeness and disseminated through several channels[[footnote]]Foundation staff have observed SCP-518-B instances in several pamphlets issued by groups in the Pacific Northwest survivalist community, a self-published magazine purporting to document "paranormal events", and several posts on the now-defunct "alt.rec.oregon-ghost-towns" newsgroup.[[/footnote]]

Below is a partial transcription of SCP-518-B:

> In the year of our Lord 1853, Asa Rutledge of Grett's Hollow, Kentucky[[footnote]]Recovered records from Jessamine County, Kentucky confirm an individual of that name and time period; however, no records of such a location exist at this time[[/footnote]] traveled for two months to commit an unforgivable deed. When his hatred and his madness died away, Asa saw what he had done and████████████████████████████████████████████████.

> ████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████, and the monotone laughter of a man no one knew wheezed deep in the woods. Asa Rutledge stayed in a town with no citizens to hear it stop. There were no safe places in this town, and no place that had Asa Rutledge in it was safe. He hid in the old barn anyway. It was far from the saw mill.

> Only one man of a council of five was there to hear the laughter stop. ███████████████████████████ ████████████████████████████████.

>  █████████████████████████████████████████████████████████

Since the establishment of containment, the Foundation has documented 15 spontaneous changes in the composition of SCP-518-A that can be reasonably traced to the reading of SCP-518-B. Of these incidents, 13 have occurred under controlled research conditions.

**Exploration Log 518-1:** Upon initial containment of SCP-518 in February of 1992 and the establishment of Remote Observation Site-18, staff undertook an initial exploration of SCP-518-A[[footnote]]At the time, SCP-518-A consisted of nine structures, and included a church and a schoolhouse that do not currently exist. The saw mill structure and two current houses had not yet manifested.[[/footnote]]. A team consisting of four D-Class personnel was dispatched to the site, equipped with two-way radios, flashlights, water, emergency rations, crowbars, and a camcorder. Dr. Lupe Carmona, then the Research Director for SCP-518, supervised the exploration from Remote Observation Site-18. Selected transcripts are reproduced below:

> **Dr. Carmona:** Supplies have been checked and accounted for, all personnel present. D-32995, do you read me?

> 
> **D-32995:** It's pretty dark in there. 
> 
> **Dr. Carmona:** Illuminate the area and get video of the interior. 
> 
> //Flashlights from off camera reveal that the interior of the structure is typical of a structure of the apparent time period, with the exception of a dresser mounted on the ceiling, and a floor sloping at a pronounced angle towards the southern wall.//

> **D-94237:** You seeing this?
> 
> **Dr. Carmona:** Affirmative. Please proceed carefully into the house and document the surroundings.

> 
> **D-22343:** Hold on, lemme take a look...um, it's uh...what is that?
> 
> //D-48983 positions the camcorder over D-22343's shoulder. D-48983 appears to be handling an undetermined object while crouched over a hole.//
> 
> **Dr. Carmona:** What are you handling? Please refrain from any unnecessary forensic contamination. 
> 
> **D-22343:** It's uh...it's nothing. There's nothing in any of these.

> 
> //Video feed indicates that the floor of the crawl space is filled with dozens of holes corresponding to D-22343's description. D-48983 and D-22343 then rejoin the other exploration members without incident and leave the structure.//
> 
> //Video feed is turned off until the exploration team reaches the "church" structure then present at SCP-518-A. Dr. Carmona orders the team to proceed inside, where they discover an entirely empty structure. The exploration team documents the interior until D-32995 pauses at the southwestern wall.//

After approximately twenty-five minutes, D-32995 finishes writing and appears to read his notes. A low rumbling sound immediately starts, and the camcorder appears to start shaking.//

> In the year of our Lord 1853, Asa Rutledge of Grett's Hollow, Kentucky traveled for two months to commit an unforgivable deed. When his hatred and his madness died away, Asa saw what he had done and, with the help of an unnameable man committed an irrevocable act. 
> 
> For three days, blood pulsed in the trees in the woods, and the monotone laughter of a man no one knew wheezed deep in the woods. Asa Rutledge stayed in a town with no citizens to hear it stop. There were no safe places in this town, and no place that had Asa Rutledge in it was safe. He hid in the old barn anyway. It was far from the saw mill. 
> 
> Only one man of a council of five was there to hear the laughter stop. Asa saw it through to the end and shook hands with the unnameable man before beginning the work on a tomb.
