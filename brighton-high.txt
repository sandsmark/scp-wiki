**Commentary:** The following is a complete list of commentary from the subject regarding their projects and files, in order of completion.

[[collapsible show="+ Show Commentary" hide="- Hide Incoherent Narcissistic Ramblings"]]

> = **SCP-2772-J**
> 
> This is the first article on the wiki that survived. I //actually// thought I'd be stuck only writing joke articles, but this mindset proved false. If [http://scpper.com/page/24631418 SCP-DEALS-J] still existed, Gleason's little Explorer would be downvoted into oblivion and I wouldn't be here.
> 
> **Fun Fact:** I //know// it's an Expedition, but they look similar enough.

> = **SCP-3763**
> 
> Second article. An attempt at making people feel things, but in hindsight would've been stronger exploring MC&D tropes. Also possibly a bit cliche, since it's a "overpowered item" trope, but the drawbacks are there. Knapp still can't rid the taste of oil.
> 
> **Fun Fact:** I called that exact Biscayne a "Bel Air" once, didn't go well.

> = **ZLQMK/6XY4R/V4D3R**
> 
> Third article. Ties into 3763 in a way that maybe wasn't the best. Did receive the [[*user RockTeethMothEyes]] Seal of Approval. I made it a bit too long, but it gets the point across. Boudames is still known as a dirty double-crosser at Site-48.
> 
> **Fun Fact:** RTME uses a similar signature style for Amos Marshall in [http://www.scp-wiki.net/dream-daycare D2924/6RE33/945AM].

> = **SCP-4081**
> 
> Fourth article. Used to be an infinite hallway, but was scrapped. That was a good idea. Eventually it morphed into a story about an angry non-Euclidean PTA doxxing the Foundation with their notes. Lutz never moved back into her old house.
> 
> **Fun Fact:** Received the [[*user pxdnbluesoul]] Seal of Approval in the Week 12 Recap SCP Cafe Podcast. 

> = **SCP-3987**
> 
> Fifth article. [[*user DrLeibowitz]] knows it as "The Screaming". Had a lot of usage of the word "scream", but was changed for being too non-clinical. Wasn't confident that the document revisions would do well, but it's still up. PoI-2919 doesn't remember his art piece anymore.
> 
> **Fun Fact:** One of my old classmates had the surname Zannis.

> = **SCP-4350**
> 
> Sixth article. Came up with it while stuck in traffic, posted it two days later. Vehicle involved is Mitsubishi Galant because of its rarity and quirky existence. Any relations to [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1218 SCP-1218] is purely coincidental. Choudhury still drives his rental car, he never got his old one back.
> 
> **Fun Fact:** Received the [[*user pxdnbluesoul]] Reluctant Seal of Approval in the Week 13 Recap SCP Cafe Podcast.

> I don't know him very well, so I really can't say anything about him.
> [[>]]
> -Dr. Victoria Vomac
> [[/>]]

> Oh, him? Honestly, the less you know, the better.
> [[>]]
> -Dr. Franklin Ficarra
> [[/>]]

> Back when I used to work at Site-48, with the classic car, he was known as "that guy", you know? He didn't do much, but when he did anything, he did it right the first time.
> [[>]]
> -Dr. Bradson Boudames
> [[/>]]

> Guy's not good at decisions. I saw him look at my SUV, and I offered to sell it to him. He said that he would think about it, so I was surprised when I saw him drive up in this economy sedan a few days later. He bragged to me about how cheap he got his Hyundai Excel, when he could've bought my Explorer for two-thirds of the price! Some people just don't know how to decide for themselves.
> [[>]]
> -Dr. Gary Gleason
> [[/>]]

> I don't know what he does here. I've never seen his credentials, but he seems to have a high enough clearance to access anything in Site-56. He can't be the Site Director, that's Palermo, but he can't be a janitor, either.
> [[>]]
> -Researcher Sharon Sheffield
> [[/>]]

> He sleeps at his desk all day. I've never seen him do any sort of work around here. I think he hires a D-Class to do his paperwork for him. We may not deal with the most dangerous anomalies around here, but his work "ethic" is still unprofessional.
> [[>]]
> -Researcher Terrance Tsai
> [[/>]]

> I remember when I kept hearing that damn screaming noise everywhere, and he communicated with me by writing notes and giving the messages to me. That was after the phase where he would scream into my ears about where the bathrooms were for the fiftieth time.

> -Researcher Samuel Celi

> = To ███ ███,

> = Your audition is complete.

> = Please do not come again. Please. We beg you.
> 
> = //- Keep Brighton Functioning Committee//

> Sometimes, he would talk about our high school years with nostalgia, even though, well, maybe I shouldn't say. 
> [[>]]
> -Officer Nathanial Neves
> [[/>]]

> I love when he's around! Every day he comes by, he puts Researcher Donahue in his place, which is hard to do, cause Donahue is an irresponsible party animal. I know that this level of unprofessionalism is frowned upon these days, but ███'s still good at breaking the ice.

> He likes to call me "Triple A" sometimes. Dick.
