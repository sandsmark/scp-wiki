I don't know him very well, so I really can't say anything about him.

I don't know what he does here. I've never seen his credentials, but he seems to have a high enough clearance to access anything in Site-56. He can't be the Site Director, that's Palermo, but he can't be a janitor, either.

He sleeps at his desk all day. I've never seen him do any sort of work around here. I think he hires a D-Class to do his paperwork for him. We may not deal with the most dangerous anomalies around here, but his work "ethic" is still unprofessional.

I love when he's around! Every day he comes by, he puts Researcher Donahue in his place, which is hard to do, cause Donahue is an irresponsible party animal. I know that this level of unprofessionalism is frowned upon these days, but ███'s still good at breaking the ice.
