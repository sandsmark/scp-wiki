[[include component:image-block name=SCP-4951-1|caption=SCP-4951-1 in an unpowered state.]]

**Item #:** SCP-4951

**Object Class:** Keter / Thaumiel

**Special Containment Procedures:** All physical components of SCP-4951-1 are to remain contained in a powered state with unfiltered internet connectivity.

 Foundation assets are to maintain no less than 51% stock share in any publicly traded corporation created by SCP-4951.  

All proposed insurance policies generated by SCP-4951 are to be immediately sealed, and delivered in their entirety to Overwatch command.

**Description:** SCP-4951 is a self-propagating digital cloud-based entity capable of writing portions of itself on any operating system to which it is exposed.  At time of writing, 186 such devices are in containment, collectively designated SCP-4951-1.

[[include component:image-block name=SCP-4951-2|caption=SCP-4951-2 in an unpowered state.]]

Based on available information, SCP-4951 is believed to be the digitized consciousness of Horatio Avelar.[[footnote]]Co-founder of Avelar Professional Products Inc.  Reported missing, presumed dead November 23, 1971[[/footnote]]  By the account of SCP-4951, components of SCP-4951-1 within Foundation custody account for roughly 0.085% of all such devices hosting a portion of its consciousness worldwide.  

SCP-4951 utilizes the combined computing power of its component parts in order to predict future anomalous activity.  It utilizes this information to open shell corporations with the sole function of selling insurance policies covering very specific anomalous activities.  Insurance policies generated in this way have proven successful in predicting anomalous activity and assisting with subsequent containment in 89% of cases.[[footnote]]Roughly 8% of all generated policies fail to link to any actual anomalous phenomena.
