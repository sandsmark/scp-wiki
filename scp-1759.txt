**Item #:** SCP-1759

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1759 is to be locked in its guarded hangar at all time. Hangar is monitored remotely to prevent possible contact.

**Description:** SCP-1759 is a 1942 Douglas A-20 Havoc bomber aircraft. Painted on the left side of the plane is a blonde figure bearing the name "Lovely Lucy" written below her. The aircraft flew 8 bombing mission over its three years of combat service. Across these missions, a total of 9 soldiers were killed by enemy aircraft fire. The plane was naturally retired after the war.

SCP-1759 displays its unusual effect when an individual makes contact with the "Lovely Lucy" artwork. The individual will become unresponsive for several seconds, then appear to begin weeping. After this emotional response, they will demand they be allowed to pilot the plane.

Despite most lacking any previous piloting experience, the affected individual displays sudden knowledge of basic takeoff and flight procedures. The aircraft will take off from the landing strip, typically flying a total of 10 to 20 miles.

After this distance, the plane will return to the hangar. The affected pilot has yet to return alive. Upon return, they are discovered with seemingly spontaneous wounds matching the impact of a bullet. Examination of the deceased has identified them as matching the wounds produced from WW2 era German fighter planes. The cause of these wound is as of yet, unknown.
