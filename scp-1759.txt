title:SCP-1759
**Item #:** SCP-1759

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1759 is to be locked in its small guarded hangar at all time. Hangar is monitored remotely to prevent possible contact.

**Description:** SCP-1759 is a 2002 Cessna 172S airplane. The plane is painted with an old fashioned pin-up on the side. A blonde woman with the words "Lovely Lucy" above and below her.

SCP-1759 displays its unusual effect when an individual makes contact with the "Lovely Lucy" artwork. The individual(Regardless of gender or sexual orientation) will become enamored with the artwork, and demand they be allowed to pilot the plane. 

Despite most lacking any previous piloting experience, the affected individual displays sudden knowledge of basic takeoff and flight procedures. The aircraft will hover in a simple circle above the area for 5 to 9 minutes. The pilots thus far have made no attempt to leave the general area.

After no less than 5 and no more than 9 minutes, SCP-1759 will return to the hangar, minus the pilot. What happens to the pilots is at this time, unknown.
