**Item #:** SCP-1759

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1759 is to be locked in its guarded hangar at all time. Hangar is monitored remotely to prevent possible contact.

**Description:** SCP-1759 is a 1942 Douglas A-20 Havoc bomber aircraft. Painted on the left side of the plane is a blonde figure bearing the name "Lovely Lucy" written below her. The aircraft flew 8 bombing missions over its three years of combat service. Across these missions, a total of 9 soldiers were killed by enemy aircraft fire. The plane was naturally retired after the war.

SCP-1759 displays its unusual effect when an individual makes contact with the "Lovely Lucy" artwork. The individual will become unresponsive for several seconds, then appear to begin weeping. After this emotional response, they will demand they be allowed to pilot the plane.

Despite most lacking any previous piloting experience, the affected individual displays sudden knowledge of basic takeoff and flight procedures. The aircraft will take off from the landing strip, typically flying a total of 10 to 20 miles.

Video and audio monitoring have recorded the pilot entering an almost ecstatic state when in flight. After 5 miles, their mood will become solemn and serious. Mile 10 tends to produce anger. 15 results in a repeat of the weeping state experienced during initial contact. Upon drawing close to mile 20, the subject will remove audio monitoring equipment and obscure the camera in the cockpit. Stating "Lucy doesn't want this to be recorded". 

Throughout all of these states, the pilot appears to be talking to themselves. They are possibly communicating with SCP-1759.

After this distance, the plane will return to the hangar. The affected pilot has yet to return alive. Upon return, they are discovered with seemingly spontaneous wounds matching the impact of a bullet. Examination of the deceased has identified them as matching the wounds produced from WW2 era German fighter planes. The cause of these wound is as of yet, unknown.

**Addendum:** Observation of SCP-1759 after flight has brought a series of tally marks on the right side to our attention. SCP-1759 appears to be keeping count of its occupants.

**Addendum 2:** Routine remote monitoring has detected unidentified noise the night after D-9002's flight. Appears to be the sound of a woman weeping. Noise ceased the next day.
