[[*user MalyceGraves]] said "A heart o' gold with a fine set of pipes."

[[*user Calibri_Bold]] said "Full is an 8/10 person. Doesn't smell awful, wears glasses, but isn't a wizard."

[[*user Tropinano]] said "One time I walked into the site19 and there stood Fullham in the biggest fucking hat you've ever seen. I was in shock and said 'where did you get that hat' but was quickly hushed as DrFullham stared at me, looked around hastily and vanished."

[[*user Proasek]] said "The more I read from Fullham the more I want die."

[[*user cybersqyd]] said "Doctor Fullham is, despite my strongest protests, an author."

> This was my first ever SCP, and it took me ages to write. The earliest drafts were a sad ripoff of [[[SCP-093 | SCP-093]]] and people were quick to tell me such. After two years of editing and polishing, it was finally to a point where I felt comfortable posting it in the fall of 2018. 
> 
> As of 21/06/2020, I have done a fairly major rewrite and shaved off about 1500 words thanks to the lovely [[*user cybersqyd]]. Ve helped me trim the fat and cut out a lot of stuff that didn't really help the narrative, and for that ve has my eternal gratitude. [[*user MalyceGraves]]'s advice also prompted me to remove every single blackbox on the page. 

I also had this lovely image impromptu-drawn for me by the amazing [[*user Skorpt]]!!! I appreciate it so much and love how well they got across a complex idea in such a straightforward image! [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/what-s-an-art-style-skorpt-s-art-page You can find her art page here!]

> What is and will probably remain my most emotional SCP. It's based on the fact that I really love my mom who is thankfully still with us. Wrote this in about two months after the first time I graced the IRC chats with my presence.

Artist [[*user Aethris]] also drew this incredible GIF of 4836, again, without me even asking! The artists here are so heckin' great and generous! [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/aethris-art You can find her art page here!]

> My first entry for 144-hour Jamcon 2020, the theme was **EXPLOSIONS**. I stared at my signed photo of Mr. Torgue for inspiration as I wrote it. It's both my shortest SCP and the shortest time I've spent writing an SCP, 6-8 hours total. And since you foolish fools foolishy voted to keep it on the site, now this page exists.
