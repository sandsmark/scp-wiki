[[[SCP-3608 | The Living Dimension]]]

> This was my first ever SCP, and it took me ages to write. The earliest drafts were a sad ripoff of [[[SCP-093 | SCP-093]]] and people were quick to tell me such. After two years of editing and polishing, it was finally to a point where I felt comfortable posting it in the fall of 2018. 

[[[SCP-4836 | I Love You Beary Much]]]

> What is and will probably remain my most emotional SCP. It's based on the fact that I really love my mom who is thankfully still with us. Wrote this in about two months after the first time I graced the IRC chats with my presence.

[[[SCP-5836 | To Nobel Peace You Must Prepare For War]]]

> My first entry for 144-hour Jamcon 2020, the theme was **EXPLOSIONS**. I stared at my signed photo of Mr. Torgue for inspiration as I wrote it. It's both my shortest SCP and the shortest time I've spent writing an SCP, 6-8 hours total. And since you foolish fools foolishy voted to keep it on the site, now this page exists.

> I hope you all learn from your mistake.
