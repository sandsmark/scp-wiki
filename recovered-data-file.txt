We don't have the tools for this anymore, and we're not sure if we ever really did. We can't assume that we really knew anything we thought we knew. That isn't a metaphor. We have to question whether that knowledge ever really existed, or if th[DATA CORRUPT] "restructured" too. Think about it, really //think// about all the thing we take for granted as part of "reality". The food we eat, the air we breathe, the things we think. We could wake up in twelve hours in a world where religion as we know it doesn't even[DATA CORRUPT] God help us all. If God still exists anymore.

I am confident that w[DATA CORRUPT] born in a stable, in a feeding trough. Yes, how low we've sunk. But the activity amongst the locals has been extremely strange.

Yes, we got her out beforehand, but does that rea[DATA CORRUPT]question what we're doing here? Hundreds of infants have been killed and whether we swung the swords or not, it's our fault.

Is he a side effect of a previous CK-class event? At this stage we have no way of knowing the difference. The more important questions are: Should we take him seriously, and is he working with us or against us?

It's not as if she's invincible, whatever she seems to think, and these "miracles", while an excellent tool for attracting attention, are a tool that cuts both ways. They get us all the results we need in the short term, but in the long te[DATA CORRUPT]cannot stress enough that we need to //remember the Herod incident//. What happens if these people turn on us? What happens if they try to kill her? What happens if they succeed?

She bled out for hours nailed to that tree and they stabbed her in the side and buried her - and she was dead, mark my words, for three whole days - and //she's alive//.  I can't believe any of this is really happening. Actually, that's a lie. I think I'm beyond disbelief at this point. Three days dead a[DATA CORRUPT]an't be a random side effect of the CK-class events.
