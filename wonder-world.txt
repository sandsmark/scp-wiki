@@ @@
This isn't 100% about Dr. Wondertainment, which may come as a surprise. Certainly that's the Foundation (ha ha) of everything here, but it's not really the full picture. But let's start there.

This canon is mainly set in the anomalous city of Wonder World!™, which does indeed exist on earth as an extradimensional space somewhere in Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America. Wonder World!™ is host, of course, to the company of Dr. Wondertainment, and to a large population (I mean, think medium sized city) of magical, Wondrous people. The culture is built on childlike innocence, willing naivety, whimsy, and a deep appreciation for the goodness that can be found in each and every person.

But of course, nothing's perfect.

What a Wonderful World is not about ignoring the dark, disturbing, horribly effed up world that is the Foundationverse. It's about finding reasons to be happy and pushing through in spite of that. One person may look at a Wonder World!™ denizen and call them "in denial". Another may call them "optimistic". It all depends on interpretation.

Some key points about this canon's Dr. Wondertainment:
* The goal of the company is, truly, to make child's lives more magical.
* If there is anything shady going on at Wondertainment, it is under the nose of upper management.
* Dr. Wondertainment is a title. Each Dr. Wondertainment chooses the next Dr. Wondertainment, with the approval of a committee made of the heads of all departments. The title itself may or may not have some magical effect on the bearer.
* Dr. Wondertainment has multiple departments. The most famous of which is the Toy Creation Department, but there are also notably the Sweets & Consumables Department, the Construction Department, the Public & Human Relations Department, etc.. All of which have cutesy names, such as the employees of the Sweets & Consumables Department being called Candy Catalysts.
* Dr. Wondertainment was founded in 1909 by Chester Williams (the original Dr. Wondertainment) and Maria Herring (the original Toy Tinker). The first store was in Boston, and was called Dr. Wondertainment's World of Whimsy.
* The Misters are handled very differently.

That's about all the information I am willing to fit into this introduction. If you're really hoping to write for the canon, or get a good understanding of it, then I would simply recommend you to read some of the articles available. Oh, and speaking of "read some of the articles", below are some good intro articles for people wishing to write for What a Wonderful World. If you have any questions or just want to chat with the authors, you can catch us at #wonderworld over on IRC.

 Enjoy the canon!

: [[span style="font-family: 'Berkshire Swash', cursive;"]]**[[[What a Wonderful World|And I Think To Myself...]]]**[[/span]] //by DarkStuff// : "And I Think To Myself... is 10,000 words worth of crafted Wonder World!™ worldbuilding. If you have a question on how a part of the world works, and you haven't read this, read this and see if you have that question afterwards. Be wary! Using the navigation at the bottom will put you smack in the middle of the Vend-a-Friend story, and you will likely be lost unless you've already read the series."

: [[span style="font-family: 'Berkshire Swash', cursive;"]]**[[[City of Wonder™]]]**[[/span]] //by DrChandra// : "City of Wonder™ is another author's more concise image of Wonder World!™, and thus another good look at the setting of the canon. While And I Think To Myself... is based on a local's perspective of Wonder World!™, City of Wonder™ is focused on an outsider's perspective, which may be equally useful for writing the canon / deeper reading."

: **[[span style="font-family: 'Berkshire Swash', cursive;"]][[[Wonder World Dossier]]]**[[/span]] //by Uncle Nicolini// : "Wonder World Dossier is a summation of Wonder World!™ through the eyes of the Foundation. If you were ever curious as to what exactly the Foundation knows about Wonder World!™, its culture, and the inner workings of the company, look no further."

[[SIZE 120%]][[span style="font-family: 'Berkshire Swash', cursive;"]]**An Origin Story:**[[/span]][[/size]]

Below is the origin story for Wonder World!™. At the time of writing, no tales have been written about this origin story, but I feel it best to specify so that people writing for What a Wonderful World can make sure not to interfere with the origin story. For any interested, here's where the canon came from:

 __[[span style="font-family: 'Berkshire Swash', cursive;"]]"The Story of Chester Williams & Maria Herring"[[/span]]__
[[/=]]
* Chester Williams is the original Dr. Wondertainment. He is a non-anomalous thirty-two-year-old black man in Boston in 1909 when he founds Dr. Wondertainment (as Dr. Wondertainment's World of Whimsy).
* Maria Herring is a magical woman who quickly joins Dr. Wondertainment and makes the first //actually// magic stuff. Chester remains the face of the company, but Maria is what helps makes it special.
* The shop exists in a little back alley because it's the only place that Chester could ever afford, but as its magical nature becomes (somewhat) known, business actually picks up. Strangely enough, it's not usually children asking for stuff.
* Place slowly grows, and at some point, they get approached and warned that "magic stuff doesn't last long when it gets big, you need to figure out how to keep low". Eventually, this leads to an extradimensional real estate agent selling them a space that they can put in the back of their shop. This starts as an expansion of the store, and then it becomes a place that people can take a Way to, which becomes more popular of a way to meet them than finding them in Boston (where they hope to lay low, they change their name and everything).
* This extradimensional space eventually, over a //long// time, expands, and becomes Wonder World. This happens as they make bunks for people they recruit as toymakers, and eventually, they get powerful enough to expand the space themselves. It becomes a haven for Dr. Wondertainment employees, and eventually just weird (and Wondrous) people who wish to hold onto their childhood innocence before the world shoved them into the hell that is being anomalous against the GOC and SCP.

@@ @@
The [[[Dread Circuses Hub|Dread & Circuses]]] canon and this canon do //not// perfectly coexist. Some of the articles do cross over into the other canon. However! Only articles tagged with "wonderful-world" are canon here. You can imagine that Icky and Manny exist, that Iris Dark exists, that Icky and Manny took over the Circus from an overbearing Herman Fuller, but how Marshall, Carter & Dark //work// may be different, the Group of Interest relationships are likely to be revised, etc.. Assume that everything tagged "dread&circuses" works within that canon, and everything tagged "wonderful-world" works within this canon, and there will be overlap, but they are not the same.

And, yes, this rule extends to //all// canon crossovers, which will most certainly happen later.
