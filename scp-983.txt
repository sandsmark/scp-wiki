title:SCP-983
**Item #:** SCP-983

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:**  SCP-983 is completely safe so long as technicians handling it do so on any day other than their birthday. Should SCP-983 be presented to or handled by any individual on the yearly anniversary of their birth they should immediately follow the sing-along guidelines contained in Emergency Kit 135r located next to the door to SCP-983’s containment chamber.

 In the event the targeted individual fails to meet sing-along requirements their remains are to be disposed of through standard methods. In the event the targeted individual meets the sing-along requirements the following pieces of data are to be collected: Age, Color of Candy collected, Singing Accuracy obtained by best the judgment of those present, and the number of verses that passed before acknowledgement by SCP-983.

No candy obtained from SCP-983 is to be consumed by any staff without senior staff approved containment procedures in place and written waivers filed and stamped by the consumer. This requirement is waived in the case of Class-D candy testing.

**Description:** SCP-983 is a vintage mechanical monkey with a faded date located on the bottom of the left foot placing its manufacture at some point in the 1940s by an unknown person or company. The monkey is dressed in the remains of what used to be a popular vest design for circus ringmasters. In the monkey’s left hand it holds a lightly tarnished brass bell. In the right hand the monkey holds a small brass striking rod. The monkey is capable of emitting speech and sound although examination of the object has revealed no seams, screws, or openings that would indicate a method of disassembly.

SCP-983 is completely harmless and inert under most circumstances and may be handled without special precautions so long as the handler is not experiencing the 24 hour period considered the anniversary of his birth. Once SCP-983 physically comes into contact with an individual on their birthday it will spring to life and do a single back flip before raising its bell and singing a simple hymn.

//A RING DING DING DING IT’S YOUR BIRTHDAY!//

This single verse will be followed by the monkey striking its bell producing a tone that varies in pitch from quite high to rather low. SCP-983’s singing was found to vary slightly in pitch as well but maintained a very excited and happy tone. 

SCP-983 will sing this hymn once every three to four seconds, pausing only to ring its bell, until the new owner has passed away or met the sing-along requirements which as of yet are not completely understood but are believed to be based in timing the sing-along properly with SCP-983.

Each verse sung by SCP-983 appears to age the ‘owner’ of the item by what is estimated at one year. By singing along with SCP-983 the ‘owner’ may deactivate the monkey which once done successfully results in a triumphant declaration of //’BIRTHDAY!’// from SCP-983 at which time it will ring its bell once and produce a single gum-drop style candy from the bell.

The approach of singing along with SCP-983 has a direct impact on the color of the candy and the side effects of its consumption. Test groups instructed to follow Document 135r to the letter have verified that a perfect sing-along results in the production of a crystal clear candy with mildly luminescent qualities. A near-perfect sing-along produces the same candy minus the luminesecene. Both of these candy types have been verified as restoring any lost age to the consumer due to SCP-983’s song however the luminescent candy may also grant additional time and youth but as of yet this theory is unproven due to the low production rate of this candy.

Due to the inconsistancies in attitude, tone, behavior, and approach when trying to match SCP-983’s song a wide variety of candies have been produced. Under absolutely no circumstances are black candies allowed to be consumed however other colors may be consumed pending prior approval and containment arrangements.

The initial activation of SCP-983 was in a highly uncontrolled environment so a ‘retelling’ is the best record available of the incident. Subsequent tests of interest in more controlled environments have been attached to this document as well as candy effects for those experiments.

||**SCP-983 First Activation**||

SCP-983 was purchased from a local flea market intended as a gift for a monkey admirer as a joke. The seller of the monkey warned the purchaser that it was to be seen and never touched by anyone on the day of their birth but was unable to give exact reasons why, stating it was a warning passed to them that was well observed and may have been ‘Gypsy legend or some other bull****.’

Upon the birthday of SCP-983’s intended new owner the gift was unwrapped and the monkey handled at which point it sprang into song. Staff attending the birthday party of their coworker were amused as was the recipient at first, however witnesses state the recipient became more and more agitated the longer the monkey sang.

After ten estimated verses the recipient tried to find a way to turn the device off to no avail. Attendees state that at this time several persons noted streaks of silver within the recepient’s hair. Following an estimated 8 to 10 more verses from SCP-983 the grey was quite pronounced as were signs of wrinkling or stress on the recipient’s face. Within five more verses the recipient returned the monkey to rest and complained of not having the strength to deal with this nonsense, pleading for someone to turn it off.

With SCP-983 not being fully realized as a potentially dangerous object there was panic and sloth in the reactions of the attending staff which led to SCP-983 being able to complete what can only be estimated at thirty or perhaps fourty more verses before a containment crew could arrive at the party locale. By this point the recepient had long since expired due to aging, leaving only a skeletal frame remaining in his chair with the skin clinging to it.

With confusion on how to approach SCP-983 safely it was allowed to sing for roughly another minute before it ceased of its own accord at which point nothing remained of the original recepient other than his purely skeletal remains. SCP-983's final verse consisted of the single word, “//BIRTHDAY!//”, which it announced joyously before doing a single backflip and ringing its bell once. From the bell fell a single candy resembling a gum drop pure black in color. This candy was never consumed and was described as being moderately entrancing, drawing a persons gaze into it until an outside source distracted them. With a number of individuals at the scene and the general chaos involving the incident no single person was able to become too focused on the candy and it was safely contained.
