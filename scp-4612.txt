**Special Containment Procedures**: Due to extreme difficulty relocating SCP-4612-A, a perimeter maintained by a barbed wire fence has been established around Provisional Site-91.  Any unauthorized individuals found at Provisional Site-91 are to be interrogated for any possible connection to [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/serpent-s-hand-hub | Group of Interest ALPHA-019]]] ("Serpent's Hand").  Members of the Serpents Hand are to be processed by the Ethics Committee.

SCP-4612-B is uncontained at this time, as its whereabouts are unknown.  Foundation webcrawler I/O METATRON is to scrub all social media and internet postings for mentions of a figure fitting description of SCP-4612-B.  Mobile Task Force Beta-777 (“Hecate’s Spear”) are to be notified of sightings of SCP-4612-B.

**Description**:  SCP-4612 refers to two related anomalies. SCP-4612-A is the body a large limaciform invertebrate, consisting of white translucent flesh with elastic texture.  The body shows no sign of decay despite centuries having passed since estimated time of death.  The cadaver is ten meters in length, one meter in width, and lying atop a stone altar.    The cadaver’s anatomy includes six human arms 3 meters in length.  Each arm terminates at a hand with ten digits and a crystal structure in the palm.  A long, flexible fin travels down the length of SCP-4612-A.  

There is a lengthwise, posthumously executed incision along the underside of the cadaver.  The cadaver’s blood is of bright blue hue and has not coagulated.  Additionally, the cadaver emits considerable amounts of [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/spikebrennan-s-proposal | Akiva radiation]]].[[footnote]] Physically quantifiable measurement of the prime thaumaturgical force.  Controversially referred to as evidence of “Divine Grace.”[[/footnote]] The cadaver has emitted a steady increase in its radiation for unknown reasons since its discovery.

SCP-4612-A is housed in an underground structure beneath Provisional Site-91, an 18th Century manor in Yorkshire, England, commonly referred to as Eckhart House.  The door to the vault is located on the exterior of Eckhart House and leads to an underground structure beneath the wine cellar.  The door is inscribed with thaumaturgical glyphs which, at one time, induced a mild cognitohazard causing the viewer to ignore the entryway.  

The underground structure which houses SCP-4612-A is constructed of stone blocks, many of which are charred and warped from heat.  Cuneiform glyphs of unknown thaumaturgical purpose are etched onto the surface of many of the stone blocks.  

SCP-4612-B is a humanoid entity 1.75 meters tall of average build, with eyes that glow a bright blue.  SCP-4612-B has demonstrated the ability to manipulate thermal energy and exhibited anomalous strength far beyond what is expected given its height and build.    SCP-4612-B has referred to SCP-4612-A as its father, despite being two distinct species.  See __Incident 4612-1__.

**RE**: Concerning the origins and significance of SCP-4612-A

> From what historical references we have gathered, there have been numerous events categorized as a backsliding of technological capabilities of human cultures through history.  Many of these instances have grounded explanations by historians, but some do not.
>
> What many of these occurrences include are firsthand accounts or pieces of folklore that reference an appearance of an entity matching description of SCP-4612-A.  The following is a short sample of recorded appearances by SCP-4612-A in the historical record.
>
> ||~ Event of Interference ||~ Time period ||~ Evidence/commentary ||
> || Decline of Sumer || 25,000 B.C.E || Renditions of SCP-4612-A were on early Sumerian pottery shards, inviting speculation RE: interference of the entity in Sumerian culture, raising questions about the end of that culture’s dominance in the area. ||
> || Late Bronze Age Collapse || circa 1100 B.C.E. || After the great conflict between [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/church-of-the-broken-god-hub | Mekhanite]]] culture and [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/sarkicism-hub | Sarkic]]] forces in the Bronze Age Mediterranean area, most of the fabled technology of those who follow the Broken God vanished instead of affecting the progress bronze age technologies.  SCP-4612-A matches the description of ancient scrolls apparently written by a Mekhanite priest circa 1000 B.C.E. previously interpreted to be a mythical representation of Sarkic bioforms. ||
> || Decline of Daveite Culture || circa 200 B.C.E. || As is discussed in [[[SCP-140]]], the culture of the Daevites vanished after being defeated by Chinese forces.  Archaeological digs have revealed murals at a Daevite ritual site dating to this period depicting a creature that can be interpreted to be SCP-4612-A, again raising the question of the entity's involvement with that culture's end. ||
> || Dark Ages Europe || 400-800 C.E. || After the fall of Roman society, European societies abandoned much of the technological advances of Rome, including aqueduct architecture and roads.  Given the shift to Christianity and the abandonment of “Pagan” ideas/values, this has always been laid at the feet of religious propaganda.  Recent historical documents originating in a monastery at Lindisfarne describe a demonic creature matching the description of SCP-4612-A appearing in the year 412 C.E. ||
> || Black Death || 1347-1352 C.E. || Journal entries found in a burial site from the period in Sicily describe visitation of a spirit causing outbreaks of black plague in the surrounding area.  The spirit described matches the appearance of SCP-4612-A.||
> Based on the above information, it is an Alpha priority that Foundation personnel catalog any other examples of SCP-4612-A's species.  If even half of the above instances of SCP-4612-A's interference are factual, this entity has had a significant impact on human history across many cultures.

**Discovery**:
SCP-4612-A was discovered on December 19, 1986 when Foundation agents surveilling a known member of the Serpent’s Hand (designated as POI-39978K) followed POI-39978K onto the grounds of Eckhart House.   Agents observed POI-39978K perform an unknown thaumaturgical ritual and enter the door to underground structure housing SCP-4612-A.  The agents then pursued and witnessed POI-39978K kneeling before the remains, weeping.  Upon seeing SCP-4612-A, Foundation agents detained POI-39978K and called for reinforcements.

MTF-Beta-777 mobilized from Site-06-03, arriving roughly 8 hours after Foundation personnel reported the anomaly.  MTF-Beta-777 are specially trained in thaumaturgical countermeasures and always staffed with at least two Class-A thaumatologists.  MTF personnel were accompanied by Agent Rebekah Douglas, Senior Researcher and Level-3 psychometrist.[[footnote]]Ability to make relevant associations from an object of unknown history by making physical contact with that object.  Individuals assessed by Psionics Division as Level-3 Psychometry can read surface emotions and history from individuals they touch.[[/footnote]]

Survey of the site revealed no obvious anomalies other than the cadaver of SCP-4612-A.  The corpses of 23 human males of various ages were found surrounding SCP-4612-A.  Most of the corpses were significantly charred and had warped skeletal structures due to exposure to significant heat.  Several of the corpses were dismembered due to blunt force trauma. Agent Douglas noted significant psychic trauma present in all human remains on site.

**__Historical Context__**

The individual referenced by POI-39978K is believed to be William Henry Eckhart, initial owner and resident master of Eckhart House.   Eckhart was an active member in several occult societies and held regular meetings of such societies at his home.

Eckhart made his fortune mining iron and copper.  Local historians have theorized that he was investing in the burgeoning movement towards industrial revolution.

Records from the Yorkshire Historical Society mention a “meteor strike” occurring on the evening of September 17, 1779, causing significant damage to the House. The structure does not currently exhibit damage commensurate with such an event.  Mr. Eckhart was last seen by his servants entering his library on the morning of the meteor strike and was considered dead after the incident.  No mention of the underground structure or SCP-4612-A are made in the historical record.  Local legends note that a man made of fire was seen walking out of the ruined house after the impact.[[footnote]]It is theorized that SCP-4612-B was the cause of this event.  See __Incident 4612-1__.[[/footnote]]

**Examination of SCP-4612-A**
//Attempts to move SCP-4612-A have been unsuccessful.  The corpse exhibits density far beyond what is to be expected by cursory examination, estimated to weigh over 26,000 kg.  The altar where the body lies is assessed as anomalous given its ability to hold the body without losing structural integrity.  Dr. Varga has decided that attempting to move the corpse would not nearly be as cost effective as testing on site.  It is for this reason that Provisional Site-91 was established.//

[[collapsible hideLocation="both" show="▷ Physical Examination of SCP-4612-A – LEVEL 4/4612 CLASSIFIED." hide="▽ Access Granted"]]

//Small samples were surgically removed from SCP-4612-A for ease of testing.//

**__Genetic profiling__**: SCP-4612-A has a cellular structure not matching any entries throughout the Foundation’s biological databases; the cellular structure is made up of a blending of carbon and silicate.

**__Exposure to various elements__**: The sample was exposed to electrical current of various charges, alpha, gamma and ultraviolet radiations.  The sample showed no change in its state, absorbing electrical current and radiations noted without sign of degradation or decay.  Visible wavelengths of light (in addition to infrared) are not absorbed, but produce rippling motion in the structure of the fin running along SCP-4612-A’s length.

Residual energies exposed to the sample of SCP-4612-A's flesh have been observed emitting from the crystalline structures present in its hands.  Transmittal of energies from sample to cadaver occur instantaneously.  It is theorized the crystalline structures were used to conduct energies in an unknown process.  

The lengthwise incision along SCP-4612-A’s body emits significantly higher Akiva radiation than the rest of the body.  The ritual or surgical procedure was apparently interrupted, as indicated by the bloodied palm prints along the length of the body.  It's theorized that the corpse was to be used in a thaumaturgical ritual of unknown purpose.

X-ray imaging of SCP-4612-A is impossible, as the remains absorb radiation.  Ultrasound examination and portable MRI scans have shown a complete lack of internal organs.  SCP-4612-A is made of fibrous muscle structures and a vast nervous system with nodules of unknown utility.

Agent Douglas spent 5 weeks in recuperation.  In that time, she was rarely conscious.  A figure resembling SCP-4612-B was seen entering Douglas’ room on video surveillance 36 days after her collapse.  Security staff was mobilized and sent to Douglas’ recuperation quarters, but there was no sign of SCP-4612-B.  When security staff approached Agent Douglas, she was alert but had a thumbprint on her forehead just above the bridge of her nose.  Medical personnel were unable to clean the mark from her skin.

During debriefing, Douglas was asked to recount any discussion with SCP-4612-B prior to arrival of security staff.  Douglas reported that SCP-4612-B claimed she was only alive because she was merely investigating.  Additionally, Agent Douglas claimed significant interference of her psychometry, as all she could sense were the following words being repeated: “Eckhart died for a reason.”
