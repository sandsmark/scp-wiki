**Item #:** SCP-273

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-273 is held in an enclosure 5m x 10m in size, half of which is closed off for the subject's privacy. All major structural and facing materials of the cell are of fireproof and non-thermally-conductive materials. A bedroll and other modest furnishings are allowed, provided they remain in the private section, and that all consumption of food be performed in the adjacent area.

All windows from the observation room into the enclosure are composed of heat-treated glass of at least 1 cm total thickness, with an insulated gap in between. Heat and infrared sensors in both enclosure and observation are set to produce an alarm if any temperature exceeds 50 degrees Celsius. Observing staff are required to evacuate the room in such an event.

Food in the form of raw meat must be provided, at least 5 kg per day, in two sessions, for consumption. Other foods may be provided to SCP-273's request, provided good behavior continues. All clothing provided to SCP-273 must be either flame-resistant in nature, or be of inexpensive make and fabrics.

SCP-273 is not to be interacted with in person if she has not consumed a meal of raw meat of at least 2.5 kg mass within the last 12 hours.

In light of Incident 273-02, alcoholic beverages in excess of 50% alcohol by volume must not be provided to SCP-273, nor should any other flame accelerants be provided. All staff interacting with SCP-273 must be armed with non-lethal defense measures. Lethal force should not be used.

**Description:** SCP-273 resembles a middle-aged woman of Indian descent, the only unusual feature of which is her complete lack of body hair. SCP-273 is fluent in a large number of different languages, including English, Hindi, Spanish, [DATA EXPUNGED]s theorized to be a proto-Sinitic langauge. Her memories show exceptional recall, with the exception of periods prior to [DATA EXPUNGED]

While she reportedly enjoys certain foods, she feels no need to eat or drink. Instead, she consumes matter through a form of combustion at a distance. This method of combustion normally produces no visible flames, instead oxidizing the subject from the outside in, so long as it remains within her line of sight. The waste matter produced consists of a fine white ash, as well as any metal impurities in organic matter. She is apparently limited to consuming organic matter, except under special circumstances (see Incident Report 273-03).

Her consumption ability demonstrates a preference for meat over other organic matter. The order of preference is, in ascending order, cooked meat, raw meat, and living prey. The extreme rate of consumption demonstrated in the death of [DATA EXPUNGED] indicate a preference for human prey.

DNA samples and medical tests indicate she is normal in all respects, despite these abnormalities. SCP-273 also claims not to have any conscious control over her remote combustion ability, only the ability to know when she is "hungry." No tests to ascertain her honesty in this show any signs of fabrication, and she has demonstrated extreme distress both during and long periods after any feeding session involving human subjects.

In the event of SCP-273's death, her body becomes the center of a large conflagration, marked by a central pillar of approximately one meter in width and extending far upwards. After the initial flames subside, all that remains of SCP-273's body is a pile of white ash, similar to her combustion waste, with the exception of a faint blue flame from within the pile.

Over the course of several hours, her body slowly reforms from the ash pile by consuming any source of raw material nearby, including the surrounding air. In this state, slow consumption of inorganic material has been observed. The new body resembles the old in all ways, with no signs of injury or illness. When her body is completely reformed, she awakens, with no memory of events after her recent death.

**Incident Report 273-01**
**Date:** ██/██/████
**Location:** [DATA EXPUNGED]

SCP-273 received reports of a thin pillar of flame exceeding 70m in height, and resulting wildfires, witnessed in the vicinity of ████████████████ Due to the anomalous shape and duration of the flame, a small MTF was dispatched to the location.

Upon initial contact, SCP-273 was found unclothed and covered in white ash, prone at the point of origin of the fires. Bodies of two deceased caucasians, one male one female, were found nearby, the cause of death later determined to be severe 3rd degree burns. Upon rising, she yelled at agents not to come near and fled deeper into the forest, past the flames. Subject was found 15 minutes later, standing over a deer carcass, which radiated anomalous amounts of heat. Carcass crumbled to ash and coals at a touch. SCP-273 was unusually cooperative at this juncture, claiming she was "better now that [she had] eaten."

SCP-273 was then offered a medical gown and transported to Site ██ for evaluation and containment.

**Partial Transcript of Interview with SCP-273:**
**Interviewer:** Dr. ████.
**Foreword:** SCP-273 had been obtained the day prior and introduced to her temporary holding cell in Site ██. A video camera situated behind Dr. ████ provided visual records of the interview. SCP-273 was first led to believe she was being held for questioning.

> **Dr. ████:** 273, do you know why you are here?
> [SCP-273 does not respond or make eye contact, remaining in fetal position against the back wall of her enclosure.]
> **Dr. ████:** You are likely to be charged with arson and destruction of property in excess of $█████. Do you understand that?
> [SCP-273 raises her head and glares at the camera.]
> **Dr. ████:** If you have any information that could aid in your case, it would be wise to -
> **SCP-273:** [inaudible]
> **Dr. ████:** [pause] You'll have to speak up.
> **SCP-273:** [voice is strained] I did not want to kill them. I told them to stay away. They chased after me because they cared, and I [DATA EXPUNGED]
> [2m 17s of tape omitted from this transcript]
> **Dr. ████:** We'll keep you safe here, 273.
> **SCP-273:** [noticeably calmer now, standing upright] Thank you. [sits in the provided chair] And by the way, my name is ███████████. You may use that instead.
> **Dr. ████:** Certainly. [pauses, shuffling of papers is heard.] What was the first thing you remember, from when you were younger?
> **SCP-273:** [long pause, followed by sharp inhalation] I woke up surrounded by flames and covered in ash. It was the first time, I think.
> **Dr. ████:** You remember nothing else from before that? How long ago was this? How old were you?
> **SCP-273:** Is it not proper to only ask o- [stops mid sentence, voice becomes mildly upset] I, I don't. It was a very long time ago. Probably [DATA EXPUNGED]
> **Dr. ████:** And how old were you?
> **SCP-273:** 3█ years, that much I remember. And [pause] I think I had made some great mistake. Perhaps that is why I am what I am now.
> **Dr. ████:** And what are you now?
> **SCP-273:** A demon.

**Incident Report 273-02:**
**Date:** ██/██/████
**Location:** Site ██

Agents █████ and ██████ entered the enclosure of SCP-273 with intent to question her regarding ████████████. She had earlier been granted a bottle of Bacardi 151 for personal use, due to good behavior. It had been 12 hours and 37 minutes since her last scheduled feeding. Upon the agents' entry, she demanded they leave. When they did not at first, she panicked, shouting at them and gesturing frantically. After they left, the bottle of Bacardi was observed to [DATA EXPUNGED]

[DATA EXPUNGED] extreme damage to SCP-273's enclosure and observation room due to flames of unprecedented strength. Recorded temperatures exceeded ████ degrees Celsius. Agent █████'s death will be handled as per normal procedure. Agent ██████ is still in recovery as of this writing. SCP-273's ashes have been contained in an air-tight, fire-proof safe. Her previous enclosure is to be repaired for future use in containing other SCPs.

**Incident Report 273-03:**
**Date:** ██/██/████
**Location:** Site ██

The fireproof safe was found to be ineffective in containing SCP-273. Severe corrosion damage to the interior and hinges of the safe led to breach of containment, followed by the resumed revival of SCP-273. Her required amount of raw meat was left in the room, and the door secured. Upon awakening, she appeared shaken, and after consuming the offered meal she requested to return to her original containment. As it has since been repaired, her request will be carried out immediately.

**Email Record:**
**Subject:** SCP-273's emotional state
**From:** Dr. ████
**To:** [DATA EXPUNGED]
**Date:** ██/██/████

SCP-273's emotional state continues to deteriorate since her recent death 30 days ago. She rarely leaves the private partition of her enclosure except to feed, and refuses to speak. Surveillance using ███████ shows she barely moves when on her own, either sleeping or sitting against one wall. She shows classic signs of depression, despite having no prior indications of it. The lack of human contact since the incident is likely to blame.

I am hopeful that her mood will improve if given some positive contact. She has demonstrated exceptional recall of events she has experienced, and her memory spans uncounted centuries. She has lived as a nomad for long periods of time, and while she had limited contact with people, she remained interested enough to remember how they lived. She may be of use to archaeology, and may shed light on some of our older contained artifacts.

I propose she be used as a resource for research in this and other pursuits. Awaiting your approval.
