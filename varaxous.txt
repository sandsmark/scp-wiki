* Do you have questions about SCP-4000? Well, look no further than [https://www.reddit.com/r/SCPDeclassified/comments/920z3u/scp4000_taboo_contest_entry/ r/SCPDeclassified on SCP-4000] and [[*user Doctor Cimmerian]]'s [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65ZOteo-Pvo Object Class Explained: SCP-4000.]
* Speaking of [[*user Doctor Cimmerian]], he also narrated the article. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyFuSYbLtLc Check it out!]
* [[*user pastarasta1]] made an SCP-4000-inspired animation. [http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/pastarasta1-s-simply-epic-artpage/taboo2 Here it is!]
