**Item #:** SCP-4388

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4388 is to be kept in a cryogenic vault at Site-11. The containment unit must be shielded from the full spectrum of electromagnetic signals. The vault must be outfitted with shock-dampeners to alleviate seismic tremors (refer to Addendum-002 for details). Monitoring equipment inside the containment chamber is not permitted; signal emissions must be avoided near SCP-4388. 

**Description:** SCP-4388 is a set of two, white, rectangular, multi-socket power strips, individually referred to as SCP-4388-1 and SCP-4388-2. The two objects are identical in design, both containing six inline sockets and an integrated circuit breaker. The sockets are of Type-B, standard North American / Japanese design. They are numbered in ascending order, beginning at #1, starting from the circuit breaker. 

SCP-4388 manifests the ability to double the power output of any energy source its input connector is subjected to. The six (6) output sockets are capable of independently producing the same level of power, regardless of current load. As such, SCP-4388 is capable of producing, in total, twelve (12) times the power of any given input. SCP-4388 presents no apparent resistance. Acting as a perfect conductor, there is no power loss while energy is traversing SCP-4388. There is no apparent limit to SCP-4388's ampacity, it will match the amperage of any source connected to it, without loss or damage to itself.

Energy output will always be in the form of electric power. Experiments have shown that the object is capable of transforming the entirety of the electromagnetic spectrum. The input connector does not need to be plugged into an object for this effect to occur. For instance, ultraviolet light shone onto SCP-4388's connector will produce more electrical power than infrared. The electrical power generated in this fashion is proportional to the wave's photonic energy. Additional testing has demonstrated that SCP-4388 is sensitive even to kinetic energy, a physical impact generates equivalent joules in electricity. 

It is unknown if and how SCP-4388 reacts to anomalous energy sources as experimentation of this nature is strictly prohibited (refer to Addendum-002). 

If SCP-4388's sockets are unconnected, the power they generate is transferred to the surrounding atmosphere. In the absence of atmosphere, SCP-4388 itself will heat up and will begin emitting black-body radiation. Even under proper containment, it is not possible to fully mitigate interaction from the following natural sources of energy, all of which have been observed to generate additional power: 
* The Earth's Magnetic Field 
* Cosmic Rays reaching Earth's surface
* Universal Background Radiation
* Random Quantum Fluctuations
Minor power excesses resulting from these sources are not impactful to SCP-4388's normal operations within Site-11 and can be safely ignored.

SCP-4388 is nearly impervious to electrical damage and heat. The threshold to damage it with electricity appears to be [DATA EXPUNGED] (refer to Experiment- [1/6/1959]). Wear from prolonged use visible on SCP-4388's casing demonstrates that it is capable of sustaining damage from friction and blunt force. No loss of capabilities resulting from this wear has been noted by Site-11 since the object's retrieval. 

**Electrical power generation procedure:** SCP-4388's anomalous properties can be put to use by the Foundation by providing electricity to Site-11, allowing it to remain self-sustaining.

Within its containment vault, SCP-4388 is to be connected to two superconducting cables. Both cables must lead to high-capacity electrical couplings outside the vault. When in service, the output cable is to be connected to Site-11 electrical grid's capacitors. A computer-monitored  circuit breaker must be on standby to ground the grid if the system detects a spike in power exceeding Site-11's specifications. The input cable is to be connected to Site-11's power generators. 

An analog severing mechanism must be available to cut either cable in case of emergencies. It must be activated manually, as remote signals do not function near SCP-4388 while it is under heavy load.

**Emergency procedure:** Under no circumstances should SCP-4388 form a closed circuit. Should this happen, evacuation of Site-11 is initiated immediately. An automated system will then attempt to trigger the severing mechanism. Technical personnel in charge of the containment unit are instructed to remain on-site to ensure SCP-4388's decoupling should the automated system malfunction. 

Failure to detach SCP-4388 within one (1) minute will lead to ignition of aerosolized Chlorine-Trifluoride on the level housing SCP-4388, disabling any circuitry contained therein.

> **Subject:** C-Class Technician 11325 (CT-11325)
> **Researcher:** Dr. Wu
> **Procedure:**
> * Disassembly of SCP-4388-2 with the goal of understanding its inner workings.
> * SCP-4388-2 and CT-11325 are located in an advanced monitoring bunker located below Research Site-███. 
> * CT-11325 proceeds with disassembly using standard electrician tool-kit. 
> * After disassembly and inspection of SCP-4388-2's components, CT-11325 proceeds with reassembly.
> **Results:** 
> * Inner components of SCP-4388-2 do not show any anomalous properties. Attempts at recreating previous test results were unsuccessful while SCP-4388-2's circuitry is exposed.
> * Additional testing shows the circuit material to have physical properties in line with mundane copper. 
> * Plastic casing material also falls within normal parameters.
> * Grounding circuits have been bypassed by modifications to the circuitry, in violation of NFPA 1 Standard 11.1.4.
> * Circuit breaker mechanism is soldered shut.
> * Piece of masking tape found inside plastic casing.
> * "Câlisse!", written in blue crayon, as well as an arrow pointing to the circuit breaker appear on the piece of tape. 
> After reassembly, the anomalous properties previously demonstrated by SCP-4388-2 appear to have dissipated. SCP-4388-2 now functions like a mundane power strip. A succession of assembly / reassembly by CT-11325 have not recovered its properties.
>SCP-4388-2 is henceforth classified as Neutralized.
>

> **Analysis:** Despite the mundane nature of SCP-4388-2's components, the modifications made to SCP-4388 prior to its retrieval by the Foundation reveal an interesting possibility.
>
>
> Our team's hypothesis is that SCP-4388 was purposefully altered by an individual. It is unclear if the modifications were an attempt to "fix" SCP-4388's anomalous properties or if they caused them to manifest in the first place. It is also possible that the alterations are not related to its anomalous properties. 
>
> Likewise, it is unclear why disassembly by Mr. ██████ has neutralized SCP-4388-2. Perhaps the properties of SCP-4388 originate from the individual who modified them.
>

> **Addendum-001**: Further investigations have revealed that the fingerprints recovered on the tape belong to a certain Mr. ████████.
> Information recovered regarding this individual revealed he is currently employed as an electrician in Rivière-aux-Outardes, Canada. He has since been recovered by the Foundation and will be interrogated shortly.

**Addendum 002:**
[[collapsible show="+ LEVEL 4 CLEARANCE REQUIRED" hide="- Clearance Granted"]]
On 28/10/1961, SCP-4388-1 was transferred to the Sukhoy Nos research site in order to support its operations with SCP-████. Usage of SCP-4388-1 was deemed critical as no major power generation solutions could be deployed urgently on Sukhoy Nos. Due to the nature of SCP-████, seismic tremors occurred with regularity on the island.

Shortly after its arrival, an earthquake rated 6.2 on the Richter Scale hit the area. The seismic shock triggered an unprecedented energy release by SCP-4388-1. The event's radius was determined to be 8,7 km, centered on the object. SCP-4388-1 was recovered, intact. As the kinetic energy absorbed by SCP-4388-1 was minimal, it is unclear why such a disproportionate release occurred.

Amnestics were administered to all surviving witnesses, mostly local indigenous populations outside of the blast zone. A coordinated media release was orchestrated, stating that the detonation was caused by an experimental soviet nuclear weapon. Radioactive material released on the peninsula served to give credence to the story.

Transfer of SCP-4388 will no longer be allowed outside of Site-11. Seismic shock-dampeners must be added to its containment vault. No further kinetic testing will be permitted.
