------

**Name:** Westrin

**Security Clearance:** Fluctuating.

**Duties:** Standing here within the sea of static.

**Site of Operations:** Site-551

**Rating Module:**

[[module rate]]

**Profile:** Dr. Westrin is a concept. Reports state that Dr. Westrin is a living being that has helped with several SCPs and SCP reports. Others report that Dr. Westrin never existed, and his name just appeared within the database abruptly. Whatever is the case, the O5 Council has determined that Dr. Westrin serves a purpose, and his continued existence is required for the continued existence of the Foundation and its doctors.

He thinks he's good at writing SCP reports, this is yet to be determined.

<h3>Author Commentary;</h3>
<br> ------
<br> <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3761" target="_top">SCP-3761:</a> Ah, squirrel war. This thing is a doozy. It's my first SCP, my first Keter, and until 4991, my most popular SCP. I started this, what, like 2 years ago? For some reason, I never moved on from this idea, and I was determined to make it work. Seven million more iterations later, and I forced myself to post it to overcome my performance anxiety, and I was extremely pleased when it reached +50. At the time of writing it's at +90, and it's rising steadily. I give this one a 9/10.
<br> ----------
<br> <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1831" target="_top">SCP-1831:</a> The original SCP-1831 that I made before the current one was a guy in an Eiffel Tower that couldn't leave the Eiffel Tower. It always was at a bad score, and it reached as low as -6, so I deleted it and replaced it with another skip: this time it's a sad one. I didn't really spend that much time on it, but a lot of people really liked it, so I posted it, and now it's at +50 at the time of writing. I give it a 9/10
<br> ----------
<br> <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4050" target="_top">SCP-4050:</a> I wrote this one a while ago that I kinda forgot. I recently dredged it up, fixed it up, and posted it. I dunno, I really like it, personally, and am proud of it, being my first "'short"" SCP (if you don't count 1831). I give it a 9/10.
<br> ----------
<br> <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/fifthbobpentapants" target="_top">Patrick Becomes Enlightened:</a> My first tale, and it's about fifthism and starfishes. What more could you ask for? Originally, in a past draft, all of Patrick's lines were just "fifth." People really didn't like that so I structured it like a regular spongebob episode until the very end, where it went off the deep end. FUN FACT: This originally wasn't going to be apart of project crossover, but halfway through writing it, I realized it fit the criteria, so I decided "hey why not." As of writing it's at around +90, and I'm pretty happy with its success. I give it a 9/10
<br> ----------
<br> <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4991" target="_top">SCP-4991:</a> Ah, the 4chan one. This is my first collaboration, and was a collab between me and plaguebearer. Around 8 months ago, I wrote the rough draft of this, that featured only reddit, twitter, and facebook. The reddit section used bootlegged code from oneiroi articles, the twitter one was a less bootlegged version of oneiroi code, and the facebook one was shitty screenshots from a "facebook comment generator" that I found on page two of google. plague used inspect element to make it actually look nice, we added a tumblr section, replaced facebook with 4chan, and twitter basically stayed the same. I give it a 9/10.
<br> ----------
<br> <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4135" target="_top">SCP-4135:</a> This shouldn't work. I wrote it in like 2 days. It should be dead. In the gutter. quack quack. 9/10.
<br> ----------
<br> <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3748" target="_top">SCP-3748:</a> Around a year ago, seagull pmed me and asked if I wanted to collab on an SCP about a nice guy bowl of flies, to which I said "hell yes." After a year of constantly forgetting the draft existed, it's finally here. I'm particularly proud of my bits of the draft, which are mostly both the interviews. I give it a 9/10.
<br> ----------
<br> <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4335" target="_top">SCP-4335:</a> This is my most ambitious SCP yet. The idea came around when I was watching some subpar Minecraft SCP roleplays, and I thought to myself "Huh, what if there actually was an anomaly in Minecraft?" I was also inspired by SCP-3085, so thanks to that. It's also my... fourth Keter. I'm just stockpiling these things, aren't I? I give this a 9/10.
