> **Unknown 1:** Would you consider yourself a religious person?
> 
> **Unknown 2:** I mean... not really, no.
> 
> **Unknown 1:** Good. You're about to be soon, I imagine.
> 
> **Unknown 2:** What's this all about Jacob?
> 
> **Unknown 1:** You know the database: SCPs assigned to different numbers. It starts at SCP-002. That's odd, don't ya think?
> 
> **Unknown 2:** I mean, yeah?
> 
> **Unknown 1:** What about SCP-001? The first one? What could it be?
> 
> **Unknown 2:** Uh... maybe the first SCP they ever discovered?
> 
> **Unknown 1:** Perhaps, but the database picks random numbers from a huge selection for their anomalies. It would be weird if 001 was the only number they deliberately chose. Except it's not weird at all. There's something big in that slot. 
> 
> **Unknown 2:** Is... is this even allowed?
> 
> **Unknown 1:** Not at all. I've determined that there IS an SCP-001: it's just locked for us. 
> 
> **Unknown 2:** Does it say what clearance it requires?
> 
> **Unknown 1:** Nope. All I could find are references that it exists.
> 
> **Unknown 2:** Weird. I still have a bad feeling about this. The Foundation is... pretty lenient with killing people that have classified information.
> 
> **Unknown 1:** Our ancestors all have risked their lives for the pursuit of knowledge, to the tasting of an unfamiliar berry on a weird colored tree, to the the consumption of the forbidden fruit, despite God's instructions. This is no different.
> 
> **Unknown 2:** No, that IS different...
> 
> **Unknown 1:** You want to know, don't you?
> 
> **Unknown 2:** I mean...
> 
> **Unknown 1:** SCP-001 could be God. SCP-001 could be the Guardian to Eden. SCP-001 could be //us.// Don't you want to know? I sure as hell do.
> 
> **Unknown 2:** ...yes. Yes I would.
> 
> **Unknown 1:** I'll get started on trying to retrieve the file. Wish me luck. 
> 
> **Unknown 2:** Good luck... I guess.
