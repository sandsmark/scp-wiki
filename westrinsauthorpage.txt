title:Westrin's Personnel File
**Name:** Westrin

**Security Clearance:** Fluctuating.

**Duties:** Standing here within the sea of static.

**Site of Operations:** Site-551

**Rating Module:**

[[module rate]]

**Profile:** Dr. Westrin is a concept. Reports state that Dr. Westrin is a living being that has helped with several SCPs and SCP reports. Others report that Dr. Westrin never existed, and his name just appeared within the database abruptly. Whatever is the case, the O5 Council has determined that Dr. Westrin serves a purpose, and his continued existence is required for the continued existence of the Foundation and its doctors.

He thinks he's good at writing SCP reports, this is yet to be determined.

<h3>Author Commentary;</h3>
<br> ------
<br> <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3761" target="_top">SCP-3761:</a> Ah, squirrel war. This thing is a doozy. It's my first SCP, my first Keter, and until 4991, my most popular SCP. I started this, what, like 2 years ago? For some reason, I never moved on from this idea, and I was determined to make it work. Seven million more iterations later, and I forced myself to post it to overcome my performance anxiety, and I was extremely pleased when it reached +50. At the time of writing it's at +90, and it's rising steadily. I give this one a 9/10.
<br> ----------
<br> <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1831" target="_top">SCP-1831:</a> The original SCP-1831 that I made before the current one was a guy in an Eiffel Tower that couldn't leave the Eiffel Tower. It always was at a bad score, and it reached as low as -6, so I deleted it and replaced it with another skip: this time it's a sad one. I didn't really spend that much time on it, but a lot of people really liked it, so I posted it, and now it's at +50 at the time of writing. I give it a 9/10
<br> ----------
<br> <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4050" target="_top">SCP-4050:</a> I wrote this one a while ago that I kinda forgot. I recently dredged it up, fixed it up, and posted it. I dunno, I really like it, personally, and am proud of it, being my first "'short"" SCP (if you don't count 1831). I give it a 9/10.
<br> ----------
<br> <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/fifthbobpentapants" target="_top">Patrick Becomes Enlightened:</a> My first tale, and it's about fifthism and starfishes. What more could you ask for? Originally, in a past draft, all of Patrick's lines were just "fifth." People really didn't like that so I structured it like a regular spongebob episode until the very end, where it went off the deep end. FUN FACT: This originally wasn't going to be apart of project crossover, but halfway through writing it, I realized it fit the criteria, so I decided "hey why not." As of writing it's at around +90, and I'm pretty happy with its success. I give it a 9/10
<br> ----------
<br> <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4991" target="_top">SCP-4991:</a> Ah, the 4chan one. This is my first collaboration, and was a collab between me and plaguebearer. Around 8 months ago, I wrote the rough draft of this, that featured only reddit, twitter, and facebook. The reddit section used bootlegged code from oneiroi articles, the twitter one was a less bootlegged version of oneiroi code, and the facebook one was shitty screenshots from a "facebook comment generator" that I found on page two of google. plague used inspect element to make it actually look nice, we added a tumblr section, replaced facebook with 4chan, and twitter basically stayed the same. I give it a 9/10.
<br> ----------
<br> <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4135" target="_top">SCP-4135:</a> This shouldn't work. I wrote it in like 2 days. It should be dead. In the gutter. quack quack. 9/10.
<br> ----------
<br> <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3748" target="_top">SCP-3748:</a> Around a year ago, seagull pmed me and asked if I wanted to collab on an SCP about a nice guy bowl of flies, to which I said "hell yes." After a year of constantly forgetting the draft existed, it's finally here. I'm particularly proud of my bits of the draft, which are mostly both the interviews. I give it a 9/10.
<br> ----------
<br> <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4335" target="_top">SCP-4335:</a> This is my most ambitious SCP yet. The idea came around when I was watching some subpar Minecraft SCP roleplays, and I thought to myself "Huh, what if there actually was an anomaly in Minecraft?" I was also inspired by SCP-3085, so thanks to that. It's also my... fourth Keter. I'm just stockpiling these things, aren't I? I give this a 9/10.
<br> ----------
<br> <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4521" target="_top">SCP-4521:</a> I have no idea where the idea for this skip came from, but I vividly remember it creeping me out a bit when I thought of it, which almost never happens when it comes to my ideas. It used to be the shortest time I took from conception to posting, but 4559 has since demolished that record, :P. 9/10.
<br> ----------
<br> <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3657" target="_top">SCP-3657:</a> Originally, this was posted on day 2 of Jamcon, but it was sorta... eh in how it was presented and had a mediocre score and all that. Nico rewrote it so that it actually makes some sort of sense. It still is my love letter to Pulp Fiction. Go watch it y'all, great movie. I give the movie a 10/10, but this SCP gets a 9/10.
<br> ----------
<br> <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4559" target="_top">SCP-4559:</a> I had a random idea, and pooped this out. I wrote it in like 15 minutes and posted it only like 45 minutes later. It's been said by multiple people that it screams Douglas Adams, and I take that as a big compliment. Also, first thaumiel, first coldpost, and it's a short one too, so it was fun to write. Pretty great, 9/10.
<br> ----------
<br> <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4098" target="_top">SCP-4098:</a> I saw Henzoid link a random draft in discord, and I suggested a bunch of stuff. He asked if I wanted to be listed as a coauthor and I accepted. After that point, the draft went through the entirety of www.yourthesaurus.com as well as www.thesaurus.com, and four different iterations, but we're pretty happy where it's at right now. 9/10.
<br> ----------
<br> <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4885" target="_top">SCP-4885:</a> I have a friend who really loves "In soviet russia, [blank] [blank]s you" type memes, and she linked a meme that stated "In soviet russia, waldo finds you" and that gave me an idea for a scary Waldo monster. I really liked the idea of an effect so simple as "If you know where it's located, you die" which requires really fuckin long containment procedures, and it was really fun to write. I give waldo a 6/10 for entirely unrelated reasons, but this SCP is a 9/10.
