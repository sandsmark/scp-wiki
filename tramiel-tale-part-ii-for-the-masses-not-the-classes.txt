Growing up, Sam Tramiel could only remember seeing his father over lunch. Always busying himself with Commodore's business meant the senior Tramiel could only make time for ham sandwiches and fizzing cola. Talking was, of course, out of the question. Abhorring the very idea of seeing his son's food combined with an efficiency-first mindset equaled sitting in silence, with only the occasional request to pass the mayo serving as father-son bonding time.

That tactile feeling of stale bread and ham was lingering in Sam's mind as the elevator to Atari Corporation's executive offices dinged open. Sam's footsteps wouldn't stop echoing in the marble halls, no matter how light his steps or pace. It didn't matter. A thick pair of arms were suddenly 
embracing him.

"Sam! What the hell are you doing skulking around here like that? Goddamn! I've got us some sandwiches in my office."

Nodding silently, Sam allowed himself to be led further into the gaming empire's executive maze. Navigating effortlessly, Jack was soon producing the key to open the oak office door. Inside, as promised, two ham sandwiches were sitting in their deli wrapping atop a wooden picnic table. 

The rest of Jack's office was the picture of executive imperium, every wall's splendor outdoing the others. Photograph's of Jack shaking hands with various Presidents, Roman columns in each corner, and a bejeweled sword hanging in a polished glass case behind that mahogany desk. In betwixt this magnificence, Sam Tramiel was sitting with his father at a quaint picnic table, as if Yogi Bear would come at any moment asking for a pic-a-nic basket.

The two Tramiel's eyes were in unbreaking contact throughout the meal. Jack was soon licking his lips, leaning back and looking at his son like a prize fish. "Son, son, I can't tell you how happy it makes me to have you come to the family business. It's not the family business I wanted to pass on, but the one you deserve."

Sam made movements somewhere between nodding, gulping, and smiling.

"You're not going to eat that pickle, right?" Before Sam had a chance at answering, his father was picking it up and chewing it down in one fell swoop. "Anyways, as I was saying, Atari isn't your everyday company. We've got... some trade secrets."

Nodding, Sam thought back to a nugget of father's wisdom. //If you don't cheat, you don't win.//

"It's not what you're thinking of. You haven't been to a church lately, right?"

"Ughmm-" Sam's eyes began narrowing, searching for meaning. "Well, not since Gram-"

"Good! That's the only thing I needed to know, recency." Leaning forward, Jack took his son's hand. "Now Sam, listen here. You're going to catch a lot of flak leading this company. They'll find a derogatory nickname for you ten times worse than 'Jackintosh' or 'Attila' or 'that bastard' and you know why? They're going to try and make you into me. But you can be your own man. That's what Atari needs."

"I'm ready for it, Father."

"No, you're ready for them. You're not ready for... our trade secret. At least not yet."

Sam stood, crossing his arms. "Look, either tell me what you're talking about or stop beating around the bush. It's not like you."

Jack burst out laughing. "That's my boy! Alright, as you wish. No more time to waste!" Leaping to his feet, the old man positively danced over to his desk and, reaching into a drawer, flipped an unseen switch. Retracing behind the wall the glass case's polished glass gave way to shining steel. Swinging swiftly and plunging into the ground, the sword then rose to reveal an elevator that had been hiding beneath their feet.

It took a few moments before Sam began exhaling again. "Father, I have questions."

Jack was already stepping inside, "This is the fancy one, you’ll get to using it when needed. The gremlins clock in downstairs. Come along, we'll get your answers." 

Crossing the elevator's threshold, it was like flipping a switch. A hot wind whipping and howling all around them as a feeling of free-fall surrounding and pounding the walls disappearing that lost engineering with nothing else steering their way.

Sam, falling alone, felt his father's hand clamping over his mouth to stop the screaming. Jack's fingers curling back and burning. Sam merely expending kindling, until even ashes were going bankrupt.
Blinking, Sam's realizing he yet lived was pleasantly surprising. Gingerly picking himself up, Sam's waiting for his eyes to grow used to the darkness was in vain.

//It is dark, you are likely to be eaten by a grue.//

Jack's firm hand gripping his shoulder almost gave Sam heart palpitations. A voice both distinctly and unrecognizably belonging to his father began gurgling behind him. "My boy, this is where the breaking of Commodore began. I've used them sparingly, to their chagrin, but used them all the same."

"Father... why?"

"A sweetheart deal with darkness. These men, not men, these creatures, they sold their souls for power. So focused on their great and terrible power they lost sight of worldly affairs. I have made Tramiel's master of the dark without tainting our souls."

"I don't want this. Let me out. Please. Father, this isn't what I thought you wanted to pass on to me. It's not right!"

"Right? What's right is your birthright, your father's creation passing on to you. Samuel, you are my eldest blood. Finish the fight. The corruption of your birthright must be destroyed for their crimes against our family."

"This is against everything I thought you were teaching me."

Flashing before Sam's eyes were images of circuit boards dripping with blood. Joysticks twisting and unnaturally bending. A computer monitor activating to the sound of static forever. The floppy discs were crying. Even they didn't know why.

Sam's throat wouldn't stop screaming for water. Croaking, his eyes wishing for tears, Sam's turning revealed Sam’s lone form was standing in the office. All evidence of their lunch gone. Shaking, his eyes wildly searching the room, falling on the eye-catching desk placard:
