**Item #:** SCP-2921

**Object Class:** --Euclid-- Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2921 represents a Class V Causal Inconsistency Zone and therefore no physical containment measures are to be taken. It is presumed that any and all actions taken that may affect SCP-2921 will affect SCP-2921 in some way, thus attentive, non-interactive study of the anomaly is the only safe way to gain further knowledge of its properties.

Experimentation and interaction with SCP-2921 is currently prohibited following a joint summit of the O5 Council and the Ethics Committee. However, in the event an individual violates the terms of this ruling, personnel are discouraged from stopping anyone who has already made a conscious decision to do so. Once interaction is complete, subjects are to be terminated. Ideal termination methods used must possess as close to a 0% chance of failure as possible.[[footnote]] Thaumaturgic tools are currently being developed with increased probabilistic capabilities and general lethality for use in future termination efforts.[[/footnote]]

**Description:** SCP-2921 refers to a single American Beech (//Fagus grandfolia//) located in Shenandoah Valley, Virginia. SCP-2921 has grown through a heretofore undiscovered dirt pathway that runs near Hughes River, separating the trail into two divergent paths that converge back into one around the base of the tree. SCP-2921's roots are tightly wound into the root systems of nearby trees and plants, making removal and relocation extremely difficult, if not impossible.

The area containing SCP-2921 is causally inconsistent on a level that is not well understood with the Foundation's current levels of technology. The following axioms are considered known about SCP-2921:

* The system by which processes connect to states (Defined as "causality") is inherently divergent upon choosing a direction in which to pass by SCP-2921 while walking on the trail.
* This system is only divergent when passing SCP-2921 from the trailhead; attempts to pass SCP-2921 from larger distances or other directions have not yielded anomalous effects.
* Processes affected by this divergence phenomenon also become inherently divergent and therefore causally inconsistent themselves.
* Divergent processes continue to exhibit anomalous behavior every time a choice is made by the subject(s), regardless of whether or not it was made consciously.
* Involuntary actions are not included in this criteria.
* Actions taken that influence the status of SCP-2921 have unexpected divergent consequences, therefore neutralization of the anomaly is deemed unsafe to attempt.

SCP-2921 was brought to the attention of the Foundation on 07/12/2018 when the National Parks Department reported an unprecedented surge in Shenandoah Valley's local populations of the Spined Micrathena spider (//Micrathena gracilis//) which appeared, upon closer inspection, to be genetically identical to one another. Foundation investigations took place along the surrounding areas until SCP-2921's trail was identified on 07/17/2018 as the only notable landmark within several kilometers of the area with the highest concentrations of the spider. Further efforts to pinpoint the exact location of the anomaly were successful during D-Class walkthrough hazard testing of the trail, which was approved following its discovery.

**Addendum 2921.1:** Testing Log

> **Test Log:** 2921-01
> 
> **Date:** 07/18/2018
> 
> **Subject:** D-19023
> 
> **Preface:** D-19023 was instructed to hike along trail containing SCP-2921. 
> 
> ------
> 
> [BEGIN LOG]
> 
> //00:00// - D-19023 is seen traveling along path. Subject appears disinterested.
> 
> //03:15// - Subject approaches fork in trail where SCP-2921 is located.
> 
> //03:23// - D-19023 takes a left around SCP-2921. As he does so, a translucent image of D-19023 is seen taking the right side. Image solidifies as subject rounds SCP-2921.
> 
> //03:25// - Subject appears startled. Image becomes heavily distressed. 
> 
> //03:35// - Image of D-19023 attempts to flee testing area. A second image of D-19023 is seen diverging from first and does not attempt escape.
> 
> //04:32// - First copy of D-19023 is shot several times by armed Foundation personnel for attempting to leave. A third and fourth copy separate simultaneously as the first slumps over, apparently dead. New instances are wounded in the same places but still alive. One staggers back in the direction of SCP-2921 while the other continues to attempt escape. Second copy remains frozen in place.
> 
> //05:52// - The original instance of D-19023 appears to raise hands in shock. A second pair of arms are seen at subject's sides. Subject does not notice this right away. 
> 
> //06:16// - Additional Foundation forces appear onsite, including a unit equipped with aeresolized nerve agents.
> 
> //06:20// - Subject notices extra limbs and falls back in surprise. Upon doing so, D-19023 separates completely from them, diverging again into two distinct copies. Armed forces command instances of D-19023 to cease action to prevent further divergence.
> 
> //07:23// - Subjects are terminated using nerve agents. Divergence continues until all instances are completely neutralized. Remains exhibit no anomalous behavior and are incinerated without incident.

> **Notes:** Testing with SCP-2921 has been suspended indefinitely. It is projected that, if left unchecked, SCP-2921 has potential to create a causally chaotic snowball effect that would theoretically culminate in an irreversible NK-Class "Grey Goo" Scenario within approximately twenty iterations of divergence.

**Incident Log 2921.1:**

Guards initially stationed at the trailhead and embedded in the local parks department reported an unexplained increase in factual inconsistencies between documentation and personal accounts of various staff members starting around the same time as initial containment and suppression efforts of SCP-2921 were established. The effect appeared to increase in strength and complexity for all involved, leading to a perceived "canonical" split that was only detected when multiple conflicting reports about the situation were submitted. All involved were terminated and containment efforts of SCP-2921 were discontinued. Upgrade to Keter classification approved.
