**Item #:** SCP-801

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** See [[[SCP-800]]].

**Description:** SCP-801 is a collection of seven articles of fur clothing found inside SCP-800 upon original discovery. All are made from real animal pelts, though none include any identification as to who constructed them. 

Original contents of SCP-800’s larger confines are as follows:

-One (1) mink fur coat (SCP-801-1)
-One (1) raccoon fur coat (SCP-801-2)
-One (1) wolf fur coat (SCP-801-3)
-One (1) squirrel fur coat (SCP-801-4)
-One (1) bear fur coat (SCP-801-5)

Each coat is of a full-body design with a hood, and the pockets are empty.

Contents of the drawer are as follows:

-One (1) pair of rabbit-skin mittens (SCP-801-6)
-One (1) pair of elk-skin shoes (SCP-801-7)

When any of these coats are worn for longer than five (5) minutes, the wearer undergoes a slow transformation into whatever animal the coat is made from. The process is painless (save for mild itchiness and a “tingling” sensation throughout the body) and continues until the person is 100% animal. The entire process takes approximately forty (40) seconds. 

If the coat is taken off during any point during the initial “animalization”, the process will immediately stop, leaving the person in a half-human, half-animal state until the coat is put back on. Once the coat is put back on however, the metamorphosis speeds up in an attempt to make up for lost time. During the first five minutes, the coat can be taken on and off at one’s leisure without worry as long as they do not keep it on for any longer than five minutes. Simply touching any of the garments holds no affect.

SCP-801-6 and -7 also hold this animalization power, but are limited only to the hands and feet: wearing SCP-801-6 results in rabbit paws; SCP-801-7 result in elk hooves.

Analysis of the animalization process breaks it down into the following stages, measured in seconds worn after the five-minute grace period:

**05 sec.:** Body hair begins to grow in thickness and length. Longer hair shrinks until it reaches a length uniform to body hair. Faint itching in more sensitive areas is reported. Nails and teeth begin to thicken. Speech is normal, but with involuntary growling and chattering.

**10 sec:** Nails become longer and thicker. Feet and hands lengthen. Body hair is thick and begins to change color. Muzzle shows signs of growth. Teeth and tongue lengthens. Body fat starts to vanish and muscles visibly shift in size and shape. Long bones and spine begin to arch. Speech is difficult, but intelligible. Growling and animal noises become more frequent.

**15 sec:** Subject’s skin is now completely covered with hair. Muzzle is prominent and eyes change color and shape. Ears, nose and teeth greatly resemble target animal’s. Tips of the digits, soles and palms thicken and darken and claws are almost fully developed. Fingers are thicker but still functional. Speech is near-unintelligible and consists almost entirely of animal noises.

(Note: During the entire animalization process, the coat is removable. However, beyond the 15-second stage the subject will possessively cling to the coat and forcibly refuse any outside aid in taking off the garment)

**30 sec:** Subject’s head and face now completely resembles target animal’s. Hair is thick enough to be classified as fur. Hands now only function as front paws and thumbs are useless. Subject will normally get down on all fours at this point. Tail will be visible (depending on coat worn at the time). Speech is impossible.

**35 sec:** Subject’s size begins to shrink/grow to the size of the target animal. Arms become front legs. Subject no longer responds to their original name.

**40 sec:** Subject now resembles animal completely. Animal has no memories before transformation and will act upon instinct as a wild animal would. The only remainders of subject’s previous humanity are their finger and toe-prints, which are present on the subject’s pawpads. At this point, subject will crawl out of the coat (as well as any clothes they were wearing underneath) and purposely avoid them at all costs. The reason for this behavior is unknown.

Those who have undergone animalization via SCP-801-6 and -7 still retain their human memories, though studies have shown that those who have undergone the metamorphosis suffer from paranoia, hypersexuality, and a refusal to eat anything but raw fruits and vegetables (regardless weather or not the subject was vegan prior to testing).

**Addendum 01:** For a detailed report on a “cure” for this transformation, refer to Addendum under [[[SCP-800]]].

**Addendum 02:** Testing the coats on non-human species has yielded unusual results. Though putting an ordinary animal inside a coat made from its own species (I.E., placing a raccoon inside SCP-801-2) has no effect, placing ordinary animals inside a coat made from a different animal results in [DATA EXPUNGED] 

//Memo: “All requests to test the affects of SCP-801 on [[[SCP-682]]] have been denied, and any further requests will be ignored. You all remember what happened when we put SCP-801-3 on that chimp- Christ, what the hell were you all thinking that time? Besides, we’re trying to kill that damn thing, not play dress-up with it."//
