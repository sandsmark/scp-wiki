As of January 3, 19██, SCP-4421 is no longer in containment due to the continuing agreement between the Foundation and the leadership of [http://www.scp-wiki.net/larue-hub LoI-504 ("La Rue Macabre")].  In the event that SCP-4421 should be recontained, MTF Beta-2 ("Bayou Boys") should be activated for retrieval, due to their familiarity with LoI-504 and its occupants. 

Foundation assets in the New Orleans and greater Louisiana area should be alerted to the ongoing "relationship" with LoI-504, and to be on the lookout for any violations of the agreement. Should such a violation occur, the asset should report directly to Site-93 command for debriefing. Anomalous traffic in and out of the New Orleans area, principally the French Quarter should be monitored for the presence of restricted persons of interest or individuals associated with Level-3 GoI.

A GPS tracking device was initially attached to SCP-4421, but it ceased to function shortly after it was returned to PoI-504A ("Papa Legba"). Its last known location was Jackson Square in the French Quarter district of New Orleans, LA. It is assumed that SCP-4421 is still localized to that area, or to the Way-locked Nexus of LoI-504.

[[collapsible show="+ Archived SCP-4421 Containment Procedures" hide="- Close"]]
> SCP-4421 should be contained in a standard lead-lined containment locker at Reliquary Site-76.  Due to the nature of SCP-4421, under no circumstances is any Hoodoo practitioner or Voodoo adherent to be allowed within a 100m exclusion zone around the containment area. 
> 
> In the event of intrusion of a practitioner into the exclusion zone, on-site security should treat them as instances of SCP-4421-1, and utilize any and all force necessary to prevent access to SCP-4421. 
>  
> Any researchers wishing to study SCP-4421 or utilize SCP-4421 in the study of other objects must fail the Faith, Ecclesiastic, and Religious index with a maximum FEaR rating of 3.

++++++ __**Description**__
[[/div]]
SCP-4421 is a highly ornate walking cane topped with an intricately carved depiction of one of several different animals[[footnote]]Most often depicting a member of the //Canis familiaris// Canidae subfamily.[[/footnote]]. The carvings along the shaft of the cane have also been observed to shift and change, but most often depict various pictographic renditions of the transatlantic slave trade.

The cane itself appears to have been hand carved from a dark colored wood, largely resembling //wenge//[[footnote]]A product of the //Millettia laurentii// species of West African megaflora.[[/footnote]]. This is an educated hypothesis, as testing on the wood itself has largely been inconclusive due to the high levels of Akiva radiation produced by the artifact.

Due to the Akiva radiation and the nature of the previous owner of SCP-4421, it has been classified as a Class 3 Religious Artifact.

++++++ **Discovery**
[[/div]]
SCP-4421 was initially recovered on March 3, 1982. Embedded Foundation assets alerted Louisiana regional Command that a Global Occult Coalition kill squad had been activated and sent to New Orleans to neutralize a Class 3 anomalous entity. Foundation assets were mobilized to assist in containing the anticipated fallout from the confrontation. 

MTF Beta-2 ("Bayou Boys") Alpha Squad was activated and sent to monitor the conflict directly.

**Incident Video Log Transcript**
**Date:** 1982/03/03 @ 21:02
**Monitoring Team:** MTF Beta-2 ("Bayou Boys")
**Operational directive:** Observe incident & direct containment efforts.
**Team Lead:** Lt. Major Francois Arnaud, "Alpha"
-----

[BEGIN LOG]

**Alpha:** Keep it tight, everyone. The crowds are just getting started, so stay close.

//<The video pans as Maj. Arnaud glances about his team. The crowd around them is loud and in the early stages of the Mardi Gras celebration>//

**Delta:** The Gockers are going after someone in this mess? They must really want this guy if they're willing to risk this many civvies. 

**Beta:** Or they just don't fucking care. 

**Alpha:** Can it. We're working with them now, remember? We may not agree with their methods, but the O5s have decided that we're to play nice. We're C&C on this one, so we shouldn't be facing anything nasty directly. 

**Delta:** //<Under her breath>// For once.

**Alpha:** I heard that, Chalmers. More importantly, it's being recorded. 

//<The team moves through the crowd for several minutes, Maj. Arnaud's viewpoint shifting as he attempts to locate the target. After a few minutes, the team steps out into Jackson Square.>//

**Beta:** Eyes on, Major. Denim overalls, straw hat, cane. Far side of the outer ring. He's talking with that grunge band. 

//<Maj. Arnaud's view settles briefly on an older-looking black man dressed as described chatting amicably with a group of street musicians set up off to the side of the outer ring.>//

**Alpha:** Copy. I see him. Look to the buildings, that's where the GOC teams usually-

//<A shot rings out, interrupting the Major. His viewpoint rapidly shifts as he ducks low, swinging jerkily towards the central spire and the group of musicians. The man in the straw hat is down, and all but two of the musicians are scattering.>//

**Alpha:** Shooter's in St. Louis' church. Target is down, I repeat, target is do-

**Beta:** Uh, not quite, Major. 

//<Maj. Arnaud's view shifts back to the target in time to see him climbing to his feet. A large hole has been torn in the back of his overalls, and the viewpoint allows the watcher to clearly see one of the musicians through the body of the older man>//

**Delta:** Fuck me, how is that bas-

//<The old man stamps his cane down hard on the ground next to him, and the flagstones ripple at the point of impact. Black smoke pours from around the outstretched palm of the old man, and the pale figure of another man can be seen streaking through the smoke towards the St. Louis steeple.>// 

**Alpha:** Bender! The Bonfeld-Carizza's not detecting any Hume flux, it's gotta be Akiva. 

**Beta:** It's a Black? Fuck this, they didn't prep us for a goddamn Black. 

**Alpha:** Stay low, get the civvies out of here. Command! Code Gamma-Black. I repeat, Code Gamma-Black. 

//<The musician has finished helping the old man to his feet, as another several more shots ring out across the square. A GOC contact team can be seen advancing upon the two musicians and the old man. One of the musicians, a 7-foot tall man dressing like some grungy, singed cowboy, suddenly shimmers and bursts into flame. With a roar, it flings several gouts of flame towards the GOC operatives, catching two of them in coronas of liquid fire.>//

**Alpha:** Command, they're fighting back. Get a full-scale response team here quickly, if there're any Alpha Omega elements nearby that would be best. Jackson Square is mostly clear-

//<A large explosion interrupts him, and the Major's viewpoint shifts back towards the old man. Roiling black clouds of smoke has enveloped him and the attacking GOC team. Flashes of gunfire can be seen within the occluding smoke, and then nothing.>//

**Beta:** What the hell was that?

**Alpha:** Anyone have eyes on those Gockers? Delta, sweep left. Gamma, check the church. Beta, with me.

//<Maj. Arnaud stands and heads towards the dissipating smoke. Several GOC operatives can be seen sprawled across the stones, their black body armor mangled and smoking.>//

**Beta:** Don't often see the GOC boys on the losing end of things. 

**Alpha:** No kidding. Do you see the target?

//<The view sweeps left and right for a few moments showing only several damaged instruments and the bodies of the GOC operatives.>//

**Delta:** Nothing here, Major. 

**Gamma:** Major, the whole top of the goddamn church is... I'm not going up there, Major. 

**Alpha:** Heard. Command, the situation appears to be quieting. No sign of target, multiple GOC casualties. 

**Beta:** Hey, check this out. 

//<Maj. Arnaud's view shifts back towards Beta, where he can be seen squatting next to the old man's cane.>//

**Alpha:** Right. Command, send a retrieval team. Assume the artifact is still hot. 

**Afterword:** //The contact and retrieval teams arrived minutes later to stabilize the situation. Several Amnerosol dispersal units were dispatched, and the cover story Epsilon Omicron 6 ("Gas Explosion") was disseminated to the local press. SCP-4421 was retrieved by an Artifact Containment Team and transported to Site-76 for study.//

On March 21, 1982, a letter was received at Site-76 addressed to the head researcher assigned to SCP-4421.

Dr. Tonnelier,

I understand that you are currently in possession of something that doesn't belong to you. Now, I understand that it isn't up to you whether or not you keep my cane, but that is being handled elsewhere. 

Instead, as a show of good faith to your O5s, I'd tell you a bit about it. Of course, it's not entirely altruistic, but I'm sure you will understand. 

That stick is the manifestation of the desire for a Way. The uncounted dreams of the many seeking freedom, or a place to call home, or to simply //be//, without the worry that someone like you Jailors will come a'knockin'.  For over two hundred years I, (with the help of such fine folks as the two men your Agents met the other day) have kept the Way open to those folk that ain't got no where else to go. The oppressed, the repressed, the downtrodden. 

When the white devils took my people across the water, I and Nancy was with them. They called to us here, within the swamp, and we answered. Eventually, we met Cotton and the Fonteyns, and they lent a hand. We five helped them build a new place, a new home, we helped them to escape. We helped the Railroad, and we operate our station still for those who would be oppressed. 

My stick helps me do that, by opening the Way, by helping us navigate in and out La Rue Macabre when and where we need. 

You're from the Bayou, Franco. You have more'n a little swampwater in your veins, even though you've moved so far away. You grew up the tales of voodoo men and swampwater gods. Of the Old Ones that came over in cramped and stinking boats carrying your ancestors to a new shore. Once you joined the Foundation, you knew there was more to those myths than most believed. 

I and the others? We still keep those myths only myths. We give them a home, and they stay there. We keep them out of your hair, and we keep them safe. That stick helps me do that, and without it...

I'm sure even the Traitors wouldn't want the streets in New Orleans to be flooded by more anomalies.

Yours Sincerely, 
Papa Legba

**Interview Video Log Transcript**
**Date:** 1982/04/10 @ 11:02
**Interviewer:** O5-█
**Interviewed:** PoI-504A ("Papa Legba")
**Foreword:** //The details on where this interview took place and the circumstances leading up to the interview have been expunged. From the video recording, the interview was conducted in a nondescript room in an undisclosed location. PoI-504A is sitting at ease across the table from someone out of the camera's field of view.//
-----

[BEGIN LOG]

**O5-█:** The details of your proposal have merit, Mr. Legba. If we may, I would like to go over them again just so that we have an official record.

**PoI-504A:** Of course, [DATA EXPUNGED]. I'd be happy to. 

**O5-█:** We are discussing a tentative arrangement between the Foundation and the whole of La Rue Macabre.

**PoI-504A:** That is correct. The main gist of what I'm suggestin' is that La Rue become a kind of "neutral ground". I believe y'all call them 'Free Ports?' We keep the riff raff of our part of the anomalous world outta your hair, an' you folks stay outta our bidness. 

**O5-█:** We have a lot of secured sites, Mr. Legba. How would this be better option than our coming in and just securing the lot of you?

**PoI-504A:** //<chuckling>// I'm thinkin' that'd be a lot more difficult than you expect. Plus, it'd cost ya a fair amount of resources. Nah, what y'all really want is to protect' the normals from people like me. Me an' mine ain't all that into carin' about what they's into, nor do we care all that much about int'ractin' with 'em. We gots us a place, an' we're likely t'stay there. No dollas spent by you, no wasted resources keepin' us in a place we want to stay in anyway.

**O5-█:** So, in effect, you would be containing them on our behalf?

**PoI-504A:** Nah, not 'xactly. Moreso we'd keep a place for 'em, and we'd not spill out overmuch into N'awlins. The Quarter's already a weird place, [DATA EXPUNGED]. Most of us fit right in down there, unnoticed. We jus' be keepin' it that way. There's a damn sight more of us 'n you realize, already shacked up in La Rue. 

**O5-█:** I see. Very well, Mr. Legba. I will present your argument to the others and we shall see what happens.

**PoI-504A:** Fair 'nuff.

++++ Preamble
The undersigned, O5-1 representing the O5 Counsel of the SCP Foundation, on the one hand, and Papa Legba, representing the collective unincorporated residential district of La Rue Macabre, in the interest of creating a stable peace between our two entities, and to create a lasting zone of neutrality for persons of an anomalous nature, do individually, collectively, and mutually agree to accept and to be bound and governed by the conditions and terms of armistice set forth in the following articles and paragraphs, which said conditions and terms are intended to pertain solely to the region in and around New Orleans, LA and the La Rue Macabre Nexus: 

++++ Article I
**The Demarcation Line and Zone of Neutrality**
1. A demarcation line shall be fixed and both sides shall...

**[The text of this agreement has been truncated for ease of reference. The entirety of this document is available upon request]**

In brief, this agreement outlines the region of effect in which this agreement applies, and designates La Rue Macabre a "safe zone" wherein anomalous persons or entities can reside without interference by the Foundation. In return, the leadership of La Rue Macabre agree to maintain the Veil protocols to the best of their ability in and around New Orleans and to restrict overt use of their anomalous abilities to within the confines of La Rue Macabre. 

Additionally, this agreement outlines what constitutes a breach of this agreement and options to rectify such a breach by either party.
