title:bbaztek's Personnel File
**About:** bbaztek takes his name from the unsung hero of the Breaking Bad television series, Walter White's Pontiac Aztek. In a universe with an inexplicable hatred for windshields, someone has to transport our --beloved-- maligned protagonist around. The Pontiac Aztek is the car for that job. 

When he's not busy shoehorning the city of Boston into his articles, bbaztek can be found beside a pile of empty Red Bull cans slaving over a hot sandbox. I guess he has no life.
