**Do you, too, have a question (or questions) about Humes? Put them down below and they will be answered.**

**Q: What do areas of high (or low) Hume concentration look like?**
//-Dr. S//

A: An area of low Hume concentration is a very strange place indeed. Without the stability of ordinary reality, regular humans can alter the area to their whim, granting temporary reality bender-like abilities. These should not be confused with the real thing, of course; they are merely a projection of a higher-Hume frame of reference on a lower-Hume environment, and the "abilities" vanish as soon as the subject leaves the area. In addition, since reality is much less dense in these areas, the incidence of spontaneous anomalies and universe breaches are significantly higher. However, these anomalies/breaches do //not// vanish when taken from the vicinity. The reason for this is unknown at the current time.
An area of //high// Hume concentration, on the other hand...is a very strange place. To normal humans, it appears vivid and overpowering; a place of strong feelings and an unworldly (actually superworldly) aura. Remember how the Himalayas have a high Hume concentration? This applies to all mountains-there's a reason they're often sought out as a place of enlightenment. To reality benders, on the other hand, these areas are flat, grey, and earthy. Since the Hume concentration in these areas are usually close to (or higher than) the reality bender's own levels, they have significant trouble exerting their powers in these areas; in some cases being completely restricted from affecting the area. As such, reality benders tend to avoid these areas, instinctively or otherwise; and the currently-in-construction Site-35 (augmented with special Scranton anchors and located in the Himalayas) promises to act as effective containment for reality benders when completed.

**Q: Is it possible for a regular human to become a reality bender?**
//-Dr. S//

A: Yes; and there are many, many rituals and gimmicks that promise to do so (think penis enlargement spam, but promising a bigger Humedick.) However, the list of actual techniques to do so is very small; and is currently being compiled.

**Q: Is it possible for animals to have hume fluctuations as well?**
//-Dr. S//

A: Yes, certainly! At least one cat is suspected of it; a couple of dogs; and some fleas; and there is evidence coming in that certain whales may be capable of it as well. It is also hypothesized that inanimate objects are capable of this; but testing this has so far been difficult and the hypothesis is unsubstantiated.

**Q: Do we have any methods by which to test for hume fluctuations at a great distance, such as interplanetary or further?**
//-Dr. K//

**What are our options for detecting reality affecting entities at such distances?**
//-Dr. K// 

**Does being in the vacuum of space alter the nature of hume variance in any way?**
//-Dr. K//

**Are large and low Hume ratings expected to remain unusually high or low in parts or organs of a reality bender when detached or their user becomes deceased? Are there different Hume concentrations in certain organs rather than others? If so, which?**
//-Dr. R//

**Are there any noise or interfering "background signals" when measuring Hume concentrations in areas supposed to be "clean" of reality-bending effects?**
//-Dr. R//

**Has any cognitohazardous, infohazardous or memetic effect been related to alterations in Hume ratings? (To clarify: this is a question on the respective effects these agents have //on human psyche and brain chemistry//, and not on the various anomalous effects affected individuals may display after being exposed to them; that is, can information alone and its knowledge change Hume ratings?)**
//-Dr. R//

**Finally, this is partly a request. Several medical doctors and health officers of the Foundation Medical Branch have requested access to miniaturized Scantron Reality Anchors to test their prolonged effects on human beings, particularly on possible relation to altered mental states and the general well-being of operators and civilians. Is there any way to request acess to them for testing purposes or have these matters been looked into already? In case this has been tested, when will you publish a paper on it?**
