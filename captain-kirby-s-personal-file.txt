title:Captain Kirby's Personal File
Wow... I actually did it. I have one of these now. It feels so weird because like... I learned about this site like a month ago. At some point I'm going to upload a spoof SCP self insert here, because why not. But until then enjoy this other stuff!

I also would like to thank anyone who has ever looked at my work. I write for myself, but I get feedback and post my works for others to see it. So thanks for taking the time to let me entertain you.

The story of [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3305 The Father, The Son, and The Holy Toast]

This is by far the stupidest thing I've ever written. And it is also one of my favorites. It was originally inspired by /r/BreadStapledToTrees and it turned into an excuse to write a christian allegory about bread. This is also proof that, stupid can totally work on this site. Because that's what this is: gloriously stupid.

Also fun fact: the first picture I used for this site was given to me by someone who claimed to have taken the picture himself, but about an hour later I was told he just found it online. So I had to call up a friend of mine with a stapler at 10 at night to go staple some bread to a tree so I could get a CC picture.

**A Note About Comedy SCPs:** Just because the SCP itself attempts to be silly or funny does not mean that it does not belong on the main list. It is of my //personal// opinion that any type of SCP works as long as it is well written and entertaining (baring some exceptions). If I made you smile or laugh while reading this SCP, then I've done my job, and the same goes for any comedic SCP like [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3740 3740] or [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3304 3304].

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3650 Wanderlust] is my favorite serious SCP I've written.

I came up with the idea when I was listening to [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1fTRaCkeM Wanderlust Reprise by Renard]. I don't listen to much of his music, but I like this song, and it gave me the idea for an SCP based on the idea of getting people to go places. Then I looked through some old vacation photos and found some suitably creepy ones when I turned on enough filters. The rest of it just kinda happened.

[[collapsible show="Spoilers/My Headcanon for Wanderlust" close="Close Headcanon"]]

I know that there is some speculation on what actually is going on, so while I believe the only canon that matters is your personal headcanon, I'm still going to share mine with you. Because I wrote it. 

The photos were originally taken of Rem Z. while she was on her honey moon with Earnest Glint, and Rem wrote the haikus to go with the photos so she could remember the moment clearer. When Earnest killed Rem, she disappeared from the photos, and began to haunt those who'd look at them, asking them to bring her things. She feels like she had been cheated out of life, and doesn't like being alone with the pictures.

# [The Dog] Rem missed her dog from being alive
# [The Clock] Rem wanted more time to be alive. The D-Class represented time with a clock. Yeah, top tier symbolism. ikr?
# [The Lovely Bones] Earnest was a writer, and she loved his stories. Also, the book is about a girl who is murdered, but still wanders the earth.
# [The Suicide] Rem wanted someone to join her in the afterlife.

[[collapsible show="SCP-3481" close="Close Commentary"]]

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3481 Glorious Sounds] is the first SCP I wrote.

The story wasn't very well fleshed out and I'm not going to try to explain it. Although I do want to keep it around because I'm pretty happy with the way I did the Interviews.

[[tab About Me]]

+ Captain Kirby IRL

//Disclaimer: Identifying Personal Information has been redacted for privacy and security concerns.//

My name is [PERSONAL INFORMATION REDACTED] and I am a computer science major at [PERSONAL INFORMATION REDACTED]. I've been writing just stuff for years, and I've even self-published a novel (and will at some point self-publish a second one). However, I'm still quite the amateur. I'm probably best at writing comedies (like [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3305 SCP-3305]], but I've found myself attracted to writing horror. My first collection of horror stories that I enjoyed were by H.P. Lovecraft, who you should read if you haven't already.

I spend a lot of my free time doing robotics research and playing board games. I was part of a FIRST Robotics Team when I was in high school called [PERSONAL INFORMATION REDACTED]. I write entirely as a hobby, because I would like to build and program robots for a living. Sure, that may sound like a first grader's answer to "what do you want to be when you grow up", but robots are still the goal.

Alright... that's all I'm going to tell strangers on the internet. I hope you like reading my stuff! It's kinda flattering that anyone would even click on this part of my author page in the first place.

Thanks again for be at all interested in what I have to say. Or write. Or... you get the point.
