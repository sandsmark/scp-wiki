**Item #:** SCP-1069

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** The area in a 5 km radius surrounding SCP-1069 has been officially marked off-limits to civilian access due to supposed chemical contamination, and all Foundation staff on-site are to operate under the cover of an environmental cleanup organization.

Exploration or retrieval of artifacts from SCP-1069 may only be performed with prior permission from at least two (2) Level 4 Senior Research personnel. Personnel performing dives on-site must wear full soundproof ear protectors or modulated sound processing headsets at all times. Any civilians attempting to enter the protected area of SCP-1069 must be detained and questioned, and Class A Amnesiacs may be administered if necessary.

**Description:** SCP-1069 is a submerged city approximately 3 km off the coast of ███████, ████████, France at a depth of approximately 220 meters. SCP-1069 covers a region of approximately 4.8 km², and is surrounded by a high dike constructed of bronze and [REDACTED], indicating that the location may have once been a coastal city.

Dating of recovered objects and samples taken from SCP-1069 shows that it is at least ███ years old, but may have been built nearly ████ years before that. Measurements and reconstructions of the buildings indicate that the city would have been the largest one in existence during that time period, and the construction and strength of the walls and main city gate exceed the technological capabilities of any known civilization at that time as well. Further analysis has shown that most of the buildings have suffered extensive damage consistent with a large-scale tsunami and subsequent flooding, though the walls show none of the same damage. This indicates that either the main gate was intentionally opened, possibly by an attacking force, or a wave of sufficient height to crest the walls and flood the city hit the region. The latter seems less likely, as a wave of such magnitude would have left much more visible damage than has been found. Additional research is being performed on artifacts containing written script, which has been tenatively identified as a previously unknown Breton or Brythonic language.

Personnel within 5 km of SCP-1069 are subject to auditory and visual hallucinations, with the most common being the sound of tolling bells which are often heard from as far as the continental shore. Within the boundaries of the city itself, translucent figures can often be seen walking the streets of the city and engaging in hedonistic behavior within the halls of the eastern "Royal" district. These figures are ostensibly human, but their features are often blurry or unclear, and personnel have reported being able to catch glimpses of "demonic" features such as glowing eyes or horns when these figures are in peripheral vision. These figures usually do not acknowledge the presence of human observers, but have occasionally attempted to compel male personnel to join them in their activities.

SCP-1069 was discovered on ██/██/19██ by [REDACTED], who was on an expedition to locate and explore underwater ruins. Foundation agents embedded with local authorities were notified following the disappearance of three members of the expedition during [REDACTED].

Note: Wrecked submersible was recovered from the eastern district of SCP-1069, along with the clothes and personal effects of Drs. ██████ and ███████. No bodies or remains were recovered.

**Addendum 1069-02**: Supplementary Data

> A significant increase in auditory and visual hallucinations within SCP-1069 has been noted, particularly among staff who have been working with SCP-1069 for extended periods of time. Of special note is one reoccurring figure described as a "regal-looking" female figure, who has reportedly spoken to several staff and attempted to convince them to join "her party". I have ordered the worst affected staff to be temporarily detained for psychiatric evaluation, and am requesting additional containment procedures to be enacted to deal with this possible threat.

**Addendum 1069-03**: Supplementary Data

> On two separate excursions on ██/█/200█ and ██/██/200█, personnel performing dives on-site have positively identified figures matching the descriptions of missing Drs. ██████ and ███████ in the eastern district of SCP-1069. Personnel attempted to communicate with these entities, but were unable to elicit a response. Additional investigation is pending.
