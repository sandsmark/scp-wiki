**Item #:** SCP-395

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:**  SCP-395 is to be kept in the center of a locked room at least 10 meters wide. No women are to be allowed into SCP-395's room under any circumstances. The room is to be guarded by two men at all times. Any unusual behavior should be reported immediately. Any independent movement on the part of SCP-395 should likewise be reported.

SCP-395 is to be fed one litre of a half-and-half mixture of blood and milk, both taken from the same individual, once a week.


**Description:** SCP-395 is a human fetus, approximately 7 months into it's development, contained in a specimen jar. The jar is filled with a standard formaldehyde solution, with traces of blood.

When a woman gets within 5 meters of the jar, SCP-395 is able to telepathically influence her. At that point, the subject will feel a need to remove SCP-395 from it's jar, and allow it to feed in the normal manner. All women, regardless of age or medical status, will produce a small amount of milk under this telepathic inducement. Once the milk has been exhausted, SCP-395 will continue to feed, drawing blood and gnawing flesh from the subject. The subject apparently feels satisfaction throughout this process, only understanding what has actually happened when SCP-395 is sated and releases it's control.

SCP-395 was taken from a traveling freak show, whose owner had been using to to control women for his own personal use. It was discovered when police tracked the bodies of his victims back to him. One of the arresting officers fell under SCP-395's control, and killed her partner when he attempted to stop her from removing it from it's jar. SCP agents caught the report from the follow up investigation, and acquired SCP-395.
