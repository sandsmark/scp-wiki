**Item #:** SCP–482

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:**  The SCP was recovered during an experiment being conducted by Dr. Bright at ████████.  After initial containment, the SCP was turned over to Dr. Kamen for documentation and analysis.  Dr. Bright and Kamen are to be notified immediately should there be any changes to the SCP or any duplicates found.

While it is not being tested, SCP–482 is to be stored in Containment Locker ██, located at Site - ██.  Access to the locker is restricted to Level 2 Personnel and above; such access (and all activities thereafter) are to be logged and recorded within 24 hours of completion.  The maximum time limit for testing of SCP–482 is 1 hour after Time Point Beta (see description below); all subjects who have reached or exceeded this point while in contact with the SCP are to be immediately terminated.  SCP–482 is to be recovered first and separated from the subject’s body; localized thermal cleansing protocol is then to be performed on the bodies and any biological samples or personnel deemed contaminated by the test subject.  For further [DATA REMOVED].

**Description:** SCP–482 is a black leather straitjacket of similar make to the ███ brand.  Although the jacket seems to made for the Medium size, testing has shown that it can fit most body sizes; subjects with larger body types report, however, that they feel “compressed” or “suffocated” while wearing it.  The words “Made in Tsiao-yan, China / Hand Wash Only / No Aserejena Powder” are present on the manufacturer’s tag in faded text.  Neither the factory nor the item “Aserejena” exist on any known records.  Finally, while there are no obvious signs of wear and tear on the item, there are several small cuts on the straps.  Analysis has shown that these could not have been inflicted by anyone wearing the SCP in question.  Dr. ███ has stated that while the SCP seems to have some kind of invincibility, it only affects the one wearing it.  Further testing on this has been suspended due to the lack of viable testing duplicates for 482.

SCP–482 has two known effects, occurring in a linear fashion once the item is worn.  These have been identified as Time Points Alpha and Beta; experiments have shown that while the effects of Time Point Alpha fade after loss of contact with the SCP, those inflicted by Beta are permanent and are presently uncurable.  Further testing [DATA REMOVED].

Time Point Alpha refers to the first 3 hours that occur once SCP–482 is worn.  The item can be removed before Alpha elapses completely without ill effect.  During this period, the subject feels “mentally better”; any mental afflictions that the subject possesses, regardless of degree or intensity, are negated completely.  Any medication being taken by the subject has its effects completely negated as well.  The subject’s psychological testing has returned the results consistent with a normal, mentally healthy person.  Upon separation of the subject and the SCP, the mental illnesses return in full force, along with the side effects of any medication.  The benefits of Time Point Alpha seem to fade in a progressive fashion; however, the rate of occurrence has yet to be determined.

Time Point Beta refers to the subsequent time period that passes if a subject is still wearing SCP–482 once Alpha lapses.  During this period, the subject experiences physical mutation that seems to be determined by the nature of the subject’s mental disorder.  Should the subject have multiple mental illnesses, the mutations will manifest according to their degree of strength.  In addition, the subject gradually loses his/her mental cohesion and sense of identity, reverting to animalistic urges.  It is of particular note that despite this process, the straitjacket remains relatively intact throughout the mutation.  

Known mutations are listed as follows:

Notes:**

***

**Subject Gender:** Male
**Subject’s Known Mental Illness:** Psychosis/Schizophrenia
**Medication:** None
**Exposure (Alpha):** Subject reported being “eerily calm”.  Subject was noted as simply sitting and looking at the walls with a blank expression.  No other effects were noted.
**Exposure (Beta):** Subject’s body started to contort in random directions while he stated that he was experiencing great pain.  Eyes began to bulge and continued to swell as the subject’s skull increased in mass and size.  Ripping sounds could be heard as the mutation continued to progress.  Subject’s body began to increase dramatically in mass, although body growth was not symmetrical.  Teeth swelled in size and became more pointed; at this point, the subject was unable to close his mouth and drooled heavily in the testing area.  Subject then slammed his body against the testing cage, screaming incoherently while gazing wildly at random directions.  Termination order was executed at 34 minutes after Time Point Beta was reached.
**Notes:** Subject’s body was determined to have increased in mass by nearly 180% as of termination.  Most of the increase was bone and muscle tissue.  While no external source has been found to explain this growth, several genetic samples had abnormally shortened telomere strands.  Observers also reported experiencing a “deer in the headlights” sensation whenever eye contact with the mutated subject was made.

**Subject Gender:** Male
**Subject’s Known Mental Illness:** Dissociative Identity Disorder
**Medication:** █████████
**Exposure (Alpha):** Subject reported being “quiet in his head”.  Subject was noted as whirling his head around, exclaiming, “God-damn, this is better than the shit you gave me…I can’t hear them any more!”  Subject was removed from SCP–482 after 2 hours of exposure, whereupon he violently demanded to be in contact again with it.  After 30 minutes, Dr.  Kamen approved the return, and the subject continued to experience the mental calm listed above for 1 hour and 30 minutes more, at which Point Beta began to manifest.
**Exposure (Beta):** Mutation immediately began to manifest in the subject after Point Beta began.  Fleshy nodules began to appear on the subject’s ears, shortly thereafter breaking out into functional mouths no larger than 1/4th inch across.  Upon completing their appearance, these mouths began to communicate in a soft voice using an unknown language; subject, however, seemed to have no problem understanding what these orifices were communicating with it.  Subject was heard to exclaim, “Stop talking!  Get out of my head!” consistent with extreme instances of paranoia.  Bulges began to appear noticeably on the subject’s face, neck, and shoulder, spreading down to his arms, chest and legs before opening into mouths themselves.  Subject’s eyes and genitals seemed to have retracted, mutating into mouths as well.  Termination order was given at 25 minutes after Point Beta had been passed; by this time, at least 7 distinctive voices could be heard within the testing area, none of which belonged to the subject.
**Notes:** Of particular note is the fact that upon termination and recovery of the subject, there were enough fully grown teeth to fill each observed mouth to capacity.  Also, observers reported seeing shadows at the corners of their eyesight while hearing audio recordings of the subject during the Beta exposure period.
