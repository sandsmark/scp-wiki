//**Note:** --Contrary to popular belief among Site ██ personnel or complaints from Dr. Z████████ himself, Dr. Z████████ is not being spread too thin. Besides, he was the one bragging through 90% of his interview. -Dr. D███, Site ██ Command Level Personnel--//

//**Note:** --Yeah. Thanks D███. Now he's probably dead for all we know. -Agent S██████--//

//**Note:** --Dr. Z████████ has recovered from his encounter with SCP-███ and is filing the report as a of █/██/10. Dr. Z████████ is to be monitored weekly for possible lapses in health, change in appearance, or [DATA EXPUNGED]. -Dr. D███, Site ██ Command Level Personnel--//

//**Note:** As of █/██/12, Dr. Z████████ is back to semi-regular health, but must be monitored by site personnel at all times. In the event Dr. Z████████ begins glowing blue, evacuate that section of Site ██ and quarantine the area for at least twenty four (24) hours.// 

It should be of note that Dr. Z████████’s doctorate is in liberal arts. Dr. Z████████ has a limited scientific background and has, in fact, failed chemistry once in the past. In conversation, he wishes to retain his title as "Dr. Z" in that it is easier to say than Field Researcher Z████████.

//**Note:** To be fair, the only reason I failed chemistry the first time was because they never let me use a cheat sheet for the dimensional analysis conversions. --Thank God the Foundation lets me use them whenever I want.-- –Dr. Spaztique//

//**Note:** As of █/██/██, any personnel catching Dr. Z████████ using a cheat sheet are to report him to Dr. D███ or available Command Level Personnel for disciplining. –O5-█//

**Profile:** Dr. Z████████, aka Dr. Z or field name "Spaztique", joined Site ██ personnel on █/██/09. Dr. Spaztique is known to lapse between absolute professionalism, maintaining perfectly sober composure with no room for nonsense, and raw rookie energy, earning him his nickname. Dr. Spaztique tends to reserve this energy during his off-hours, but has occasionally used it while containing or obtaining SCP’s, sustaining injuries while containing SCP-███, and obtaining SCP-███ and SCP-███. Most recently, he was subjected to SCP-███ and is currently writing a report on the incident. 

Dr. Spaztique specializes in, --or at least wants to specialize in--, non-living SCP’s of any class. His reasoning behind this is from hearing many stories involving the dangerous decommissioning of these living SCP’s, wishing to keep Site ██ as safe as possible. Currently, the only living SCP assigned to Dr. Spaztique is [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-631 SCP-631], though more may be assigned to him in the future.

//**Note:** Personally, I didn’t want to keep SCP-631 on Site ██. It was Agent S██████’s idea. -Dr. Spaztique//

//**Note:** Quit being such a baby, Spaz. Besides, you signed up for this. Welcome to the Foundation, new blood. –Agent S██████//
