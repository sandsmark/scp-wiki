**Item #:** SCP-4200

**Object Class:** Safe/Neutralised    

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4200 has been successfully expunged from the historical record, due to the secretive nature of the Manhattan Project and extensive cooperation with the Foundation by the US government. Three individuals, all of whom were affected by SCP-4200, have been expunged from all records, and relatives to these individuals have been treated with Class-O amnestics.

SCP-4200-1's perimeter is surrounded by a three metre high solidified chain-link fence, at a continuous distance of ten metres from the area itself. Signs are posted at frequent intervals warning that the area is a former nuclear testing site, and thus contains hazardous radioactive waste.

**Description:** SCP-4200 is the designation for an anomalous event which occurred on the fourteenth of November, 1942 in the New Mexico desert. The event involved the detonation and subsequent malfunction of a weapon of mass destruction, constructed as a side project during the Manhattan Project, with anomalous technology salvaged from a site off the coast of Antikythera island, Greece. 

The believed series of events as is follows: the weapon was placed at a designated point, before being armed by three scientists - now identified as Timothy Noble, Erik Myers and Bernard Kamen. During countdown to detonation, the weapon malfunctioned and detonated early before the scientists were at a safe distance. The weapon, all three scientists, the vehicle they were travelling in, and a large amount of sediment seemingly instantly dematerialized from the site. US soldiers and Foundation operatives conducted extensive searches of the surrounding area, to no avail. 

The site of the detonation has been designated SCP-4200-1. This number designates an approximately 900m² area of land. SCP-4200-1 has been measured to have an abnormally low [http://www.scp-wiki.net/and-this-one-explains-humes Hume] level, with Kant counters recording readings of anywhere from 10-60 Humes. Individuals that spend extensive amounts of time in the area note that they have slowed reflexes, and are apparently drawn to three particular points in different areas of SCP-4200-1. This effect is believed to be both physical and psychological, as sand and other small objects have accumulated in large amounts at the aforementioned three points.

**Addendum:** The following is an audio transcript of the SCP-4200 event, recorded by Manhattan Project scientists. The audio is currently in Foundation possession.

**DATE:** 14/11/1942

**NOTE:** Audio log is transcribed approximately thirteen minutes into the testing, just after the weapon is armed. The three individuals were using handheld transceivers for communication.

**Test Command:** T minus 50 until detonation. 

**Myers:** Are you excited, Bernard? 

**Kamen:** Very. I can't wait to drop one of these on Hitler's doorstep. 

//The three laugh.// 

**Test Command:** 30 seconds. 

**Myers:** Hopefully the war will end before we need to, though. 

**Kamen:** Then what's the point? 

**Test Command:** 20 seconds. 

**Noble:** I agree with Erik here. It's good we've got this point, thank god for the site in Greece. Otherwise we wouldn-

//The weapon detonates. Myers, Kamen and Noble all vanish, along with the weapon and vehicle, which leaves a slight crater.//

**Test Command:** What the hell just happened? Erik? Tim?

//There is no response.//

**Test Command:** Someone go out there and report to me what the hell just happened. 

//There is silence for approximately four minutes while the test command attempts to deduce what occurred.//

**Noble:** H-hello? Command? 

**Test Command:** Where the hell are you?

**Noble:** I-I don't know. I can barely move or see. It's like something is weighing down on me from all sides. 

**Test Command:** Where are Myers and Kamen? 

**Noble:** I don't know. Shit. 

//Noble calls out for the other individuals.// 

**Kamen:** I'm here... fuck... I can't move at all. My arms and legs are s-stuck in somewhere. I don't know. 

**Noble:** Where's Erik?

**Kamen:** I can see him in front of me, just barely. He's not moving either. 

**Test Command:** We're going to try and figure out where you are and get you out. 

**Kamen:** I can't feel my heartbeat. I don't have a heartbeat!

**Noble:** We need to just st-

//A sudden cracking noise is heard.//

**Noble:** It's breaking my arm! Get us out of here, now!

**Test Command:** We don't even know where you are!

//More cracking sounds are heard. The three scientists begin to scream, including Myers who has seemingly awoken. This continues for around 50 seconds until the transmission cuts out.//

**Test Command:** We've lost them. I need a team on this, right now. Now!

++++ PERSONAL NOTICE FROM HEAD RESEARCHER SILVERS

Date of notice - 23/06/1998

[[/=]]
[[/div]]

As is often procedure with low-clearance files, the prior document omits pertinent information and contains purposeful inaccuracies. However, these were not deemed extensive enough for a full new document to go in the file for personnel with a higher clearance. 

The first aspect of note is the nature of the weapon involved in SCP-4200. From what we can tell from the documents that were able to be recovered (the staff on the Manhattan Project burned a great deal of files after the incident) the bomb was effectively supposed to create a minor reality bending effect. Space inside a chamber of the weapon would be "pinched" inwards, and then would violently react in the opposite direction, creating a large ripple which would destroy things in its path, with no radiation damage. The fact that an organisation other than the Foundation possessed reality bending technology isn't something that was deemed appropriate for lower classifications. 

The second is the location of Timothy Noble, Erik Myers and Bernard Kamen. While it is true that their exact nature and location in the multiverse is unknown, we have made contact (as much we could) and sent in a team. I've put the exploration log at the end of this message. Robert Scranton over at Site-120 sent us some devices, and when the Hume level was particularly low we sent an MTF in. They weren't in there for very long, but what the team picked up was certainly interesting.

**Exploration Video Log Transcript**

**Date:** 22/12/1989

**Exploration Team:** MTF-Alpha-5 ("Paranaughts")

**Subject:** SCP-4200-1 - Locating the three missing individuals involved in the SCP-4200 event

**Team Lead:** Gardner 

**Team Members:** Feynman, Asprey, Koehler

**Note:** Visual notes in this log were not streamed live during the exploration, but have been inserted in at the corresponding times. 
-----

[BEGIN LOG]

**MISSION COMMAND:** Is the team in place within SCP-4200-1?

**Gardner:** Affirmative. Can someone give me a Hume reading?

**Asprey:** 30 Humes. 

**MISSION COMMAND:** Make the jump now. If you stay any longer you'll be subject to SCP-4200-1's effect. 

**Gardner:** Is everyone in place? We'll have a span of around fifteen minutes to conduct our exploration before the devices reset and we are brought back. 

**Asprey:** Affirmative. 

**Feynman:** Good to go. 

**Koehler:** No issues here. 

**Gardner:** Activate, now. 

//The four members activate the devices, and visually disappear from the site.//

**MISSION COMMAND:** Was it successful? 

**Gardner:** I think so... it's hard to tell. Koehler, turn on your flashlight. 

**Koehler:** Right. 

//Koehler turns on his light, and reveals that the team is in a tight space around 1.5 metres in vertical length, surrounded by an unknown black material.//

**Feynman:** It's sort of... malleable. I can push it up with my hands but it moves slowly back into place. 

**Gardner:** Move forward. Our main aim is to find Myers, Noble and Kamen. 

//Feynman suddenly leaps back and yells.// 

**Feynman:** What the hell? 

**Gardner:** What happened, Feynman? 

**Feynman:** It's my Geiger counter. Look. 

//Feynman holds up his Geiger counter. It is now not a singular component, but several wires, circuitboards and plastic pieces.// 

**Koehler:** That's strange. It's like it broke apart perfectly. Mine seems okay. 

**Asprey:** Mine as well. 

**Gardner:** Leave it all here, Feynman. Everyone be careful, this place clearly has unusual properties. Stick together. 

//The team slowly move forward through the space. Asprey suddenly stops.// 

**Asprey:** I think I've found the vehicle. Look. 

//The team surround and study the vehicle, which is seemingly mostly embedded within the black material. Koehler runs his finger along it.// 

**Koehler:** I think this is rust. 

**Feynman:** How could that be? I don't think there's any water vapour present in here. 

**Gardner:** That is odd. However, we're not here for the car, we're here to find the three men. Keep moving. 

//The team continue onwards. Asprey's foot crunches on something.//

**Feynman:** What was that? 

**Asprey:** I'm not sure... Koehler, can I get a light? 

**Koehler:** Affirmative.

**Asprey:** It's... a pair of glasses. Did any of them wear glasses like this, Command? 

**MISSION COMMAND:** Yes, Myers did. You might be close. 

//The team continues forward, as the space begins to get taller. Gardner stops and raises his hand.//

**Gardner:** I hear something, be silent. 

//The team pauses. The sound of breathing is picked up.// 

**Koehler:** It's coming from the left. 

//Koehler shines his light to reveal the slumped form of Myers. One arm is seemingly inserted into the ceiling of the space. Five black, tube-like structures are attached to his head, which bond with the  black edges of the space, seemingly made of the same material.// 

**Gardner:** Command, we've uh... we've found Myers. 

**Feynman:** SCP-4200 happened what, 47 years ago? He doesn't seem to have aged at all. 

**Gardner:** Approach. We're going to make physical contact. 

//The team cautiously approach. Myers' eyes appear to be closed, but he is visibly breathing.// 

**Asprey:** He seems alive. 

//Apsrey places two fingers on Myers' neck.//

**Asprey:** There's definitely a pulse here.

**Koehler:** Maybe we should open up his eyes and try and wake him up. 

**Gardner:** Agreed. Asprey, open his eyelids. 

//Asprey proceeds to do this. Upon pushing Myers' eyelids open, Asprey suddenly jumps back as Myers seemingly jolts awake. His eyelids remain open.// 

**Asprey:** Look at his eyes...

//The camera is brought close to Myers' face, revealing that instead of typical eyes, images are seemingly playing in the space. Tanks and people running are seen. The pictures change to an individual resembling Nicolae Ceausescu (leader of communist Romania from 1965-1989). A red aura suddenly appears around him, before the pictures switch back to conflict on the streets.// 

**Feynman:** I see Romanian flags... this is Romania?

**Gardner:** Leave him. We need to try and locate the others. 

//The team continues forward. Eventually, Koehler's light reveals the form of Kamen. He is much more embedded in the black material, with both arms, 1 leg and a large amount of his torso seemingly inserted.//

**Gardner:** Command, we've found Kamen. Koehler, check his eyes. 

//Koehler opens Kamen's eyelids. The images shown are slightly different. The picture keeps showing various shots of communist Romanian forces being shot or captured.// 

**Asprey:** Gardner, how long do we have left? 

**Gardner:** Fuck. 90 seconds. Get some more footage and then move away. We'll come back another time to look for Noble.

//The team gather some more close-up footage before moving away.// 

**Feynman:** Why do you think their eyes were like that? 

**Gardner:** I don't know. We'll see what they say back at the site. 

//The team move into return positions, before being removed from the space, and visually reappearing back in SCP-4200-1.// 

**Gardner:** Command, we're back. 

**MISSION COMMAND:** Affirmative. A van is on their way to pick you up, exit SCP-4200-1.

[END LOG]

**Note:** After this excursion, the space has been designated SCP-4200-2.

**2:** On 13/05/2017, O5 command ordered an extraction of one of the three scientists from SCP-4200-2, carried out by MTF-Alpha-5. Tools were fashioned from the teeth and digestive system of [[[SCP-2742|SCP-2742]]] in order to remove one of the individuals from their embedded nature.

----
**DATE:** 13/05/2017

**NOTE:** Each team member carried two tools fashioned from SCP-2742 instances. An extra reality jump device was provided as well, to bring back the retrieved scientist. The updated devices do not have a 15 minute limit period, instead being manually activated to jump back, allowing for an indefinite stay. 
----

[BEGIN LOG]

**1318:** The team enter SCP-4200-1 and take their positions. All equipment is checked over for malfunctions. No abnormalities are found. 

**1319:** The team activates their jump devices and are transported successfully into SCP-4200-2. 

**1321:** One of the member's tools transmutes into the deceased head of an SCP-2742 instance. This is abandoned and the team continues. 

**1322:**  The team rendezvous. After considering prior excursions, it is determined that Myers will be removed, due to the fact that he is the one least embedded in SCP-4200-2. 

**1325:** The team find Myers' glasses, which have developed a coat resembling rust and become embedded slightly into the black material since the last time they were sighted. 

**1327:** The team's flashlights reveal the form of Myers a short distance away. 

**1328:** The team reach Myers, who appears to be unconscious. Lifting up his eyelids reveal black spaces, with no images playing. 

**1329:** The tubes attached to Myers begin to be cut by the tools. Incisions cause a black liquid to be spilled, which is immediately absorbed into the boundaries of SCP-4200-2 on contact. 

**1335:** After three of the tubes have been fully cut, Myers appears to be awakened. The team cautiously moves back. There is silence as he appears to simply stare at the team.

**1336:** Myers begins to writhe and yell out, feeling the back of his head frantically with his free hand. He looks off to the left, seemingly anxiously. 

**1337:** Two of the team restrain Myers while the others begin to cut the remaining tubes. Myers' eyes change to images of what appears to be desert. 

**1339:** The last tube is cut, and Myers begins to scream. The image in his eyes changes to that of a small building. 

**1341:** The team begins to cut a circle around the embedded arm of Myers. A red aura appears around the building shown in the eyes. 

**1344:** Communications with mission command are lost, assumed to be a technical malfunction. Myers becomes much more violent and attempts to push members of the team away. He is successfully restrained. 

**1348:** The cut is finished, and Myers falls onto the floor of SCP-4200-2, seemingly unconscious. The space where his arm was quickly fills in with more black material, leaving no trace of any damage. 

**1349:** A jump device is fitted around Myers' wrist, who is now seemingly unconscious. The team tries to contact mission command again, to no avail. 

**1350:** Myers and the team transport back to SCP-4200-1. The team awaits the arrival of a vehicle to retrieve them. 
-----

[END LOG]

At approximately 13:42 during the recovery of Myers, the mission command site suffered a catastrophic event. Several electrical wires malfunctioned, which sparked a large fire that eliminated communication devices and damaged large areas of the site. Seven casualties were recorded from the event. 

The team was eventually recovered by an excursion force from a larger site. Erik Myers was taken and analysed, but remains in a comatose condition. All attempts to remove Myers from this state have failed. Efforts are still ongoing.

**Item #:** SCP-4200

**Object Class:** Archon

**Special Containment Procedures:** Under the pretence of maintaining a sense of normalcy when it comes to the historical timeline, several false pieces of information have been placed at lower classification accesses of this document. Some of these include:

* SCP-4200 is the designation for the event which caused the 3 individuals to become embedded within SCP-4200-2
* The location of the three individuals is not known
* SCP-4200-A is in a comatose state from which he has not awoken 

It has been the unanimous decision of the O5 Council that the two remaining SCP-4200 individuals should not be recovered. This decision was made after the alterations to the historical timeline caused by the removal of SCP-4200-A. In the continuous interest in preserving a flow of time which aligns with the status quo, the remaining individuals are to be left permanently within SCP-4200-1.

The Hume count of SCP-4200-2 is to be monitored and any abnormally low counts are to be recorded, and then matching with corresponding world events to determine if SCP-4200 are influencing reality, and if they are, what they are influencing. 

SCP-4200-2 is surrounded by a three metre high solidified chain-link fence, at a continuous distance of 10 metres from the area itself. Signs are posted at frequent intervals warning that the area is private, protected property and contains large amounts of radiation due to previous nuclear testing. Experimentation with D-Class and Mobile Task Forces is currently prohibited. 

SCP-4200-A is held in a furnished human anomaly containment chamber. Amenities are permitted to be provided if requested. Historical textbooks given on request must have statistics of suffering, death or injury removed, as not to cause mental duress to SCP-4200-A.

**Description:** SCP-4200 is the collective designation for Erik Myers, Bernard Kamen and Timothy Noble (classed as SCP-4200-A, SCP-4200-B and SCP-4200-C respectively), who became merged with consensus reality after a malfunction during an anomalous weapon testing during the Manhattan Project. The weapon was designed to fold reality inwards for a brief moment before space would violently react in the opposite direction, which would create a large shockwave that could destroy large areas with no radioactive fallout. However, it is believed that the bomb accidentally ripped a small tear in reality instead of simply folding it.  

Due to their merging with the consensus reality, the SCP-4200 individuals possess the ability to influence world events in our timeline. They have the apparent ability to manipulate the actions and thoughts of people, as well as in a physical sense on objects and entities. SCP-4200 have been responsible for multiple major historical events, such as the USA's successful development of the nuclear bomb, the moon landing, and the breakup of the Soviet Union. The removal of any of the SCP-4200 instances from their state leads to the removal of their actions from the historical timeline. For example, the removal of SCP-4200-A from his merged state is believed to have caused the CIA supported coups in Chile, Guatemala and Brazil, among others, to come into effect in our timeline. 

SCP-4200-1 is the space in which two out of the three SCP-4200 individuals currently inhabit. SCP-4200-1 is a tear in reality, approximately 60 metres in diameter. The flow of time within SCP-4200-1 is not linear, and has been observed flowing backwards, erratically or simply not at all. The black material that makes up the boundaries of SCP-4200-1 is currently not fully understood. However, it is theorised to be a component which spontaneously forms due to a sudden lack of reality in an area. 

SCP-4200-2 is the site in which the event which caused SCP-4200 to become merged with the baseline reality took place. This designation spans an approximately 900m² area of land in the New Mexico desert. SCP-4200-2 possesses an abnormally low Hume level, with Kant counters recording anywhere from 10-60 Humes. A lower Hume count correlates with SCP-4200 exerting influence on baseline reality. Individuals that spend extensive amounts of time note that they have slowed reflexes, and are apparently drawn to two (formerly three, before SCP-4200-A was removed) particular points in different areas of SCP-4200-2, which correlate to the locations of the SCP-4200 while merged with reality. 

**Addendum:** The following are three selected interviews with SCP-4200-A. 

> **Interviewed:** SCP-4200-A
> 
> **Interviewer:** Head Researcher Silvers
> 
> **Foreword:** Interview conducted shortly after recovery from SCP-4200-1. Mental state of subject prior to interview was noted as being unstable and erratic. 
> 
> **<Begin Log>**
> 
> **Silvers:** Hello, Erik. Before we begin, is there anything you'd want?
> 
> **SCP-4200-A:** A glass of water, please. 
> 
> //Silvers gestures to a guard, and SCP-4200-A is brought a glass of water.//
> 
> **Silvers:** Can you describe the events preceding the malfunction of the weapon? 
> 
> **SCP-4200-A:** They put the bomb out in the middle of the desert with a van, and me, Tim, and Bernard followed in a car behind. We primed it, and then began to drive away. I don't remember what was said... I can only remember fleeting images after we armed it. Then there was a hum... a hum which I can't quite place.
> 
> **Silvers:** And then you awoke within SCP-4200-1? 
> 
> **SCP-4200-A:** I think we were unconscious for a while? Were we? 
> 
> **Silvers:** Kamen and Noble were unconscious for around five minutes. 
> 
> **SCP-4200-A:** Right. I woke up, and everything, for a few seconds felt numb... No, not numb. As if I was floating. But that didn't last long. Then it was just pain. 
> 
> **Silvers:** Can you describe that? 
> 
> **SCP-4200-A:** I can't really. The whole... place, whatever it is... twisted. My arm broke, I remember that. Past that, it was something deeper. It was like caustic acid on my skull that trickled down into everything else. //Pauses.//
> 
> **Silvers:** Are you alright? 
> 
> **SCP-4200-A:** Yes. I'm just trying to remember. After the pain, which lasted for an amount of time I cannot recall. Then came what I can only describe as... euphoria. 
> 
> **Silvers:** Euphoria?
> 
> **SCP-4200-A:** It came slowly at first. I started feeling things, pain, emotions. It trickled in, and it took me a while to realise that I was feeling things that other people, and things, were feeling and doing. 
> 
> **Silvers:** Could you influence events at this time?
> 
> **SCP-4200-A:** Not until I lost all sense of body. The trickles of the feeling became more and more, until the dam burst. Suddenly I was gone, my mind was in a place I could only describe as... everywhere. It was like I could feel the flow of history as it went. 
> 
> **Silvers:** And you could control things like this?
> 
> **SCP-4200-A:** Yes... At least, I think so. It's barely comprehensible to describe. Imagine everything that is, as a chess board of sorts. Suddenly, we could move the pieces. Fit things into the way we wanted them to. We didn't lose our thoughts about things, our biases, our opinions on the direction the world should be taken. We were thrust into a position where we could make those opinions a reality. 
> 
> **Silvers:** What was the first act that you did? 
> 
> **SCP-4200-A:** Of course, because we were scientists of the project, that was what we started with. We planted the seeds of knowledge about how they could build the atomic bomb. We didn't help with the defeat of the Nazis - that was happening anyway, and none of us were strong enough to do something like that at that point. 
> 
> **Silvers:** Did you gain more power as time went on?
> 
> **SCP-4200-A:** I don't think it was that we gained more power... It was more as if our influence, in a way, diffused. It took a few years to really grapple with the strength that we held. But Bernard...
> 
> //SCP-4200-A pauses and shuffles uncomfortably.//
> 
> **Silvers:** It's alright Erik. You can say whatever you'd like. 
> 
> **SCP-4200-A:** I... I don't... (//Pauses//). Doctor, how many people did my actions kill? 
> 
> **Silvers:** I'm not going to answer that, I'm sorry. 
> 
> **SCP-4200-A:** Please answer me. I know it... It must be thousands. There was Romania... All those soldiers didn't have a choice. I should have stopped Bernard, but I agreed with this cause. Even if I didn't for all the others. Tell me doctor, please!
> 
> **Silvers:** You're becoming agitated. We can continue this another time. 
> 
> **SCP-4200-A:** (//Sighs.//) Alright... Alright, but promise that you'll tell me how many, at some point.
> 
> **Silvers:** We'll see.
> 
> **<End Log>**
> 
> **Closing Statement:** SCP-4200-A was given brief psychological medical attention before returning back to containment cell. It was determined that giving SCP-4200-A statistics about his actions would cause unneeded duress. 

> **Interviewed:** SCP-4200-A

> 
> 
> **SCP-4200-A:** I think so. 
> 
> **Silvers:** Good, let's begin then. What can you tell us about Bernard Kamen? 
> 
> **SCP-4200-A:** I assume you already know all the baseline facts, where he was born, how old he was, that sort of thing? 
> 
> **Silvers:** You tell us what you think we should know. 
> 
> **SCP-4200-A:** His parents were born in the Ukraine, but moved to the US in around 1919, I think. They drilled it into him that he was lucky to be born in America, how it was the greatest country, that sort of thing. He carried those ideas all the way. 
> 
> **Silvers:** Was he well-liked amongst others? 
> 
> **SCP-4200-A:** Yes, Bernard was just... outspoken. Certainly more so than me or Tim. Confident, too. In the space, when he moved the pieces, you could really feel that he believed in it, completely. We should have done more...
> 
> **Silvers:** Did you and Noble actively oppose Kamen while inside SCP-4200-1?
> 
> **SCP-4200-A:** It's not that simple. Sometimes we did. Sometimes we didn't. Sometimes it was just one of us. I agreed with some of the things he put into action. Like the series of events with the Eastern Bloc. 
> 
> **Silvers:** What did you disagree with?
> 
> **SCP-4200-A:** Bernard is a very... extreme person. He hated socialism, in all forms. That was another thing that was drilled into him from a young age. He saw those governments in Chile, Guatemala, elect socialist leaders, and he felt he couldn't stand by. He tried to get the CIA to overthrow them, but I stopped him. I didn't agree with that. I'm not a socialist, but what he was trying to do wasn't right. 
> 
> **Silvers:** You stopped those events from happening? 
> 
> **SCP-4200-A:** Yes... what are you trying to say? 
> 
> **Silvers:** Erik, the CIA backed coups in the countries you mentioned did occur.
> 
> **SCP-4200-A:** That can't... You shouldn't have taken me out of there. Things that I prevented are now real. 
> 
> **Silvers:** Evidently so. 
> 
> **SCP-4200-A:** Look. Bernard isn't a bad man, he's just... Misguided. As I've said before, the transition in the space didn't make us lose who we were. It could have been anyone. You know how many different people they chose from to arm that bomb?
> 
> **Silvers:** I'm afraid I don't. 
> 
> **SCP-4200-A:** It was around 150 people. 150 different people each with their own opinions, political views, that sort of thing. But it was us...
> 
> **Silvers:** And how did they choose you three? 
> 
> **SCP-4200-A:** They didn't choose us. It was a random process. Completely random. None of us were really too important to the project. 
> 
> //SCP-4200-A chuckles.// 
> 
> **SCP-4200-A:** I guess we're important now. 
> 
> **Silvers:** What can you tell us about Timothy Noble, now?
> 
> **SCP-4200-A:** Can we continue this another time? I just need to rest. 
> 
> **Silvers:** Very well. 
>  
> **<End Log>**
> 
> **Closing Statement:** SCP-4200-A retreats to his cell. Interview scheduled for two days time. 


> **Interviewed:** SCP-4200-A
> 
> **Interviewer:** Head Researcher Silvers
> 
> **Foreword:** After cutting the last interview short, SCP-4200-A seemed eager for the beginning of the following interview.
> 
> **<Begin Log>**
> 
> **Silvers:** Well then, should we start where we left off?
> 
> **SCP-4200-A:** That seems like the best course of action.
> 
> **Silvers:** Tell me about Timothy Noble.
> 
> **SCP-4200-A:** Out of all of us, he was definitely the quietest. Unlike with Bernard, I didn't really know much about what he believed in, his political views. He grew up in a normal house, with normal American parents. 
> 
> **Silvers:** And did this translate over when he was inside SCP-4200-1? 
> 
> **SCP-4200-A:** In a way. He was slower to start, influenced smaller things in the beginning. But he did begin to expand his influence. At least, until Vietnam. 
> 
> **Silvers:** Vietnam?
> 
> **SCP-4200-A:** Bernard was doing what he thought was right. But this time, it was Tim that decided to stand up. But it changed him. You could feel the guilt and strife in him. 
> 
> **Silvers:** So Noble caused the struggles of the USA in Vietnam?
> 
> **SCP-4200-A:** He did, and he won. But as I said, it changed him. He became much more reserved. Sometimes you could feel he regretted opposing Bernard. His fellow countrymen, dead because of him. 
> 
> **Silvers:** Did he ever do anything on that scale again? 
> 
> **SCP-4200-A:** Never. After that he just kept to himself. Mainly helped science along its way little by little, research for diseases, physics, and that sort of thing. But every memorial that was placed up, it broke him more. Especially that one in DC, by that young girl. Her name escapes me. 
> 
> **Silvers:** Maya Lin, I believe. 
> 
> **SCP-4200-A:** That's the one. That deep scar across the ground. He felt that was his scar. 
> 
> **Silvers:** Do you feel guilty about what you did, Erik? 
> 
> **SCP-4200-A:** Of course. But I'd feel more guilt if I did nothing. I don't know how many lives I ended, but I like to think that more had been ended if I had just stood by. At least, I hope so. It's interesting to think about, isn't it? 
> 
> **Silvers:** What is?
> 
> **SCP-4200-A:** What the world might have been like if nothing ever happened, if the bomb didn't malfunction, or if we got to a safe distance before it did. Would more lives be ended, or would they be saved? 
> 
> **Silvers:** I suppose that is curious to think about. 
> 
> **SCP-4200-A:** The pure amount of events that had to coincide for everything to happen the way it did. But is that what history is? Chance? 
> 
> **Silvers:** You could look at it that way. Do you think that Noble and Kamen can continue their influences indefinitely? 
> 
> **SCP-4200-A:** I don't know. I'd say so. We obviously don't age in there. That space, it seems eternal anyway. Bernard and Tim are part of history now, like I used to be. You shouldn't have taken me out. 
> 
> **Silvers:** Because Kamen will now have less opposition? 
> 
> **SCP-4200-A:** Partly. History shouldn't be touched. It's happened, and there's nothing that can be done. But in removing me, you touched history. It doesn't sit well with me, even if I am grateful to now live as a normal person. I can't help feeling... a creeping sense of dread. 
> 
> **Silvers:** I see. That will be all for today. Do you have anything else to ask. 
> 
> **SCP-4200-A:** (//Considers//). No. Thank you, doctor. 
> 
> **<End Log>**
> 
> **Closing Statement:** SCP-4200-A's demeanour since this interview has been noted as stable, albeit slightly anxious. 


**Addendum.2:** On 12/08/2020, SCP-4200-A was found in a heavily panicked, unresponsive state, seemingly cowering underneath the bed in his containment cell. The following message was found inexplicably inscribed on the cover of a book they were reading. Investigations are ongoing. 

[[div style="float: center; border: solid 4px #444444; width: 570px; padding: 1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px; box-shadow: 2px 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);"]]

Erik, 

I don't know what that place is where they are keeping you. But it is cloudy. I'm not sure what those people have done there, but it keeps you tucked away. Your mind, too. You've sealed it off from me, and that I have to commend you for. The most I can do is leave this message. 

The world that you have returned to inhabit is a mess of corruption, suffering and death. I tried to implement what I willed to put it on the right path, so many times. But you and Timothy took it upon yourselves to try and stop this. You stopped so much progress. However, this will no longer continue. 

Timothy has agreed. He has seen that what I'm trying to do is the best course of action. I hope you can as well. You're not a bad person, you're just misguided. This message is an offering. If you let me in, I can guide you back. The three of us combined, all working on the same goal. It's been proven before that it can be glorious. 

We've made history so many times. But history is always ongoing. For people tomorrow, today is history. I'm giving you an opportunity to be part of something which will change it eternally. History is ours, forever and always. 

Your friend, 

Bernard.
