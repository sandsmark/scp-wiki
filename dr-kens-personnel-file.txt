**History:** Harking from a town in central New Jersey, Jacob Kensington grew up working with biological lab work, medical training, and engineering influences. After leading a small robotics team against other teams in an international competition and sequencing and analyzing dozens of unique DNA and protein sequences for a local university while in high school, he was accepted at Johns Hopkins for their Biomedical Engineering program and Medical Program. Having spent 8 years there, he graduated with a PhD in BME and an MD...after which he went back to get a PhD in robotics. He eventually got a job working with a start-up electronics company known as Psionics International, but after a few run-ins with various SCPs - and having successful contained them - he was contracted by the Foundation, where he currently works.

Following a lab accident on July 8th, ████, he lost his biological right arm. He was able to replace it with a prototype prosthetic arm that he'd been developing for the Foundation.
