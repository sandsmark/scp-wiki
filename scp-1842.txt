**Item #:** SCP-XXXX

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-XXXX-1 and SCP-XXXX-2 are to be kept in separate storage lockers in Site-82's Gamma Wing. Personnel wishing to conduct tests involving SCP-XXXX should submit the Experiment Request form to the current researcher staffed with testing SCP-XXXX, or the Director of Site-82's Gamma Wing.

**Description:** SCP-XXXX is a collective term that refers to SCP-XXXX-1 and SCP-XXXX-2, which  when combined, form a toy set.

SCP-XXXX-1 is a wooden toy microwave colored pink, purple, and yellow. SCP-XXXX-1 has no electrical components. The dials and knobs on SCP-XXXX are nonfunctional, and for all intents and purposes, SCP-XXXX-1 is a non-anomalous wooden microwave until SCP-XXXX-2 is used in it.

SCP-XXXX-2 refers to a clay-like substance, currently stored in 20 plastic jars, each containing a different color of SCP-XXXX-2 instance.  SCP-XXXX's anomalous effect occurs when SCP-XXXX-2 is molded into the shape of a food, and placed inside SCP-XXXX-1. After turning the dials, the interior of SCP-XXXX begins to glow, in a manner similar to that of a functioning microwave.[[footnote]] Where the dial is turned to has achieved no difference in results [[/footnote]]

After approximately 30 seconds, SCP-XXXX-1 produces a bell-tone. Following this, the door on SCP-XXXX-1 opens, revealing that the SCP-XXXX-2 instance placed inside has taken on the shape, smell, texture, and taste of the food in which it was originally molded into.[[footnote]] SCP-XXXX-2 post-cooking is referred to as SCP-XXXX-3  [[/footnote]] However, instances of SCP-XXXX-3 possess no nutritional value, and should not be consumed.

The Foundation Toxicology lab has confirmed that SCP-XXXX-2 is a toxic substance that causes vomiting, extreme nausea, headaches, and other symptoms consistent with lead poisoning roughly three minutes post-consumption. However, if the subject vomits SCP-XXXX-2, or if the substance is expelled through the subject's digestive system, all symptoms of SCP-XXXX-2 poisoning cease. This also applies to the ingestion of SCP-XXXX-3.

Tests have indicated that the output of SCP-XXXX-2 depends on what the user of SCP-XXXX-1 is thinking of. SCP-XXXX-1 will attempt to create the most accurate representation of the food being thought of, using SCP-XXXX-2 as a base to do so. See Testing Log SCP-XXXX-A for more information.

SCP-XXXX-1 is capable of replicating a currently unknown amount of food items. SCP-XXXX-1 is not limited to the functions of a normal microwave, and can produce things not normally produced in a microwave, such as cold dessert items, or elaborate foods.

||**Testing Log SCP-XXXX-A**||
> **Test 1**
> **Subject:** D-850392
> **SCP-XXXX-2 Shape:** A brown cone, topped with a pink sphere.
> **Results:** SCP-XXXX-1 produced one (1) strawberry ice cream cone. Subject reported that the dessert tasted bland.
>
> **Test 2**
> **Subject:** D-5315890
> **SCP-XXXX-2 Shape:** A more detailed version of the ice cream cone in Test 1. Sculpted to more closely resemble a strawberry ice cream cone.
> **Results:** SCP-XXXX-1 produced one (1) strawberry ice cream cone. Subject reported that the dessert was delicious.
> //Notes: We can conclude that detail with which SCP-XXXX-2 is molded affects the taste and quality of the food produced. -Dr. Louef//
> 
> **Test 3**
> **Subject:** D-9013241
> **SCP-XXXX-2 Shape:** A solid brown cube. Subject is told to think of pasta when operating SCP-XXXX-1.
> **Results:** A brown cube that resembles an extremely compact cube of fettucine pasta. D-9013241 reported that the texture was extremely hard to palate, due to the compact nature of the cube.
> 
> **Test 4**
> **Subject:** D-5382901
> **SCP-XXXX-2 Shape:** A detailed reconstruction of a Lobster Thermidor.
> **Results:** SCP-XXXX-1 produced a highly accurate Lobster Thermidor dish. Subject reported that the dish was excellent, and "the best meal that I've ever had."
> //Notes: There doesn't seem to be a limit to what SCP-XXXX-1 can produce in terms of food, even with extremely complex dishes. -Dr. Louef//
> 
> **Test 5**
> **Subject:** D-1251789
> **SCP-XXXX-2 Shape:** A green sphere. Subject was told to think of diamonds.
> **Results:** SCP-XXXX-1 ran normally, but the SCP-XXXX-2 instance was not changed.
> //Notes: SCP-XXXX only seems to be capable of producing food items. -Dr. Louef.//
> 
> **Test 6**
> **Subject:** D-678923
> **SCP-XXXX-2 Shape:** A detailed anatomical representation of a human arm. Subject was ordered to visualize human flesh.
> **Results:** SCP-XXXX-2 did not change.
> //Notes: Evidently, SCP-XXXX-3 can only be produced if the user believes that what they are imagining is food, even if the mental image is edible.//
> 
> **Test 7**
> **Subject:** D-678923
> **SCP-XXXX-2 Shape:** A black representation of a gun
> **Results:** Originally, D-678923 was ordered to use a representation of black licorice. However, D-678923 quickly  remolded it into a gun-shape, and used SCP-XXXX-1 before guards could stop him. Subject was terminated by guards while waiting for SCP-XXXX-1 to finish. The aforementioned SCP-XXXX-2 mold was later tested, and found to fire licorice at the the approximate muzzle velocity of a toy dart gun.
