    **Item #:** SCP-637

    **Object Class:** Safe

    **Special Containment Procedures:**SCP-637 is to be held at Site 17 in a room containing one wooden bookshelf of Agatha Christy novels (at request of subject), one bed with mattress, sheets, blankets, and pillow, one cushioned reclining chair, and SCP-637. Anything the subject requests is to be given, as long as they do not violate procedure. However, any requests for pencils, pens, sketchpads, or any marking implement, are to be denied and reported to Dr. ████████████. 
(The issue has been raised that if SCP-637 wanted marking devices, it could use a fluid such as blood or urine, but the subject has not displayed a marked interest in drawing. It is agreed, however, that it is wise not to tempt fate.) 
Subject is to be fed 3 times per day and whenever it requests food.


    **Description:** SCP-637 is an elderly Caucasian woman of approximately sixty-five (65) years of age, who calls herself “Margie”. “Margie” has been described as “polite and old lady-ish, if a little confused”, who spends much of her time in a semi-catatonic state with occasional lapses of lucidity. SCP-637 is the host of SCP-637-A, a psychic organism which subsists entirely in SCP-637’s mind. SCP-637-A is described by its host as “a little black cat, skinny fellow, real easy-going”. Although the creature normally resides in a “blank space” in a subject’s mind, it is capable of residing for several minutes as a drawn item on paper, wood, or other substance. If any sentient organism not previously carrying SCP-637-A sees the reproduction, the image will vanish, and SCP-637-A will leave their previous residence and take up residence in the new subject’s mind. 
SCP-637 does not recall where she saw SCP-637-A originally, so it is assumed to have been living in her mind for some time. 

SCP-637 is capable of reproducing the creature adequately on paper, where at one point a test subject was exposed to the image. Subject ████, described before the experiment as “moderately bright”, was quarantined immediately after, and during quarantine gained a disparaged appearance and made comments like “Nothing works… Isn’t working… Nice kitty… Get me out… Want that damned cat out of my head…”, for several hours. 

When told he would remain in quarantine for an additional 24 hours, Subject ████ reacted violently but not explosively, or in anything beyond normal human range. After loudly cursing the guards for several minutes, the subject subsided into a catatonic state, drifting in and out of consciousness for the next forty-eight hours. After unusual behavior was deemed not harmful, the subject was given a low-security dormitory in the site. The subject soon unexpectedly self-terminated using the broken edge of a ceramic dish, yelling “Get the cat out! Leave me alone! I want the cat out!” and commenting that the cat was a "brain-sucking parasite" before dying.
It is worth noting, that immediately after Subject ████’s termination, SCP-637, who had been sleeping peacefully at the time, sat straight up and exclaimed, “Kitty’s back!”

Unless further experimentation is warranted, it is recommended that we prevent SCP-637 from releasing SCP-637-A onto paper, in order to maintain the good mental condition of our agents.

SCP-637-A, based on information gathered from SCP-637 and subject ████, behaves exactly as a normal cat, and its host is always capable of describing what it is currently doing and where it is within their head. 

SCP-637 is liked by several of the staff and shows affection for the theoretical creature.

    **Addendum:**
Dr. ████████████ believes the creature could be useful, including the possibility of mass-producing the cat and adapting it for use in psychic warfare as a means of crippling the subject, and plans to continue testing on other subjects. If no uses are found for SCP-637-A, then it is believed that it will die when its host does.
