**Item #:** SCP-2706

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** The area of SCP-2706 is to be fenced off with at least two patrols guarding the perimeter at all times.  Should an instance of SCP-2706-2 be located, it is to be retrieved and released into its natural habitat.  MTF λ-6 (Elmer Fudds) are to be equipped with standard tranquilizer firearms when searching for an instance of SCP-2706-2.  

If any instance of SCP-2706-2 becomes hostile and detrimental to the survival of MTF λ-6, then the mobile task force has full authorization to utilize any firepower available within Area-37 armory.  Should an instance of SCP-2706-2 be too dangerous for normal engagement parameters then Procedure 442 Kito-Fas is to be enacted.  

**Description:**  SCP-2706 is a white oak (//Quercus alba//) forest located thirty-six kilometers east of Clarksburg, West Virginia. The trees located within SCP-2706 (known as SCP-2706-1 instances) are unusually sturdy (with the density of an individual instance measuring 44.32 cm/g^^3^^). All SCP-2706-1 instances have between 3-10 abnormal growths (similar in appearance to burls) attached to their trunk.

Periodically these abnormal growths will produce an organism of the //animalia// kingdom (referred to as SCP-2706-2 instances) through a process that is not fully understood. SCP-2706-2 instances are produced at different stages of development and are anatomically normal. All attempts to remove an SCP-2706-2 instance from an instance of SCP-2706-1 have resulted in the death of the organism.

SCP-2706 was first recovered when the corpse of a bottle-nose dolphin (//Tursiops truncatus//) was found in the area. Local authorities subsequently discovered a number of non-native animals in the area, including a pair of cheetahs, a kangaroo, six penguins, an anaconda, and two rhinoceros.  All animals recovered were re-released into their natural habitat. Assets embedded in local law enforcement notified the Foundation, which established Area-37 in order to contain further SCP-2706-2 instances.

> ++++ **Addendum 1**
> 
> On August 17, 1972 a human instance of SCP-2706-2 was produced and discovered by MTF λ-6.  SCP-2706-2 was naked, in the advanced stages of shock and was given medical treatment.  SCP-2706-2 claimed to be Jeremy Monroe (a botany student) from Hillsdale, Iowa. Government records indicate that SCP-2706-2 had previously died in an automobile accident on December 24, 1954.

> ++++ **Incident Report 013**
> 
> During a patrol on May 8, 1983, a member of the species //Mammuthus primigenius// (Woolly Mammoth) was discovered attempting to escape SCP-2706 by MTF λ-6. The Mobile Task Force quickly tranquilized the instance and called for air retrieval.  SCP-2706-2 is currently within Foundation Reserve-32 where it is being studied.  Anatomical examination between SCP-2706-2 and records of [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2082|SCP-2082]]] are currently underway.  
> 
> Follow up investigation has indicated that this instance emerged from a growth originally thought to be non-anomalous due to a lack of activity since the beginning of containment in 1951. Several other growths in the same area are currently under observation for additional production events.

> //This is the first SCP-2706-2 recorded that is not from the present day and the growth it appears to have originated from appears too small to accommodate it.  I want MTF Lambda-6 to be equipped to deal with any creature of any size inside SCP-2706.//

> ++++ **Incident Report 102**
> 
> Following incident 013, growths which were inactive for long periods of time were placed under continuous surveillance. On October 30, 2014, 3 of these growths produced instances of SCP-2706-2 that appeared and acted in a manner consistent with currently contained instances of SCP-███.  MTF λ-6 called in airborne support to locate SCP-2706-2 instances.  Following several failed attempts at containment, MTF enacted Procedure 442 Kito-Fas.
> 
> Members of MTF λ-6 utilized vehicles to lure 2 of the 3 SCP-2706-2 instances into a designated kill zone manned by MTF Nu-7 (Hammer Down).  MTF Nu-7 was able to terminate both instances by utilizing Mark 77 incendiary bombs.
> 
> MTF λ-6 ground forces encircled the third SCP-2706-2 instance inside SCP-2706. MTF Nu-7 provided close air support during this engagement.  After encircling the SCP-2706-2 instance, both forces engaged in a firefight which, after 2 hours and 12 minutes, was deemed successful in neutralizing the instance.
> 
> SCP-2706 suffered immense damage to its southern section, with multiple trees completely uprooted and a large loss of immature SCP-2706-2 instances.  It is estimated that 15% of SCP-2706 is no longer viable for producing for SCP-2706-2 instances.

> ++++ **Addendum 2**
> 
> Observations of extant SCP-2706-1 instances have shown that the length of inactivity observed in a growth is at least tangentially related to the danger posed by the produced SCP-2706-2 instance. 
> 
> Though at least 6 growths have been inactive for more than a decade, following incident 102, only one growth remains that has been inactive since before initial containment. Attempts to examine the interior of this growth through non-invasive means have been thwarted by the unusually high levels of radiation emanating from within it.
> 
> The viability of termination attempts relating to the immature SCP-2706-2 instance contained in this growth are under discussion. Please see Dr. Jeremy Monroe for more details.
