**Item #:** SCP-953

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-953 may be maintained in a minimum security environment suitable for any other human or humanoid SCP at any site of its choice. Following extensive negotiations, SCP-953 has agreed to cooperate with Foundation personnel assuming several demands are met. Additional requests are to be immediately related to O5-█ for review. Do not, under any circumstances, respond to any requests made by SCP-953, no matter how outlandish, in the negative.

Because of SCP-953's imperious personality, Class D Personnel are not to be used in interactions with the subject except as listed below under Subsection A. All staff assigned to SCP-953 must have Level 1 or higher security clearance, are required to take a polygraph test on a weekly basis, test better than 99% on the Kant-Livington Xenophobia Resistance Scale, and must undergo a six-week orientation program before being allowed to come into contact with SCP-953. Further requirements are listed under Appendix 953-C: Personnel Traits.

Given the violent reaction of SCP-953 to any personnel of ████████ ethnicity or descent (see Appendix 953-V: Prior Incidents, Casualties Resulting From), no staff of said ancestry are to be used in interactions with SCP-953 except under subsection A.

As of ██-██-████, SCP-953's accommodations consist of a four-room suite (bedroom, bathroom, living room, kitchen). The kitchen is to be fully stocked with fresh food (see Appendix 653-A: Dietary Preferences) at all times. A supply of traditional █████████ ███ ████, (████) is to be provided at all times. Under no circumstances is ███████████ ████ ████, (███) to be provided as a substitute (see death and mortality report on incident [DATA EXPUNGED]). 

In addition to dietary needs, SCP-953 is to be provided with any entertainment desired: this is to be considered a Level 10 directive, given the subject's violent reaction to ennui. Staff assigned to SCP-953 should be prepared to engage in any sort of entertainment requested by SCP-953 including, but not limited to, traditional card/board games, gambling, the sharing of alcoholic beverages, performance of live music, the acquisition of television programs, video games, music, or other entertainment media, and/or sexual contact, regardless of gender/orientation. Failure to immediately comply with a request for entertainment is grounds for termination (See Appendix 953-V: Prior Incidents, Casualties Resulting From).

Personnel assigned to SCP-953 are to turn in all weaponry prior to joining the project. Attempts to control SCP-953 through any means have a 99% chance of triggering a violent reaction: for this reason, lethal containment protocols similar to the explosive collar employed in the case of [[[scp-076]]] are verboten. 

SCP-953 is to be allowed open access to any area of Foundation facilities desired, save the following: any area with a high probability of contact with any male human or humanoid SCP (eg. [[[scp-073]]], [[[scp-182]]], [[[scp-151]]]). Should SCP-953 express a desire to enter such an area, personnel are instructed to immediately relay the request to O5-█, and are reminded never to respond to any request made by SCP-953 in the negative. SCP-953 may be allowed contact with female human or humanoid SCPs (eg. [[[scp-166]]], [[[scp-327]]]) but should do so only under close supervision by an O5-█ trained moderator, due to the risk of bodily harm or death to either or both parties.

Do not, under any circumstances, allow SCP-953 to come into contact with any of the following: [[[scp-076]]], [[[scp-053]]], [[[scp-073]]] or any other SCP listed under Appendix 953-AC: Forbidden Contacts.

//Subsection A:// According to the terms of the agreement, SCP-953 is to be provided with one (1) male Class D personnel for consumption on the first of every month. The Class D personnel in question must have abstained from alcohol, tobacco, and/or other controlled substances for a period of 365 days prior to this as outlined under Appendix 953-A: Dietary Preferences. SCP-953 is to be provided uninterrupted solo access to said Class-D personnel as long as is required.

//Subsection A, Addendum:// All further Subsection A requirements shall be carried out in a soundproof, tiled chamber with a drain. Staff are to be on-hand with cleaning supplies to immediately respond following completion of Subsection A requirements. Staff assigned to this duty are required to review standard Foundation protocol for Biohazard Level 1 environments, given the copious amounts of blood and human tissue that are guaranteed to be present.

**Description:** SCP-953's most common appearance is that of an ████ female of specifically █████ descent between 12 and 30 years of age.  It generally appears dressed in outdated fashions circa 1600, although it sometimes chooses to take a more modern appearance, especially around male personnel between 18 and 40 years of age.  However, SCP-953's polymorphic qualities make it difficult to classify its appearance, especially given its preference for quickly switching its chosen form when it perceives a lack of attention among its observers. 

It appears to derive some amusement from startling its assigned staff with pranks and practical jokes: staff are advised to play along lest it choose to alleviate its ennui by other means (see casualty report re: Agent ████ "Iceman" ████████ in Appendix 953-V: Prior Incidents, Casualties Resulting From). Despite this fact, it can easily be recognized by ███ ███████ █████████ ██ ████ ███ ███ ████ ███ █████, █████ ████ ██ ███████ ██ ██ █████ ██% ██ ███ ██████ █████ ██ ███████ ████ ██ ███████ ██ ████.  For this reason, it is not easily disguised as inanimate objects, and can easily be recognized if it chooses to do so.

Retrieval was carried out by thirteen (13) Foundation personnel on ██-██-████ in the ████████ region of ████ ████, following reports by local civilians of [DATA EXPUNGED]. Through the use of a live [DATA EXPUNGED] as bait, Foundation personnel were able to engage and capture the entity in question. The operation had an acceptable 50% casualty rate (see Appendix 953-V: Prior Incidents, Casualties Resulting From). It was transported to [DATA EXPUNGED] on ██-██-████ by armored transport: during the three hour trip, ██ casualties resulted through strangulation, dismemberment, forced sexual auto-penetration of the ████, asphyxiation through ██████████████, and ████████████: a complete list can be found under the aforementioned Appendix 953-V.

SCP-953 was responsible for over ██ casualties over the next ██ years, as well as █ escape attempts, three of which necessitated re-retrieval missions to the ████ peninsula to return it to captivity (again, see Appendix 953-V: Prior Incidents, Casualties Resulting From). Although slated for termination, all attempts to do so resulted in further violence and the deaths of Foundation personnel. In ████, O5-█ (then known as Assistant Director █████), ordered a change in tactics from termination to control, based on the psych profile carried out by Dr. █████████████. Containment was finally achieved on ██-██-████ by O5-█: (see Appendix 0: Report by O5-█ Re: Methods used in the Containment of Subject SCP-953, for details), resulting in the current Special Containment Procedures.

SCP-953 displays several remarkable properties, including [DATA EXPUNGED]. Because of its obvious threat to the general public, it cannot be allowed to leave Foundation facilities.  Thankfully, it seems content at the moment to remain in its assigned SCP facilities,

**Addendum 953-a:** Following a television commercial for ████ Computers, SCP-953 has expressed interest in obtaining one for its own, with internet access. Request forwarded to O5-█ for review and approval/veto.

**Addendum 953-b:** Log of Online Conversation re: Personnel assigned to SCP-953. Names redacted as per General Directive ███.

> MR (██-██-████ at ████:██:██): Condolences to be sent to ████████'s parents using standard cover story of accident at [REDACTED].
> 
> DL(██-██-████ at ████:██:██): Does anyone know what the hell caused this?
> 
> AL(██-██-████ at ████:██:██): As far as I can tell, it started when ████████ called her a ███████ instead of a ██████. She went off on a complete psycho rage, screaming about how she never agreed to bow down to some asshole ████████ ████ ███ and that she wasn't going to stand for being insulted like that. One moment, she's happily drinking with us, the next she's threatening to kill everyone on the base unless she gets a formal apology.
> 
> DL(██-██-████ at ████:██:██): Damn it! This is why I've been trying to revise the personnel recruitment requirements: limiting staff to people not of ████████ descent isn't enough when everyone and his mother watches that stupid ████ bullshit! Or had you forgotten the time some moron decided to make a reference to that dumb [REDACTED] cartoon they were playing on [REDACTED]? Not to mention the time that we assigned ██████ to the case without realizing he was a [REDACTED]. How come we can afford a [DATA EXPUNGED] that costs ten billion dollars, but we can't pay a [REDACTED] folklorist $███ an hour to tell us how to deal with her?

> SCP-953 (██-██-████ at ████:██:██): In the days of my childhood, your disrespectful behavior would have resulted in swift death. I would have eaten your liver raw while you still lived to see it. I should do so now, but out of respect for //[Translation Impossible: Best estimate, "he who tamed me"]//, I shall demur. 
> 
> DL: [DATA EXPUNGED]

> SCP-953 (██-██-████ at ████:██:██): You bore me, sub-creature.  I will speak no further with anyone save he who tamed me. You have one minute to comply.
