**Item #:** SCP-037 

**Object Class:** Safe 

**Special Containment Procedure:** SCP-037 has an immense gravitational field which it can dilute and polarize allowing it to hover at different heights from the earth's surface (See Appendix #0245). It is contained in a small room comprised of one (1) meter thick heat/radiation-proof glass. Should the integrity of the glass become compromised, the emergency system will generate a low power argon plasma shield until it is repaired. Those repairing the glass should wear a heat resistant biosuit provided by site personnel to avoid heat stroke. 

**Description:** Artifact was first noted in ████████████, Sweden in 19██ hovering above a small cottage. The owners a nearby property had been complaining that their neighbor's lights were always on and it was too bright out at night. The neighbors, however, had moved out months before and the house no longer had electricity. Upon arrival, agents discovered a minuscule white dwarf star. Through Arkangecian Gravitational Discharge (See Appendix #7896), it was safely transferred to Site 23. 

SCP-037 is a star exactly 5 centimeters (2 inches) in diameter which emits one (1) billionth the amount of light our sun produces. The age of SCP-037 is currently unknown however it's nuclear activity is being carefully monitored, should it exhibit any dangerous irregularities. It's origin is thought to be the result of a corrupt hadron collider experiment in ██████████. 

The artifact is currently not accessible to any agent without at least Level 3 clearance (See Document #82-3.) 

**Document #82-3:** //It has come to my attention that some attendants have been toying with SCP-037. The glass floor leading to SCP-038 is now covered in roasted marshmallow, tanning oil and various amounts of ash from burnt objects. I am now forced to bar access to all attendants who do not have Level 3 clearance.//

**Appendix #0245:** The existence of polarized gravitational forces was suspected, but unconfirmed until the discovery of SCP-037 which seems to not only be able to attract masses but repel them as well. This is in agreement with other forces such as magnetism and electricity which also have attractive and repulsive relationships with particles with said properties. The case of SPC-037 is interesting because we have been unable to distinguish any differences in the particles of mass that SPC-037 attracts and repels. It seems to almost be a matter of choice, though SPC-037 shows no other examples of sentience.

**Appendix #7896:** The techniques behind Arkangecian Gravitational Discharge are ██████████ ███ █████████ and are also able to ████████████ █████ ██████████████████ ██ without damaging the █████████████████ that is █████ ███████ ██ and makes the practice possible. Without ███████ ██ and the availability and security inherent in ███ ██████ ███ █████ the ███████████ would be too dangerous to attempt in ███ ███████ ████████.
