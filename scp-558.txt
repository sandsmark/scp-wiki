**Item #:** SCP-558

**Object Class:** Safe/Euclid (SCP-558-3 only)

**Special Containment Procedures:**

All items comprising SCP-558 are to be kept in their cases in Equipment Cabinet ██-█ at Research Site-██. Any personnel wishing to experiment with SCP-558-1 and SCP-558-2 may do so after completing standard documentation. Researchers wishing to test SCP-558-3 must either themselves have Level 3 Clearance or have the written approval of at least two Level 3 personnel. At this time it is advised that only Class D personnel be allowed to interact with SCP-558-3.

**Description:**
SCP-558 includes a number of different types of colored contact lenses, divided by researchers into SCP-558-1, SCP-558-2, and SCP-558-3 by apparent properties. Currently there are ten (10) of each contact lenses comprising SCP-558-1 and SCP-558-2 and six (6) contact lenses comprising SCP-558-3. These lenses have no corrective power (often called Plano), with a base curve of 8.4 and a diameter of 14.0. Testing is currently underway to determine the composition of the material without damaging the lenses. Test subjects with eyes not matching SCP-558's specifications have reported discomfort, though in some cases it has still been possible to wear them. Rather than standard clear or slightly tinted, each lens has a colored central portion slightly wider than the average human iris. SCP-558-1 lenses have an iridescent center that shifts when viewed from different angles, SCP-558-2 lenses are gray, and SCP-558-3 lenses are black. SCP-558 was found in a toiletries case in the bathroom of room ███ of the ████████████ █████████ hotel, during a raid called in to investigate reports of [DATA EXPUNGED]. The saline solution found accompanying SCP-558 was determined to be normal, so any standard solution may be used. No other extraordinary items were found in the bathroom.

SCP-558-1 was the first type to be tested. Testing with these lenses met with initial difficulty as subjects immediately complained of very bright light even when they closed their eyes. Repeated testing in different locations finally revealed that these lenses allow a wearer to visually perceive electromagnetic emissions outside the range of visual light. Since the Earth is usually blanketed with radio-wave communication (which passes through flesh eyelids), these most often display a great amount of light. In shielded underground facilities, however, it is easier to manage, provided inter-facility radio communication is restricted. Subjects reported seeing infrared radiation in a way similar to night vision goggles, though the color seen was not exactly red. Test subjects have expressed great difficulty in expressing the colors seen, but they are adamant that the lenses do not simply convert light. Several test subjects have become violent in frustration after repeated questioning to describe the exact color of nonvisible light. Ultraviolet lights were also visible, and test subjects were able to see X-rays coming from a nearby medical examination room. Testing with gamma rays is being planned, though researchers are unsure if they might harm SCP-558-1. Vision was not impaired in the visible spectrum, though test subjects reported an unparalleled vividness of color and clarity in normally dull objects. A Class D personnel with a history of drug use reported a similar experience to the use of some hallucinogens, though much more consistent and vivid. So far the only adverse effects observed have been headaches from wearing SCP-558-1 too long and eyestrain after looking at particularly colorful objects and exposure to high-power radiation sources.

//(NOTE: After testing of SCP-558-2 revealed the ability to exercise personal agency over the abilities of an SCP-558 object, further testing on SCP-558-1 revealed that approximately one (1) in three (3) subjects was able to narrow the scope of their vision from all spectra to specific wavelengths. Subjects have also been able to dim the intensity of light seen, which has been especially helpful in outdoor testing. This control requires a great deal of constant concentration and invariably induces migraines, though in certain subjects, the negative effects seem to decrease with practice.)//

SCP-558-2 was tested second. Subjects wearing lenses from this group report being able to see only in gray-scale. However, it was quickly noticed that somehow, subjects' field of vision had been expanded. While normal humans have 140° field of binocular vision with 40° peripheral vision (20° each on the right and left), testing indicated subjects' binocular vision covered 210°, while their peripheral vision covered an additional 60° (30° each on the right and left). Test subjects experienced severe vertigo when moving for approximately the first thirty (30) minutes of wearing SCP-558-2. After adjusting, subjects were able to move around without difficulty and were pleased by the greater visibility, though most complained of headaches. Subjects also reported that their distance vision seemed sharper, even those subjects who had possessed 20/20 vision naturally. When Professor Skali █████████ theorized their increased field of vision is due in some way to a "bending" of perspective (which Dr. ██████ claimed to be ridiculous), researchers asked test subjects to attempt to focus on an open doorway. Approximately one (1) in three (3) subjects was able to "bend" their vision around a corner and see a brief glimpse into the hallway. All subjects attempting this, even those who failed, experienced mild to severe migraines immediately afterward. Testing to take advantage of these abilities is ongoing, though a method of coping with the negative side effects should be worked out using nonessential personnel, as repeated use has shown signs of inducing chronic migraines, long after SCP-558-2 has been removed.

SCP-558-3 includes six (6) black contact lenses. Currently, only Class D personnel should be allowed to test SCP-558-3. When testing these lenses, approximately three (3) in five (5) subjects immediately lost consciousness. Those remaining conscious immediately shut their eyes and began to shake violently, demanding the contacts be removed. Several subjects harmed themselves and the lenses trying to remove them, resulting in the loss of four (4) lenses and a number of Class D personnel. When subjects were restrained and forced to open their eyes, all immediately degenerated into sobbing and incoherent babbling. Most subjects black out shortly after this point. To date two subjects have remained conscious and open-eyed with SCP-558-3 in their eyes. The first, Class D personnel D-75532-2, stared blankly straight ahead and seemed unresponsive to stimuli, even pain. She was observed to mutter continually, but no words were discerned. After the lenses were removed, D-75532-2 went into a catatonic state, in which she remains in the medical wing of Research Site-██. An interview with the second, Class D personnel D-34421-9, is appended as Document SCP-558-3G. It is theorized by Professor Skali █████████ and Dr. ██████, based on the interview, that the SCP-558-3 lenses somehow allow subjects to perceive time, often called the fourth dimension, in a visual way. It seems that the average psyche is not capable of handling the increased perspective and in most cases the mind turns inward, causing unconsciousness and memory loss consistent with dissociative amnesia. Experimentation is ongoing in an effort to further understand SCP-558-3, specifically if they enable the wearer to see points in time other than the present. Priority is given to testing involving possibilities of precognition.

**Addendum 558-3A:**
During routine evaluations, approximately three (3) in four (4) persons who had worn SCP-558-3 had exhibited signs of severe depression and anxiety. Moreover, one (1) in three (3) had incidents of self-mutilation, usually of the eyes, often accompanied by suicidal tendencies.
