**Item #:** SCP-2608

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** The health of all known SCP-2608 populations is to be monitored closely. Great care should be taken to prevent industrial sources from chemically damaging the environments these populations inhabit. 
SCP-2608 populations are to be kept at all suitable foundation facilities and monitored as a priority. In the event that these "Advance Warning Systems" (2608-AWS) experience a decline of any sort, the site manager is to be alerted immediately and precautionary measures are to be taken. Reevaluation of the active radii of various occult, psychoactive, and temporal SCP objects via SCP-2608 subimago testing is pending O5 approval.

As of 12/21/2014, a "doomsday cache" population is to be established at Site-62, and the Site-64 population has been expanded and repurposed to monitor unexplained global population fluctuation in SCP-2608.

**Description:** SCP-2608 is a largely unstudied mayfly species //(Stenonema nephilim)// native to the Pacific Northwest. It is thought to have spread across North America in just the last two decades.[[footnote]]Based on the vulnerability of SCP-2608 populations to certain phenomena, it has been suggested that this is due to Foundation activity, as the containment of such phenomena would allow SCP-2608 to colonize previously hostile environments. However, there is not currently definitive proof of this.[[/footnote]] 

SCP-2608 imagines[[footnote]]The sexually mature adult stage of an insect.[[/footnote]] can be distinguished from related species by their relatively larger eyes and relatively more translucent bodies—however, these differences are subtle enough that they cannot be readily identified by unqualified individuals. SCP-2608 subimagines[[footnote]]A winged, but not yet fully developed and not yet fully mature sub-adult stage unique to order Ephemeroptera.[[/footnote]] and SCP-2608 naiads[[footnote]]The aquatic juvenile stage of a mayfly.[[/footnote]] cannot be reliably distinguished from related species by any means outside of DNA examination.

SCP-2608 was first brought to foundation attention when the population experienced a then-inexplicably widespread die-off in the spring of 2005 now thought to be the result of the ten day delay in containment of [[[SCP-1425 |SCP-1425]]].[[footnote]]See [[[SCP-1425 |SCP-1425]]] documentation for details.[[/footnote]] The species has since been restored to its former range.

SCP-2608 populations—and, in some cases, individuals—are extremely vulnerable to psychoactive and occult phenomena and undergo sterilization, faulty molting and death when exposed. As populations are thus adversely affected and strong effects often cause them to die off completely, the presence of SCP-2608 in an area can be considered proof of safety and/or containment. For this reason, SCP-2608 populations have been cleared for use as an "advance warning system" (2608-AWS) and kept at select Foundation facilities, thereby providing an early warning in case of growth, strengthening, or resumed activity of anomalous phenomena at Foundation Provisional Sites and containment breach at Foundation Sites and Areas. 
Phenomena that are harmful to SCP-2608 are, for the most part, limited to those with some kind of radius of effect—that is, those that exert an "area of influence" of some kind on reality.[[footnote]]SCP-2608 populations are also vulnerable to objects with radioactive or chemical elements, but their (and other mayfly species') vulnerability to similiar non-anomalous phenomena suggests that this is not an anomalous property of SCP-2608.[[/footnote]]

These phenomena include but are not limited to:
* Psychoactive fields
* Telepathic fields
* Temporal distortion
* Spatial distortion
* Reality distortion
* Mere proximity to some SCP objects that do not possess an "area of influence." It has been theorized that in these cases it is some manner of "presence" (malevolent or otherwise) surrounding the object that SCP-2608 populations are sensitive to.

SCP-2608 subimagines are particularly at risk; in testing with select suitable SCP objects, individuals consistently perished when brought within the active radius of every object. Preliminary testing suggests that SCP-2608 subimago testing can be used to map the borders of SCP objects' "area of influence" to a startling degree of accuracy. 

Often, SCP-2608 naiads and subimagines will show signs of disturbance by an SCP object at much greater distances than human test subjects; in one noteworthy case, SCP-2608 naiads perished up to 800 km outside of what had previously been thought to be the object's area of influence.

**Addendum:** - 05/26/2009 - Travel capable 2608-AWS are available upon request for exploration and recovery missions. Contact Dr. Lymph or Site-64 administration for more details.

**Addendum:** - 12/21/2014 - All known wild SCP-2608 populations experienced a population decline 0.6% higher than expected over the course of the 2014 frost. In addition, all captive Foundation populations have experienced an unexplained 0.5% population decline. 2608-AWS warning allowances have been updated to compensate.

**Addendum:** - 4/10/2015 - With the exception of the Site-62 population,[[footnote]]The Site-62 population remains at full health.[[/footnote]] all SCP-2608 populations have declined a further 1.8%. 2608-AWS warning allowances have been updated to compensate.


**Addendum:** - 8/11/2015 - Global SCP-2608 population decline has continued to progress at a constant rate. 2608-AWS warning allowances have been updated to compensate and will continually update based on projected background disturbance.
