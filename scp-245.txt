|comments= Hello. This is an SCP that is only describable using interactive media. I utilized RPG Maker to create this, and there are 4 endings.

Spoilers on the discussion page.

I got lots of help and testing on this. Pretty sure I dinged all the testers in the credits, but special thanks to Decibelles, TwistedGears, and Waterfire. Additionally thank you to SunnyClockwork for the beautiful artwork I used in the game.

Note: My original SCP-245 was moved to the SCP-2623 slot with specific explicit permission from the administration given the nature of the project I put into the SCP-245 slot. It should not be taken as a precedent of any kind as to permission to do any such action in the future.

Also! If you play this and spot a bug, mention it here. I'll fix it as soon as possible. I've run through this myself a hundred times or more, but I'm sure I or my testers missed something.

And I've requested that the page be locked so no one can edit it and mess with the links. If you're wondering why it's locked.

Edit: Until I was halfway through making it, I was unaware that this wouldn't run on Macs (or even that Macs can't run EXEs). Despite that, I have been told by other users that a windows emulator can run this program no problem. Suggested emulators such as "Wine" and "Bootcamp" have been mentioned.
