//"Had a **great** idea recently. Can't look at SCP-9342-X without going insane, right? Well, he had the bright idea to take a video of it, then watch the video. That way, you aren't reading the actual stuff, just a recording of the stuff."//

//"That's quite a leap, even for him. How did he get approval?"//
