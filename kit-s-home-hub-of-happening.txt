title:Kit's Home Hub of Happenings
Kit deserves a pretty hub, but pretty hubs take time, so this is Under Construction.

Please excuse the dust, unexpected noises, and the occasional creation of swarms of butterflies.

You can read these in a-n-y order and they'll make the same amount of sense: none.

Because --Kit is not a person--

Because Kit cannot be easily explained in his actions and worlds.

I suggest you start at the top and work down. I suggest you wear a hard hat. I suggest you hold on tight to that hard hat and watch out for wrenches thrown by curious creatures with no hands and only tongues.
