> **Incident ████████████**
> 
> With approval from O5-█, Operation Kiddie Pool was authorized on ██/██/████ with the express purpose of containing SCP-2770 indefinitely. This operation was designed by Dr. ████ and Agent ████████, as they theorized that from observations made of SCP-2770-1, divorcing it from any notable source of water would both render SCP-2770-2 incapable of manifesting, and remove SCP-2770-1's ability to retreat back into the water.
> 
> The operation was divided into three parts:
> 
> # Gamma-6 would locate and then lift SCP-2770-1 from the water via a modified Mi-26 (operating name: "Lifeguard") equipped with a hooking device created specifically for the operation.
> # With SCP-2770-1 hooked, Lifeguard would then transport SCP-2770-1 to Site ██, a secure location in the hyper-arid ████████ Desert.
> # Once arrived, Gamma-6 personnel would take custody of SCP-2770-1, well isolated from any possible source of water.
> 
> On █/█/████, Operation Kiddie Pool commenced at ████ hours. At the time of the operation, SCP-2770-1 was being tracked off the coast of Iceland, and was intercepted by Lifeguard thirty minutes, twelve seconds after the commencement of the operation. SCP-2770-1 was attached to the hook without any difficulties and lifted out of the water with no appearance by SCP-2770-2.
> 
> Six hours, seventeen minutes later, Lifeguard arrived at Site ██, delivering SCP-2770-1 into its custody. SCP-2770-1 surrendered itself with no struggle, and SCP-2770-2 failed to manifest. Operation Kiddie Pool was deemed a success.
> 
> 
> 
> An interrogation was conducted one week later. SCP-2770-1 had not escaped custody with its previously recorded teleportation ability, and had been generally cooperative with staff at Site ██ to this point. Transcript of video will now follow:
> 
> [SCP-2770-1 is escorted into the room by two Gamma-6 personnel and sits down to a chair across from Agent ████████]
> 
> **Agent ████████:** Hello, SCP-2770-1.
> 
> **SCP-2770-1:** Hello, sir. Once again, I cannot tell you how grateful I am for the rescue with your crazy hoverin' plane. I've been stranded out there for...I don't know how long.
> 
> **Agent ████████:** We're always glad to help. So, SCP-2770-1, do you have a name?
> 
> **SCP-2770-1:** I do, sir. Lieutenant Edward Rowling, British Royal Navy.
> 
> **Agent ████████:**  I see. What year do you think this is? Your uniform is quite out of date.
> 
> **SCP-2770-1:** [rubs neck] I...don't rightly know. Truth be told, the months and years just started to meld together after a while. And apologies about my uniform, I'll admit it's seen better days.
> 
> **Agent ████████:** About your days melding together. What can you tell me about SCP-2770-2?
> 
> **SCP-2770-1:** Come again?
> 
> **Agent ████████:** The submarine. We have records of you being rescued by ships, only for them to be attacked by a submersible vessel in an extreme state of neglect.
> 
> **SCP-2770-1:** Oh. //That thing.//
> 
> [SCP-2770-1 leans in]
> 
> **SCP-2770-1:** Well, my ship were transporting some Yanks to Europe around February to smack up the Kaiser when a bloody U-Boat came out of nowhere and ambushed us. We had two torpedoes hit in the hull before we even knew what was going on.
> 
> **Agent ████████:** Yes?
> 
> **SCP-2770-1:** The captain knew the ship was going down either way, so he gave the order to ram the sub. [XXX-1 chuckles] Took those bastards down with us. The ship really started to sink after we hit the sub, and I was one of the last off. Had a raft all to myself and everything.
> 
> **Agent ████████:** How does this tie into your relationship with SCP-2770-2?
> 
> **SCP-2770-1:** I was adrift probably...three days? Then one morning I'm just watching the seagulls flying circles around my raft when something pulled me under, raft and all.
> 
> **Agent ████████:** SCP-2770-2?
> 
> **SCP-2770-1:** If that's what you want to call it. I remember being underwater, seeing that hatch open...and then feeling cold, and dark. And wet. And...
> 
> **Agent ████████:** I know it's hard, but you're safe from that thing now. Please tell me whatever you know about it.
> 
> **SCP-2770-1:** I don't think it was the same sub that sunk my ship. It was...something else. It would let me go and I'd show up in all over the damn place. Every time I'd try to get help, but that thing would just show back up and take back.
> 
> **Agent ████████:** Do you remember your times inside SCP-2770-2?
> 
> **SCP-2770-1:** Pieces. Like I said, it was cold, dark, and wet. And I'd hear those voices. And those eyes. Like a dead fish. The eyes would talk to me, whisper to me. Told me that if I didn't bring it a big ship, it would get me next. 
> 
> [12 seconds of silence between SCP-2770-1 and Agent ████████.]
> 
> **SCP-2770-1:** I'm not feeling so well. When did you guys say I could leave this place?
> 
> **Agent ████████:** You'll be here for an indefinite amount of time, I'm afraid.
> 
> **SCP-2770-1:** Yeah, okay. At least this place beats getting chased by the fucking sub.
> 
> **Agent ████████:** One more thing, Lt. Church. 
> 
> [Agent ████████ leans under the desk to retrieve something. He comes up a moment later and throws a portfolio on the desk.]
> 
> **SCP-2770-1:** What's this?
> 
> **Agent ████████:** A lot of things. Naval records, High Seas Fleet logistic logs, WW1-era insurance claims. I wasn't going to talk to you without doing my homework first.
> 
> **SCP-2770-1:** I don't follow.
> 
> **Agent ████████:** There is no Edward Rowling matching your description in any Royal Naval records. There was no U-Boat scheduled to patrol that area of the ocean at the time you claim, and the ship you abandoned never existed. The company that makes that life raft that you love to float in so much wasn't even founded until 1961. By all accounts, you're lying to me.
> 
> **SCP-2770-1:** Wait a minute, I—
> 
> **Agent ████████:** G6-██ and G6-██, please escort SCP-2770-1 back to his cell. He'll be our guest for quite some time. 
> 
> **SCP-2770-1:** Typical. 
> 
> [G6-██ and G6-██ begin to escort SCP-2770-1 out of the room]
> 
> **SCP-2770-1:** Doesn't really matter now. I'll give you credit, you picked a pretty damn good hiding place. Had to learn a few new tricks just to get here. But I think I'll be going now.
> 
> 
> **Agent ████████:** Going? You're in the middle of a goddamn desert. 
> 
> **SCP-2770-1:** You forgot about the water table, you fucking idiot.
> 
> [What appears to be a conning tower of SCP-2770-2 erupts in the middle of the interrogation room. The hatch on the top opens, followed by a total loss of communication with Site ██.]
> 
> **END TRANSCRIPT**

> MTF dispatched to Site ██ finds the facility missing. Orbital assets confirm that at the time of communication loss, Site ██ was pulled in its entirety under the sand. Recovery teams present detect no traces of Site ██ with subterranean imaging, and all staff are presumed KIA.
> 
> After this event, SCP-2770-1 did not appear for another █ years.
> 
> Foundation secure site protocols now in full review. 
> 
> SCP-2770 reclassification to Keter pending.
> 
> **END INCIDENT REPORT**
