**Description:** SCP-2589 was an entity that was confined to a mobile home in Warsaw, Indiana. The entity had limited mobility, lacking limbs. Its body was bell-shaped, consisting of a large mouth in the torso, and an elongated, upward-facing head on which there was a Warsaw Police Department branded trucker cap. The entity's body was white with red splotches, having the appearance of bruises. SCP-2589's body did not appear to have an internal structure, the skin simply forming a floating membrane in the shape of itself. 

The entity was capable of manipulating the physical reality of the area around it. SCP-2589 utilized this ability to create "mouth traps" in areas which lead to its stomach. These spaces manifested as spaces in walls, enclosures of any kind such as a doghouse, closets, and in one case a pair of pants. These portals have a tendency to manifest most commonly in holes. Subjects affected by SCP-2589 claimed they most commonly fell into the trap when walking through the master bedroom of the home.

The entity would "eat" humans or animals if it was fed. SCP-2589 did not seem to be sapient, and did not actively attempt to consume subjects with its person. SCP-2589 only physically consumed an individual if it was assisted. 

The effects of this consumption were varied. Affected subjects would reappear later, albeit with mild or moderate changes to their appearance. Their behavior was not unusual, and they retained memories of being fed to SCP-2589. Subjects frequently responded to this event with frustration or misdirection. A woman subjected to SCP-2589 prior to its containment was digested roughly 100 times. When questioned, Emma Clark (23) seemed frustrated, to quote, “I don’t see what the problem is.”

When SCP-2589 inhabited the home, the people living in that home expressed dismissal or disinterest in SCP-2589. Adolescents, however, did not seem to be affected by the anomaly and would respond to SCP-2589 as one would typically expect. The home where SCP-2589 was found, when investigated, revealed that the surviving children growing up around SCP-2589 were conditioned to accept it from a young age.

**Addendum A:** Selected excerpts from video footage located in the home. Dates could not be found on the tapes, they are arranged in order of occurrence. The home was outfitted with 12 security cameras. Local police had questioned the father, Jacob Clark,  about the cameras at one point prior to SCP-2589’s neutralization, to which the father responded “He liked knowing what went on in his home."

The family affected by SCP-2589 were Emma Clark (23), her husband, Jacob Clark (47), Jacob Clark's brother, Ethan Young (32), the Clark's mother, Madison Clark (67), and two children, Andrew (8), Ezekiel (11), and their dog [Destroyer] (2).

> Andrew moves down the hallway. Heavy breathing is audible on the tape, as well as a barely audible loop of Bee Gees //Night Fever//. The wall next to Andrew begins heaving as if it were organic. A small section of the wall collapses, revealing a deformed Ezekiel. Ezekiel's body appears to have been compressed into a cube. Andrew observes the hole, motionless.

> Andrew continues staring at the hole.

**Addendum B:** Local police had been called to the location ten times previously on the grounds of domestic disturbances. On 03/12/██ Deputy Alexis Walker received a private phone call from Andrew urging her to go to the location of the home. Alexis had given Andrew her phone number on a previous visit. Alexis arrived at the location, entering the home without provocation, and discovered Jacob Clark in the act of assaulting Ethan Young.

> Alexis is seen leaving the area with Andrew and Ezekiel. She is followed by Ethan and Madison out of the house. The two shout at Alexis while the vehicle drives away.

Alexis, Andrew, or Ezekiel could not be located afterward. Records have been scrubbed from local law enforcement agencies and kept on the Foundation's private record in line with current disinformation protocol. No anomalous activity has been detected in the house to date.
