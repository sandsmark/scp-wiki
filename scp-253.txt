**Item #:** SCP-253

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** At this time, SCP-253 poses a substantial threat to humanity. SCP-253 is to be kept under Biosafety Level-4 protocols at all times. All research is to be conducted at a site where incineration and irradiation protocols can be swiftly enacted, that is geographically isolated, and does not possess a diverse biosphere. The sterilization protocols shall be enacted following the occurrence of any event on this list:

* Communications blackout lasting longer then forty-eight (48) hours.
* Power disruption lasting longer then one (1) minute during any active experiments involving SCP-253.
* Abnormal rise in average temperatures beyond 10 degrees Fahrenheit or humidity levels to 90% relative humidity.
* Manifestations of unusual electromagnetic phenomena during testing of SCP-253.

At the conclusion of testing, any subjects exposed to SCP-253 are to be disposed of, and their remains are subject to the sterilization protocol.

Any researcher leaving the facility is to undergo two weeks of mandatory chemotherapy followed by a 15-day quarantine.

**Description:** SCP-253 is a cluster of undifferentiated human cells, matching the physiological traits of cancer. As per cancerous cells, cultured samples of SCP-253 will grow indefinitely if given an adequate source of nutrition. SCP-253 is contagious, able to pass from human to human, as well as to some animal species. The SCP is not airborn, but physical contact with surface neoplasms on infected subjects will spread the plague.

The first signs of SCP-253 infection is the emergence of skin lesions, typically dime sized (2 cm) in groups of three to five, at the site of infection. Within twelve (12) hours after the appearance of the lesions, MRI scans show the development of neoplasms within the brain. At this time, the neoplasms do not induce neurological symptoms.

Over the period of twenty-four to forty-eight (24 to 48) hours, numerous skin lesions start to emerge and grow in size. These lesions often induce substantial swelling in surrounding tissue, which can be quite painful for the subject. Often the pain if left untreated leaves many subjects unable to move. Towards the end of the
forty-eight (48) hour period, neoplasms start to emerge in lymphatic system and neurological symptoms start to manifest.

The neurological symptoms of SCP-253 are different for each patient depending on which part of the brain the invasive cells have contaminated, with one exception. Each human patient heretofore exposed to SCP-253 has felt a complete cessation of pain forty-seven to forty-nine (47 to 49) hours after infection. Other neurological symptoms include the following:

* Inability to focus attention
* Disorganized speech
* Memory-loss
* Hallucinations
* Euphoria
* Megalomania
* Inappropriate emotional responses
* Sociopathy
* Catatonia

If the weight of cancerous cells within a population does not reach a biomass threshold of approximately one-thousand four-hundred kilograms (1400 kg/3085 lbs) the cells will overwhelm the host within five (5) days, resulting in death. If not transferred to a new host, the cancer cells will consume any remaining usable biomass of the host's corpse before finally running out of resources and dying.

However, further experimentation has shown that if the number of cancer cells within a population reaches the threshold, electromagnetic phenomena will start to manifest. The source of these phenomena appear to be the infected hosts, but the mechanism of the EM manipulation is not understood at this time.

Further, it appears the EM emanations facilitate some sort of communication between the hosts. Coordinated in some fashion by the neoplasms, the hosts start to act as one entity spread through many bodies. The intelligence of this entity is initially animalistic and reactive. As the intelligence of the gestalt entity is believed to be based on the remaining brain tissue within the hosts it is hypothesized that the entity may be able to achieve human-like intelligence. It has been suggested that Incident I.J77.82 supports this hypothesis, and that some of the more unsettling things seen at ██████████████ Hospital are manifestations of this intellect.

Until suitable methods can be created to jam the EM transmissions of the end-stage infection entity, and until efficacious treatment alternatives for the diseases known as cancer enters common usage, this entity is categorized as Keter.

**Addendum 253a:** Proposal that SCP-253 is to be classified as Euclid is pending review of Incident I.J77.82 by the Overseers.
