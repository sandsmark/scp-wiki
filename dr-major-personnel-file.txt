**Profile:** Hi. I joined this site in the early days of 2009 and wrote a few articles, but went inactive for a couple of years, due to changing RL circumstances and running out of ideas. 

I came back a few years later and wrote a few more articles, but went inactive for a couple of years, due to... well, you can guess. 

A few months ago I had a look at some of the newer articles and got hooked again seeing the different themes and writing styles the site has gone through, and wrote some more stuff. Maybe I'll try to write for longer this time, but if not, based on my previous history you can expect a new batch of articles in 2020.

My education/work background is in medical science and the health industry. I enjoy history, sci-fi, PC games, travelling and long walks on the beach.
