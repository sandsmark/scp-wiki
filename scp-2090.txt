**Item #:** SCP-2090

**Object Class:** --Euclid-- Neutralized

**Special Containment Procedures:** Foundation personnel standing in as personal security staff are to closely monitor SCP-2090 on a day-to-day basis for any sign of anomalous deviation. Kant Counters are to be discreetly installed in and around the home of SCP-2090 to provide constant surveillance of SCP-2090 and any disturbances caused by its anomalous nature. Any discrepancies are to be reported to Level 2090/4 staff personnel assigned to SCP-2090, or to the MTF P-5 team leader.

Under no circumstances should Foundation Protocol Ōllamaliztli-5 be interrupted. Due to the current state of Protocol Ōllamaliztli-5 and its influence on American and global culture, interruptions are not expected.

**FILESERV NOTICE:** THE FOLLOWING IS THE SCP-2090 DATA FILE AS IT APPEARED BEFORE ITS RECLASSIFICATION AS NEUTRALIZED. SOME ERRORS MAY PERSIST.

**Description:** SCP-2090 is a Class I humanoid entity that goes by the name of Tim Duncan, and is currently the starting power forward/center for the San Antonio Spurs professional basketball team. SCP-2090 exhibits no visibly noticeable anomalous properties, and its nature is only detectable by use of Kant Reality Counters used to identify disturbances in local reality. SCP-2090 displays a remarkably high Hume discrepancy, although this effect is seemingly limited to its body and has no effect on the world around it. Despite this, due to information gathered via Protocol Ōllamaliztli-5, SCP-2090 must be constantly monitored for any sign of changes in behaviour or anomalous activity. 

**Discovery:** SCP-2090 was initially discovered during routine inspection of Area of Interest CA-74 "Sleep Train Arena" in Sacramento, California, during a game between the San Antonio Spurs and the Sacramento Kings. What was initially thought to be an equipment malfunction was later discovered to be caused by massive interference created by SCP-2090. Due to the high level of celebrity that SCP-2090 has obtained, it was considered unfeasible to remove the subject from the public and place it within containment for further observation. This resulted in the creation of Mobile Task Force Rho-5 "Spurs and Saddles", which constantly monitors SCP-2090 and ensures proper application of Protocol Ōllamaliztli-5. 

**Addendum 2090.1:** Protocol Ōllamaliztli-5 [Information Restricted to Level 2090/4 and MTF P-5 Personnel Only]

//During initial observation of SCP-2090, Foundation IT personnel began to discover a number of encrypted files within the Foundation database. Foundation Internal Intelligence teams were set with gaining access to these files, and discovering their origin. With help from the SCP-2090 research team and MTF P-5, the code-breaking effort was a success. Notably, all files were dated at various points within two years after the date of discovery, although additional information suggests that they had existed within the Foundation database for an extensive period of time. While many of the files were incomplete and missing data, enough was recovered to properly deduce and implement Protocol Ōllamaliztli-5.//

**Addendum 2090.2:** Cessation of Abnormal Hume Activity

On July 11th, 2016, SCP-2090 announced its retirement from the National Basketball Association after 19 seasons with the San Antonio Spurs. While containment personnel were on hand during the announcement of the subject's retirement in the event of a prospective breach of containment, no such anomalous activity took place. Hume readings of the subject shortly thereafter showed that the individual known as Tim Duncan no longer expressed abnormal Hume levels, and as such should no longer be considered anomalous. After a period of sustained observation with no notable activity in that time, SCP-2090 was reclassified as NEUTRALIZED.

However, since Tim Duncan's retirement and subsequent reclassification, several other professional basketball players have also expressed unusual Kant Counter readings, similar to those previously expressed by SCP-2090. Until more information can be collected, the following individuals are to be considered Persons of Interest:

* **POI #57284** - Karl-Anthony Towns - //Concern: Low//
* **POI #57285** - Joel Embiid - //Concern: Low//
* **POI #57286** - Giannis Antetokuonmpo - //Concern: Moderate//
* **POI #57287** - Anthony Davis - //Concern: High//
* **POI #57288** - Victor Oladipo - //Concern: Very High//

Further investigation is ongoing.
