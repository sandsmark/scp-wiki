**Which thing:** --Thing-I-- Thing-I-U

**How bad thing:** --Not Bad-- Understood

**How keep thing:** --At least one of Thing-I must keep in hole in ground in Cave-IIII--. At least one Witch Doctor must be awake near a hole with Thing-I kept in.  Must throw wood, leaf, bone to Thing-I to eat, or it die. When not in hole in ground, Thing-I worse than mountain lion, Very Bad. Thing-I don't hurt by spear, axe or fist. To stop use water, piss, throw ground or beat with tree branch. 
Trying things on Thing-I only for Witch Doctor with wolf pelt or higher, need to tell Witch Doctor U██ before try.
//No piss at Thing-I unless very short. -Shaman A██//

//If need Thing-I, Witch Doctor O█ can teach how to Witch Doctor with wolf pelt or higher. No write how make Thing-I , no tell how make Thing-I to man of no wolf pelt or you sent to Very Bad duty.//

**What thing is:** Thing-I hot, bright thing, yellow color. Thing-I no grab by hand, but can move when put wood with Thing-I on it into animal skull.  Trying show above Thing-I hot like in Thing-I, but no bright.  Thing-I happen when wood, leaf, bone, pelt, fat touch Thing-I that already somewhere. Thing-I also happen when Thing-III hit a tree, or wood touch near Thing-IIII.
Water, piss, earth, slap with branch all kill Thing-I. But, Thing-I  man must watch over - work of  Witch Doctor K███  show Thing-I is what make Happening-I happen.
Thing-I very useful to the Gathering - see Things Tried on Thing-I.
