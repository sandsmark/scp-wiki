++++ __**Special Containment Procedures:**__ 
SCP-5071-1 through SCP-5071-5 are currently being housed in a series of specially modified cryogenic containment chambers at Site-122 in order to prevent further decomposition. 

Research into the processes by which the SCP-5071 instances were created is ongoing, though researchers have been advised to interact directly with the SCP-5071 instances as infrequently as possible.

SCP-5071-A is being held in Standard Anomalous Containment Locker 16 in the inert object storage wing of Site-122.

PoI-5071 remains at large as of 2020/06/13. Any information regarding the possible whereabouts of PoI-5071 should be immediately forwarded to Dr. Elizabeth Carver in the Anomalous Post-Mortem Pathology Department, or the current HMCL Supervisor. 

++++ __**Description:**__
SCP-5071 is the amalgamate designation for a collection of five cadavers (designated SCP-5071-1 through SCP-5071-5) discovered within an abandoned barn near Bramford, Ipswich. SCP-5071 instances have been mutilated in a variety of ways via anomalous means. It has been determined that these mutilations occurred post-mortem, and that each of the cadavers died resulted from violent, non-anomalous means. 

The barn itself looked to have been lived in for several years, and was decorated as though it had seen use in the past as a combined artist's studio / living space. The front of the barn had been partially renovated to include a small cooking area, sleeping space, and seating area. The remainder of the space had been cleared and sectioned into work stations, each equipped with a variety of both mundane and anomalous supplies and tools. The SCP-5071 cadavers were found throughout the space as follows:

[[div class="blockquote"]]
__**SCP-5071-1**__
**Name:** Cody Stanford (33, M)
**Alterations:**
* Limbs and digits have been wrapped in lengths of pale cloth resembling bandages commonly found in WWI-era field hospitals. A brilliant green organic crust has formed within the vast majority of these bandages, making removal impossible without significant damage to the SCP-5071-1 instance. 
* SCP-5071-1 has been decapitated, and the remains of its neck has been neatly wrapped in the same lengths of cloth. These bandages also show extensive contamination by the virulent green crust.
* SCP-5071-1’s head has been placed in its lap, where it is held erect by the subject's bandaged hands. 
* Eyes open[[footnote]]The eyes have been noted to blink intermittently, with occurrences happening 287 to 923 seconds apart.[[/footnote]], lips curved in a slight smile.
[[/div]]
SCP-5071-1 was located in the small seating area to the right of the entrance to the barn, seated in a high-backed leather chair. On the side table next to it were several unrolled lengths of bandage, including the remnants what looks like a thaumaturgic "first aid kit" spread across it and the floor. 

A crumpled piece of parchment was found underneath the chair. The paper was covered with substantial notations in two different hands, all of which had been crossed out and written over so extensively as to be no longer legible.

__**SCP-5071-2**__
**Name:** Maryha Magee (36, F)
**Alterations:**
* All dermal layers are now "hot pink".
* Multiple lacerations of varying depths and patterns, several of which appear to have thaumaturgical significance.
* Visible bodily effluvia are black in color, and retain a relative viscosity significantly higher than baseline human effluvium. 
* Despite the large amount of fluid noted to be oozing from the lacerations, SCP-5071-1 shows no physical signs of blood loss.
* The ocular organs have been removed, and an unknown black ichor weeps continuously from the remnant cavities.  
[[/div]]

SCP-5071-1 was found several meters further into the barn, standing upright against the wall with its hands clasped to its chest. Surrounding the instance were several glass jars containing remnants of a powdered paint as well as over a dozen open packets of craft glitter. A piece of parchment was found nailed to the wall beside the cadaver.

++++ __**Addendum:**__ 

Additional discovery into the identities of SCP-5071-1 through SCP-5071-5 positively identified them as the corpses of five persons of interest that were the subjects of a Foundation raid on a [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/are-we-cool-yet-hub GoI-0267 ("Are We Cool Yet?")] safehouse.

In November, 2018, Foundation sources uncovered the possible existence of extra band members belonging to the anomalous punk band [[[SCP-4764 | PEOPLES CHOICE]]]. The members' last known location was an abandoned farm house in Bramford, Ipswich that had been investigated after the SCP-4764 incident as a possible AWCY? safehouse. 

MTF Delta-5 ("Front Runners") were deployed to recover the members by any means necessary. Due to the known hostility and threat posed by PEOPLES CHOICE, Delta-5 executed the raid with the authorization to utilize lethal force if the members did not cooperate.

When Delta-5 arrived, the members were preforming a song by PEOPLES CHOICE. Despite repeated demands by the Delta-5 squad leader to cease the performance, the targets refused and the Delta-5 squad was forced to engage. 

At this time an unknown sixth party, designated PoI-5071, intervened and the combined group was able to hold off Delta-5 for over three hours, with PoI-5071 utilizing an extensive array of thaumaturgic incantations in the conflict.

Despite the intervention of PoI-5071, all five targets were successfully eliminated, and PoI-5071 was forced to flee after sustaining multiple and severe injuries.

The cadavers of the targets were turned over to the local authorities for processing and burial under the cover story Gamma Two ("Industrial Accident"). Shortly afterwards, several corpses were reported missing from the Mid Suffolk administrative district morgue. It is now suspected that PoI-5071 is responsible for this, and the transportation of the cadavers to the location of discovery.

Several days after SCP-5071 was placed in containment, Site-122 received the following letter addressed to all five members.
