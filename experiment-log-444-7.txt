title:Experiment Log 444-7
**Experiment 444-7 Log**

**Chief researchers:** Mr J Mellows, linguistics expert.  Dr ████, sociology expert.  ██████, military assessor.

**Experimental Perimeters:** It has been suggested that psychological deviations may occur as a result of long term infection with SCP-444 due to limitation of vocabulary.  50 Category D personnel with violent backgrounds were exposed to SCP-444 and placed in a sealed environment with limited but sufficient resources.  They are to be informed that they are not to be released at any point and their environment will not be interfered with by the Foundation.  A control group of 50 Category D personnel will also be maintained.  Monthly terminations are suspended in both groups.

**Date: ██-██-19██**

[Control group:  Group introduced to environment.  By the end of week 2, population stands at 42.]
[Test group: Group introduced to environment.  By the end of week 2, population stands at 47.]

**Date: ██-██-19██**

[Control group:  Wide-scale violence and gang culture has developed.  By end of month 1, population stands at 26 with several subjects suffering from malnutrition.]
[Test group: Group has entered stable group dynamic behind 4 dominant personalties.  By end of month 1, population stands at 42.]

**Date: ██-██-19██**

[Control group:  Violence escalated significantly.  By end of month 6, population stands at 7.  Group terminated as non-viable.]
[Test group: Group authority has dissolved, organisation is functioning as an ideal anarchic commune.  By end of month 1, population stands at 42 with several pregnancies.]

**Date: ██-██-19██**

[Control group:  Extinct.]
[Test group: 1 year after experiment commenced population stands at 52.  1 additional, unexposed, category D personnel introduced.  Group rapidly accepts introduced personnel as leader, showing no resistance to subjugation.  Group terminated and youths placed in custody to establish development in infants.]

**Date:  ██-██-19██**

[Infant group: Progressive development confirmed, group terminated.]

**Notes:** [Potential cure is still being examined.  Behaviour of subjected individuals would be valuable in category D personnel if spread can be contained.  Value of SCP-444 as a potential invasion tool confirmed.]
