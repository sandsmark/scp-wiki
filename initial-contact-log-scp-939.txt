Trapper was deployed to the outskirts of ██████████, ██████████ on 10/28/1981, following the disappearance of a Foundation field agent. The agent was investigating a number of localized missing persons cases, as well the loss of contact with several law enforcement officers dispatched to investigate these cases, in the area.
