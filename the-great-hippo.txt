**[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3034 The Counting Station] [[[[SCP-3034]]]]**
 //...a reoccurring anomalous radio broadcast of unknown origin...//
[[collapsible show=" ► Commentary" hide=" ▼ Close File"]]
The first SCP I wrote (and one of the easiest to finish). There's just something sinister about [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numbers_station number stations]. The sound sample was taken from an actual recording of one, slowed down and tweaked. Regrettably, I couldn't find a sound-file of a little Russian girl counting downwards (not one in the public domain, at least).

I'd like to actually revisit this some day.  I've learned a lot since writing it, and I suspect it's no where near as strong (or subtle) as it could be.

**[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3035 Science Bugs] [[[[SCP-3035]]]]**
 //...a strain of Periplaneta americana (American cockroach, or water-bug) that mimics the behavior and outward appearance of organisms...//
[[collapsible show=" ► Commentary" hide=" ▼ Close File"]]
Inspired by Guillermo del Toro's 1997 sci-fi horror film, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimic_(film) Mimic] -- with Richard Feynman's concept of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_science cargo cult science] thrown in. I find something fundamentally terrifying about the idea of imperfect [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_zombie p-zombies]; entities that try to mimic human behavior without actually possessing properties such as intelligence or sapience.

The final twist was a result of me imagining one of these things typing at a keyboard -- and then trying to think of how and why that would happen.

**[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3041 The Red Knife] [[[[SCP-3041]]]]**
 //...a 12 centimeter iron knife...//
[[collapsible show=" ► Commentary" hide=" ▼ Close File"]]
Inspired by one of Stephen King's short stories, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strawberry_Spring Strawberry Spring]. I started writing this before reading the excellent [http://www.scp-wiki.net/antimemetics-division-hub There Is No Antimemetic Division] series -- so I actually thought the twist was pretty novel. I still like it enough for what it is, though.

**[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3054 Cragstaff Sanitarium] [[[[SCP-3054]]]]**
 //...an anomalous phenomenon which affects patients interred in mental health facilities...//
[[collapsible show=" ► Commentary" hide=" ▼ Close File"]]
Inspired by actual experiences I've had with mental health clinics in America (as an outsider, not as an insider). Out of all my pieces, this is the one I'm most proud of (and have the most messed up feelings over).

**[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3045 bzzip.exe] [[[[SCP-3045]]]]**
 //...an anomalous application ('bzzip.exe') that reduces the size of certain types of media...//
[[collapsible show=" ► Commentary" hide=" ▼ Close File"]]
I wrote this to **1)** make fun of //Hamlet//, **2)** use the pun 'I/O-SAURON', **3)** make fun of //Waiting for Godot//, and **4)** write about a company that's '//Google, but with bees//'. As of writing this, it's my highest rated article, and also probably the one I least expected to be my highest rated article (isn't that the way it always goes?).

Also, I know this might be hard to believe, but: I really didn't know much about [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bee_Movie Bee Movie] before I started writing this article. I mean, I knew it existed -- but I didn't know anything about it. I just needed a final movie to end the skip with, so I typed 'bee movies' in youtube, and... my GOD. It was like finding the final piece of a puzzle in //a completely different puzzle set//. Then you finish the puzzle and discover it's not a puzzle at all, it's //**Jerry Seinfeld as an anthropomorphic bee**//.

The name 'HiveFind' was something [[*user Pedantique]] came up with.

**[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3043 Murphy Law in... Type 3043 - FOR MURDER!] [[[[SCP-3043]]]]**
 //...a 1937 Olympia Elite typewriter...//
[[collapsible show=" ► Commentary" hide=" ▼ Close File"]]
This one was inspired by a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mage:_The_Ascension Mage: The Ascension] campaign where a Marauder (think reality warper but lost in a delusion) was convinced he was in a 30s noir movie. The idea started as an unfinished noir movie script that was rewriting reality -- with the Foundation having to play along as characters in the script to contain it (and help it find an appropriate ending). Then it occurred to me that it might be way cooler if the script was the hero, with the anomaly as the villain. 

**Sidenote:** My initial draft was much less compelling, and relied on the pure novelty of the idea (a hard-boiled detective showing up to save the day and rewriting the article into a noir screenplay) -- but both [[*user shaggydredlocks]] and [[*user communism-will-win]] pushed at me to rewrite it into an actual mystery rather than just a 'Murphy Law' fanfic. The end result is far better than its previous iteration. So, learning lesson for me: Don't be lazy. Novelty is neat, but using novelty to tell a compelling story is better.

Oh, yeah, and [[*user Decibelles]] deserves the credit for the final [REDACTED] attachment (though I deserve all the //blame// for the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinatown_(1974_film) Chinatown] joke and the [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-423 Fred] reference).

**[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3057 Fossil Fuels] [[[[SCP-3057]]]]**
 //...an anomalous phenomenon by which crude oil spontaneously transforms into instances of prehistoric species...//
[[collapsible show=" ► Commentary" hide=" ▼ Close File"]]
I really love a lot of the ideas in this one, but it's one of my lowest rated articles for what's probably a  pretty good reason -- the interview sucks. I need to rewrite it.  

I still like the fact that I was actually able to find a case where the [http://www.scp-wiki.net/manna-charitable-foundation-hub Manna Charitable Foundation] might actually be pretty reasonable (in not wanting anything to do with this guy). Also, this article contains my favorite self-authored footnote: //Before being amnesticized, witnesses provided confirmation that instances of SCP-3057-4 did, in fact, have feathers.// Because you know the Foundation would take note of that.

Also, you can thank [[*user weryllium]] for MTF Psi-2 ("Clever Girls").

**[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2639 Video Game Violence] [[[[SCP-2639]]]]**
 //...a heavily modified online Quake death-match...//
[[collapsible show=" ► Commentary" hide=" ▼ Close File"]]
This is another one inspired by a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mage:_The_Ascension Mage: The Ascension] campaign (specifically, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mage:_The_Ascension#Council_of_Nine_Mystic_Traditions Virtual Adepts]). I'm very happy with this piece -- it's not a novel idea (//kids trapped in a video game don't realize **THE GAME IS REAL**//), but I still think it manages to succeed via using a cliche to tell a novel and (hopefully) interesting story. Some have told me the story is a bit too silly and uplifting, but I can't always do dark. I start feeling fetishistic and gross if I don't let my characters sometimes achieve at least a //little// victory.

MTF Omega-9 ("The Scrubs") were previously called "Griefer Madness" (thanks to [[*user shaggydredlocks]]), which is a name I still love -- but it was pointed out that "Griefer" was a modern term. I also really like the simplicity behind 'the Scrubs'.

**[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-437 Summer of '91] [[[[SCP-437]]]]**
 //...a large grove of trees located in Camp Lakewood...//
[[collapsible show=" ► Commentary" hide=" ▼ Close File"]]
As of writing this, it's my lowest rated story. I haven't deleted it mostly because I //really like it//, and I'm hoping maybe over time it will catch on. I dunno -- sometimes I'm really surprised by what works and what doesn't.

Anyway, the idea was inspired by [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_061_LBonG8 this] song, [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1833 SCP-1833], my anxieties as a teenager -- and all the creepy camp-ground stories you might tell your friends around a fire.

 //Right away, Rebecca could tell that the wand was high-end... Probably a semi-automagic.//
[[collapsible show=" ► Commentary" hide=" ▼ Close File"]]
I have no idea where this is supposed to go. I just really liked the idea of a universe where the Foundation is 'reversed'; containing science rather than 'miracles'.

**[http://www.scp-wiki.net/hartliss-detective-agency Hartliss Detective Agency]**
 //Y'know, basic Sarkic stuff.//
[[collapsible show=" ► Commentary" hide=" ▼ Close File"]]
My first attempt at a multi-part story. This opening took a while to get right -- I'm super-happy with it. It's basically a fusion between my love of 30s-era pulp-style magazines (with their excessive over-the-top gore) with a noir polish and a coating of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dresden_Files The Dresden Files] (which I've admittedly never read).

...and now looking at that wikipedia article, I see right away it contains a reference to the term 'semi-automagic', which I thought was kind of novel on my part. //Oh well//.

Anyway, one of the things I wanted to do with this is explore Sarkic themes in the context of a 1930s pulp-style story.

 //I'm about to drown in a sea of sugary mush and she's Baba Yaga. Pissing her off feels like the right move.//
[[collapsible show=" ► Commentary" hide=" ▼ Close File"]]
The second part of the Hartliss series. I'm less happy with this one; it was kind of an experimental thing I was trying out, when I should have probably gone with something more concrete. Still, I don't think it's //bad//... just a little artsy fartsy, especially considering the subject matter (hardboiled Sarkic detective investigating mysteries). Hopefully, the next (and final) piece will bring it back home with some straight-up two-fisted //justice//.
