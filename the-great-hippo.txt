The first SCP I wrote (and one of the easiest to finish). There's just something sinister about [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numbers_station number stations]. The sound sample was taken from an actual recording of one, slowed down and tweaked. Regrettably, I couldn't find a sound-file of a little Russian girl counting downwards (not one in the public domain, at least).

I'd like to actually revisit this some day.  I've learned a lot since writing it, and I suspect it's no where near as strong (or subtle) as it could be.

Inspired by Guillermo del Toro's 1997 sci-fi horror film, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimic_(film) Mimic] -- with Richard Feynman's concept of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_science cargo cult science] thrown in. I find something fundamentally terrifying about the idea of imperfect [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_zombie p-zombies]; entities that try to mimic human behavior without actually possessing properties such as intelligence or sapience.

The final twist was a result of me imagining one of these things typing at a keyboard -- and then trying to think of how and why that would happen.

Inspired by one of Stephen King's short stories, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strawberry_Spring Strawberry Spring]. I started writing this before reading the excellent [http://www.scp-wiki.net/antimemetics-division-hub There Is No Antimemetic Division] series -- so I actually thought the twist was pretty novel. I still like it enough for what it is, though.

Regrettably, I think it's a little unclear -- people have told me they think it has a retro-causal effect (it doesn't; its effect is purely memetic). Might one day revisit it to make this more clear.

Inspired by actual experiences I've had with mental health clinics in America (as an outsider, not as an insider). Out of all my pieces, this is the one I'm most proud of (and have the most messed up feelings over).

Outside of the personal stuff, one of the reasons I'm so proud of this piece is because it evokes horror without relying on violence, (physical) torture, or the threat of death. It just gaslights the shit out of you.

I wrote this to **1)** make fun of //Hamlet//, **2)** use the pun 'I/O-SAURON', **3)** make fun of //Waiting for Godot//, and **4)** write about a company that's '//Google, but with bees//'. As of writing this, it's my highest rated article, and also probably the one I least expected to be my highest rated article (isn't that the way it always goes?).

Also, I know this might be hard to believe, but: I really didn't know much about [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bee_Movie Bee Movie] before I started writing this article. I mean, I knew it existed -- but I didn't know anything about it. I just needed a final movie to end the skip with, so I typed 'bee movies' in youtube, and... my GOD. It was like finding the final piece of a puzzle in //a completely different puzzle set//. Then you finish the puzzle and discover it's not a puzzle at all, it's //**Jerry Seinfeld as an anthropomorphic bee**//.

The name 'HiveFind' was something [[*user Pedantique]] came up with.

This one was inspired by a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mage:_The_Ascension Mage: The Ascension] campaign where a Marauder (think reality warper but lost in a delusion) was convinced he was in a 30s noir movie. The idea started as an unfinished noir movie script that was rewriting reality -- with the Foundation having to play along as characters in the script to contain it (and help it find an appropriate ending). Then it occurred to me that it might be way cooler if the script was the hero, with the anomaly as the villain. 

**Sidenote:** My initial draft was much less compelling, and relied on the pure novelty of the idea (a hard-boiled detective showing up to save the day and rewriting the article into a noir screenplay) -- but both [[*user shaggydredlocks]] and [[*user communism-will-win]] pushed at me to rewrite it into an actual mystery rather than just a 'Murphy Law' fanfic. The end result is far better than its previous iteration. So, learning lesson for me: Don't be lazy. Novelty is neat, but using novelty to tell a compelling story is better.

Oh, yeah, and [[*user Decibelles]] deserves the credit for the final [REDACTED] attachment (though I deserve all the //blame// for the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinatown_(1974_film) Chinatown] joke and the [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-423 Fred] reference).

I really love a lot of the ideas in this one, but it's one of my lowest rated articles for what's probably a  pretty good reason -- the interview sucks. I need to rewrite it.  

I still like the fact that I was actually able to find a case where the [http://www.scp-wiki.net/manna-charitable-foundation-hub Manna Charitable Foundation] might actually be pretty reasonable (in not wanting anything to do with this guy). Also, this article contains my favorite self-authored footnote: //Before being amnesticized, witnesses provided confirmation that instances of SCP-3057-4 did, in fact, have feathers.// Because you know the Foundation would take note of that.

Also, you can thank [[*user weryllium]] for MTF Psi-2 ("Clever Girls").

This is another one inspired by a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mage:_The_Ascension Mage: The Ascension] campaign (specifically, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mage:_The_Ascension#Council_of_Nine_Mystic_Traditions Virtual Adepts]). I'm very happy with this piece -- it's not a novel idea (//kids trapped in a video game don't realize **THE GAME IS REAL**//), but I still think it manages to succeed via using a cliche to tell a novel and (hopefully) interesting story. Some have told me the story is a bit too silly and uplifting, but I can't always do dark. I start feeling fetishistic and gross if I don't let my characters sometimes achieve at least a //little// victory.

MTF Omega-9 ("The Scrubs") were previously called "Griefer Madness" (thanks to [[*user shaggydredlocks]]), which is a name I still love -- but it was pointed out that "Griefer" was a modern term. I also really like the simplicity behind 'the Scrubs'.

As of writing this, it's my lowest rated story. I haven't deleted it mostly because I //really like it//, and I'm hoping maybe over time it will catch on. I dunno -- sometimes I'm really surprised by what works and what doesn't.

Anyway, the idea was inspired by [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_061_LBonG8 this] song, [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1833 SCP-1833], my anxieties as a teenager -- and all the creepy camp-ground stories you might tell your friends around a fire.

I wrote this in about three hours. I was thinking about [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prestige_(film) The Prestige], and how 'real' magic can be pretty horrifying. It suddenly occurred to me that I had yet to see an SCP about stage magic. Initially, this was supposed to be a horror story about 'real magic' presented as stage magic, akin to the final twist in the Prestige -- with a centerpiece involving a high-school talent show where the boy's trick to saw his sister in half goes horribly wrong. But part way through writing the first few entries, I was struck by the image of a magician desperately trying to resurrect his dead daughter.

Then, from there, I realized it would be way more compelling if it was about a magician just trying to reconnect with his //estranged// daughter. Everything else flowed from there.

This came out of a conversation with [[*user Flawed]] regarding an idea with a Jenga tower that would cause conceptual collapses.

[[/module]]
So, I've wanted to write a SCP about a cemetery that grows anomalously for a while now; this premise went through a //lot// of iterations before finally popping out in its final form. Previously, it was a graveyard that ate people, but the mechanism seemed hokey (and it didn't feel very spooky to me); then, it became a graveyard for imaginary friends (an idea I still like). While writing some of the autopsy reports, I noticed I was 'escalating' each occurrence (making the imaginary friends scarier and scarier) -- and that's where I got the idea of a graveyard with iterative corpses all trying to escape. 

This, and the fact that I find the idea of natural selection/evolution to be terrifying. So the idea of applying that process to a person trying to dig her way out of her own grave seemed like a pretty scary and pretty great fit.

If I ever get around to it, I'd like to rewrite this scip to be more scientifically formal. There's a few things that don't make it 'right'; for example, the process of natural selection requires a pressure (survival of the genes). There's also the possibility of an alternative explanation (involving a suggestion/explanation from [[*user A Random Day]]) that I'd like to possibly explore.

This skip was inspired by an actual multi-level parking garage. While trying to find a space, we found 3 separate floors with //every single spot// marked as reserved (almost all of which were unoccupied). We kept wondering if the entire parking lot was just unoccupied and reserved -- which prompted me to comment on how that seemed a little 'Kafka-esque'. This prompted someone else to point out how a Kafka-esque parking lot was //itself// rather Kafka-esque (in the sense of how it invested something so trivial and banal with so much malevolence).

The end result isn't //quite// malevolent. This isn't a story about something that hates you. This is a story about something that just doesn't give a fuck about you -- and what you'll do to yourself to satisfy it.

My first attempt at a multi-part story. This opening took a while to get right -- I'm super-happy with it. It's basically a fusion between my love of 30s-era pulp-style magazines (with their excessive over-the-top gore) with a noir polish and a coating of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dresden_Files The Dresden Files] (which I've admittedly never read).

...and now looking at that wikipedia article, I see right away it contains a reference to the term 'semi-automagic', which I thought was kind of novel on my part. //Oh well//.

Anyway, one of the things I wanted to do with this is explore Sarkic themes in the context of a 1930s pulp-style story.

The second part of the Hartliss series. I'm less happy with this one; it was kind of an experimental thing I was trying out, when I should have probably gone with something more concrete. Still, I don't think it's //bad//... just a little artsy fartsy, especially considering the subject matter (hardboiled Sarkic detective investigating mysteries). Hopefully, the next (and final) piece will bring it back home with some straight-up two-fisted //justice//.

[[tab Advice]]

Whenever you compare yourself to another author and find yourself lacking, just remember this: Your unique background and set of experiences equips you to write stories they can't. 

There are stories inside of you that //only you alone// can tell. No one can take that away from you.

----

Need public domain/CC images? [https://pixabay.com/ Pixabay] and [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page Wiki Commons] are great sources. Just remember to save the links so you can provide them later! Also, double-check the licenses for each image to make sure it's something you can use.

----

Writing fiction is like exploring unknown territory. There's no 'right way' to go -- just lots of wrong ways. People can give you some helpful directions, ideas, and even a few places you might want to visit -- but no one can tell you where you're going or how you're getting there. That's just something you have to discover for yourself.

----

I don't care how shoddily written a piece of writing is: The author does not deserve to be ridiculed, mocked, or patronized. Don't do it -- and if someone tries to do it to you, don't put up with it.

----

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Style The Elements of Style] (by William Strunk Jr. and E. B. White) is a small paperback book that's around 50 to 70 pages long. It costs about $1.99 -- and if that's too rich for your blood, check your local library. Try to get the most recent edition if possible (older editions will contain errors, on account of grammar changing).

It's an excellent guide to concise, technical writing. I cannot recommend it highly enough.

----

Writing is not a magical, innate talent that you're born with. It's just like any skill: You need to hone it. The only reason people think otherwise is because writers just show you the finished product -- which perpetuates the illusion of writers as wizards who conjure a masterpiece out of thin-air. 

But the truth of it is this: Behind every great story is a **fuckton** of shitty ones.

----
Kurt Vonnegut once wrote 8 rules for writing; he went on to state that all but one can (and often will) be broken. "//Use the time of a total stranger in such a way that he or she will not feel the time was wasted.//" 

This is the only rule in writing you must not break. **//Never waste a reader's time.//**
