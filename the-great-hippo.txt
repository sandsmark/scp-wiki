[[collapsible show="► Want to write an SCP?" hide="▼ Here's some advice!"]]
* **Create a [http://scpsandbox2.wikidot.com/ sandbox] account.** Play around with your sandbox. Learn the ropes of wikidot code. This also gives you a chance to have a draft stored somewhere you can show others (and get feedback). 

* **Try to get [[[forum:start|feedback]]]!** I know it's frustrating; it can be a long time before anyone reads your article (and once they do, they may not provide you with anything you find useful -- or you might even get //contradicting// feedback!). But it's important, especially when you're first starting. If you stick around, you'll eventually find people you trust to give you feedback regularly -- and you'll learn what feedback to listen to, and what not to.

* **Need public domain/CC images?** [https://pixabay.com/ Pixabay] and [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page Wiki Commons] are great sources. Just remember to save the links so you can provide them later! Also, double-check the licenses for each image to make sure it's something you can use (Creative Commons 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0 are all fine!).

* **Make sure to cite your images!** Just because you found the perfect image doesn't mean you don't have to cite it! This is typically done in the discussion page for your SCP: Once you've posted your article, go to the **##red|Discuss##** link (at the bottom), click on **##red|New Post##** (again, at the bottom), and post the link(s) to any picture you used.

* **[[[how-to-write-an-scp|How To Write An SCP]]] is a pretty handy guide.** If anything else, it provides a good template to start with. Remember to properly format your SCP article (highlight things like **Item #:** and **Object Class:**).

* **Want to know how someone did something on their page?** Go to the very bottom of the page and click on **##red|+ Options##** in the bottom right corner. Then, click on **##red|Page Source##**. It'll give you the raw wikidot code used to construct the article page! Be careful; on some browsers, an extra space will be added in front of every line.

* **Don't expunge, redact, or blackbox (█) without an interesting reason.** In the past, it helped add to the credibility of these articles being produced by a shadowy organization -- but these days, it just comes off as lazy. 

* **Just go for it.** Writing is about self-expression and exploration. Sometimes, you just have to say "screw it" and dive in head-first. Maybe it'll work! Maybe it won't. It might get downvoted and deleted. That's okay -- writing is also about learning, and every failure teaches you something new. Try not to get too discouraged, and remember that behind every successful article there are dozens (if not hundreds) of failed ones. There is no such thing as "writing talent": No good writer was born good. They //became// good because they didn't let being lousy stop them from doing what they love.

The first SCP I wrote (and one of the easiest to finish). There's just something sinister about [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numbers_station number stations]. The sound sample was taken from an actual recording of one, slowed down and tweaked. Regrettably, I couldn't find a sound-file of a little Russian girl counting downwards (not one in the public domain, at least).

One day, I might take the interview out of this article. I think it's the weakest part of the piece, in retrospect; the dialogue is a bit cheesy and I think the article is stronger without it.

I started writing this before reading the excellent [http://www.scp-wiki.net/antimemetics-division-hub There Is No Antimemetic Division] series -- so I actually thought the twist was pretty novel. I still like it enough for what it is, though.

Regrettably, I think it's a little unclear -- people have told me they think it has a retro-causal effect (it doesn't; its effect is purely memetic). Might one day revisit it to make this more clear.

I mean, I knew it existed -- but I didn't know anything about it. I just needed a final movie to end the skip with, so I typed 'bee movies' in youtube, and... my GOD.

This one was inspired by a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mage:_The_Ascension Mage: The Ascension] campaign where a Marauder (think reality warper but lost in a delusion) was convinced he was in a 30s noir movie. The idea started as an unfinished noir movie script that was rewriting reality -- with the Foundation having to play along as characters in the script to contain it (and help it find an appropriate ending). Then it occurred to me that it might be way cooler if the script was the hero, with the anomaly as the villain. 

**Sidenote:** My initial draft was much less compelling, and relied on the pure novelty of the idea (a hard-boiled detective showing up to save the day and rewriting the article into a noir screenplay) -- but both [[*user shaggydredlocks]] and [[*user communism-will-win]] pushed at me to rewrite it into an actual mystery rather than just a 'Murphy Law' fanfic. The end result is far better than its previous iteration. So, learning lesson for me: Don't be lazy. Novelty is neat, but using novelty to tell a compelling story is better.

Oh, yeah, and [[*user Decibelles]] deserves the credit for the final [REDACTED] attachment (though I deserve all the //blame// for the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinatown_(1974_film) Chinatown] joke and the [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-423 Fred] reference).

I really love a lot of the ideas in this one, but I think it needs a serious rewrite. The interview is kind of clunky and I feel like the incidents could have focused on more interesting prehistoric organisms. 

I still like the fact that I was actually able to find a case where the [http://www.scp-wiki.net/manna-charitable-foundation-hub Manna Charitable Foundation] might actually be pretty reasonable (in not wanting anything to do with this guy). Also, this article contains my favorite self-authored footnote: //Before being amnesticized, witnesses provided confirmation that instances of SCP-3057-4 did, in fact, have feathers.// Because you know the Foundation would take note of that.

I'm very happy with this piece -- it's not a novel idea (//kids trapped in a video game don't realize **THE GAME IS REAL**//), but I still think it manages to succeed via using a cliche to tell a novel and (hopefully) interesting story. Some have told me the story is a bit too silly and uplifting, but I can't always do dark. I start feeling fetishistic and gross if I don't let my characters sometimes achieve at least a //little// victory.

MTF Omega-9 ("The Scrubs") were previously called "Griefer Madness" (thanks to [[*user shaggydredlocks]]), which is a name I still love -- but it was pointed out that "Griefer" was a modern term. I also really like the simplicity behind 'the Scrubs'.

This piece took a while to catch on, and it didn't start getting upvotes until I linked it to Cragglewood Park (see below). I'm often surprised by what works and what doesn't -- to me, this is just a fun little horror story in the style of series 1. 

[[*user theduckman]] gave me the chance to place something in one of their slots (replacing an old article about an axe); I'm very thankful for that opportunity (since it means I get to have a series 1 article despite being a relatively new author!). This idea was inspired by [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_061_LBonG8 this] song, [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1833 SCP-1833], my anxieties as a teenager -- and all the creepy camp-ground stories you might tell your friends around a fire.

I wrote this in about three hours. I was thinking about [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prestige_(film) The Prestige], and how 'real' magic can be pretty horrifying. It suddenly occurred to me that I had yet to see an SCP about stage magic. Initially, this was supposed to be a horror story about 'real magic' presented as stage magic, akin to the final twist in the Prestige -- with a centerpiece involving a high-school talent show where the boy's trick to saw his sister in half goes horribly wrong. But part way through writing the first few entries, I was struck by the image of a magician desperately trying to resurrect his dead daughter.

Then, from there, I realized it would be way more compelling if it was about a magician just trying to reconnect with his //estranged// daughter. Everything else flowed from there.

This came out of a conversation with [[*user Flawed]] regarding an idea with a Jenga tower that would cause conceptual collapses. It lead to an idea about a Jenga tower which caused //actual// collapses (in whatever structure it was contained within), which -- eventually -- led me to the idea of it also being able to cause financial collapses.

This article exposes my obsession with [[*user minmin]]'s [[[SCP-2747|anafabula]]]; the idea of a narrative that destroys the narrative containing it. I linked that idea to this article, expanding the concept to imply that either AWCY stumbled into something much more sinister, or the Chaos Insurgency is pulling a fast one on the Foundation (hence the tag).

So, I've wanted to write a SCP about a cemetery that grows anomalously for a while now; this premise went through a //lot// of iterations before finally popping out in its final form. Previously, it was a graveyard that ate people, but the mechanism seemed hokey (and it didn't feel very spooky to me); then, it became a graveyard for imaginary friends (an idea I still like). While writing some of the autopsy reports, I noticed I was 'escalating' each occurrence (making the imaginary friends scarier and scarier) -- and that's where I got the idea of a graveyard with iterative corpses all trying to escape. 

This, and the fact that I find the idea of natural selection/evolution to be terrifying. So the idea of applying that process to a person trying to dig her way out of her own grave seemed like a pretty scary and pretty great fit.

If I ever get around to it, I'd like to rewrite this scip to be more scientifically formal. There's a few things that don't make it 'right'; for example, the process of natural selection requires a pressure (survival of the genes). There's also the possibility of an alternative explanation (involving a suggestion/explanation from [[*user A Random Day]]) that I'd like to possibly explore.

This skip was inspired by an actual multi-level parking garage. While trying to find a space, we found 3 separate floors with //every single spot// marked as reserved (almost all of which were unoccupied). We kept wondering if the entire parking lot was just unoccupied and reserved -- which prompted me to comment on how that seemed a little 'Kafka-esque'. This prompted someone else to point out how a Kafka-esque parking lot was //itself// rather Kafka-esque (in the sense of how it invested something so trivial and banal with so much malevolence).

The end result isn't //quite// malevolent. This isn't a story about something that hates you. This is a story about something that just doesn't give a fuck about you -- and what you'll do to yourself to satisfy it.

I'm not gonna lie: Writing another Murphy Law story after the first one was intimidating, mostly because I knew it had to be //meta as fuck// -- but not so meta that it made it any harder to read. I'm really happy with the result; I feel like it's got at least three or four levels to it, while simultaneously still just being a fun read on the surface level.

Now that I've done this, I also feel like I can relax for the next story. By establishing Murphy Law as a credible metafictional entity, I can lay back and concentrate on just making him fun to read.

A conversation with [[*user weryllium]] (and a few others who I can't recall) in IRC generated the idea of writing a skip based around [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosperity_theology prosperity theology]. I wasn't sure where to go with it -- up until I started watching sermons given by [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Osteen Joel Osteen] and was immediately reminded of the same sort of smug self-involvement and 'win-by-any-means' nonsense from PUAs like [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Strauss Neil Strauss]. I then imagined 'Prosperity Gospel + [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3004 Imago] + [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2852 Cousin Johnny]' spreading to the next 'generation' -- and the rest was easy.

This skip is based on a deep, primal fear of mine: That people like this are right. That the shape of the universe is one in which people like Osteen are natural successes; rather than the meek, //they// will inherit the earth. They are the Chosen, and we are here only to provide for their needs before we die. Also, it's based on my mortal terror of cicadas, which [[*user kinchtheknifeblade]]'s skips have only served to solidify.

On a final note, I'm just gonna come right out and say it: This skip is also based on the fact that Donald Trump is the fucking President. To me, he and shit-fuckers like Osteen and Strauss all share the same fundamental 'genetic code'.

Formerly called 'Hyakumonogatari Kaidankai', I changed the name once I realized that the reference was possibly too esoteric (at least for Western audiences), and possibly likely to turn people away. This skip was the result of me discovering some beautiful images of Portugal's [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinta_da_Regaleira Initiation Wells], and creating a bunch of neat-looking photos via GIMP. I wanted to build a skip around these photos, but I couldn't figure out a good idea; it was then that I came up with the premise that maybe that's the problem. They're not images of a monster; they're images //looking// for a monster. 

The premise is partly inspired by [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyakumonogatari_Kaidankai Hyakumonogatari Kaidankai], which is a game in Japan where you summon a spirit by telling unrelated spooky stories.

I had this idea for a Meta-Mafia -- organized fictional crime. I was thinking about the disposal of fictional evidence when it occurred to me how handy it would be if you could dispose of //real// evidence this way. 

Most of the work that followed was figuring out the details. If you store a body in //Hamlet//, is it in every copy? What about translations of //Hamlet// -- will it show up there too? Can I store the bodies in any work? Can I write fanfiction just to store bodies in? Etc. Once I got all that sorted, I decided to dump the Meta-Mafia idea (which would have made the article more comedic) and use the excellent [[[chicago-spirit|Chicago Spirit]]] instead (which made it spookier and tragic).

I wanted to write [[[scp-1730|SCP-1730]]], except "on a boat". My idea was that a ship carrying low-risk anomalies (think things in the [[[log-of-anomalous-items|Log of Anomalous Items]]]) experienced some sort of catastrophe, and all the low-risk anomalies turned into one really big high-risk one. I started doing research on ship crashes and naval disasters, then started reading up again about the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepwater_Horizon_oil_spill Deepwater Horizon oil spill] and all the finger-pointing BP, Halliburton, and Transocean engaged in. That's when it occurred to me: I had never seen a skip that was all about the Foundation getting fucked over on account of their contractors producing shitty equipment. 

I chose the Scranton Reality Anchor because it gave me a lot of narrative room to play with (since a faulty SRA can basically do anything I want it to). Anyway, I'm really, really proud of this piece for a number of reasons -- it's way different than most of my stuff (which focuses on the delivery of a very tight narrative -- this one pretty much just //meanders// to the end), it involves some of my favorite themes (old school Foundation vs new school), and it engages in some significant lore-building (something my articles almost never do). It also adds two new terms to the Foundation lexicon: 'paraphysicist' and 'morphogenic field' (which is just a fancy way of saying 'reality warping').

The 'joke' at the end is that [[[SCP-106|106]]] is, according to [[*user psul]]'s excellent [[[until-death|Until Death]]], Scranton. Which means O5-5 is just really introducing DeVorn to the guy who invented this technology. I bet he's //super-eager// to hear about Daniel DeVorn's improvements.

Also, O5-5 was by far my favorite character to write in this piece. She's basically everybody's sweet old grandmom, except instead of baking you cookies she'll murder your enemies and hide the bodies.

I wrote this essay because I noticed a lack of essays regarding tale-writing -- prose in particular. Good prose is hard; in a lot of ways, it can seem almost like magic. I wanted to break down the magic and try to get across ways a writer can accomplish it in a straightforward fashion.

I have no idea where this is supposed to go. I just really liked the idea of a universe where the Foundation is 'reversed'; containing science rather than 'miracles'.

My first attempt at a multi-part story. This opening took a while to get right -- I'm super-happy with it. It's basically a fusion between my love of 30s-era pulp-style magazines (with their excessive over-the-top gore) with a noir polish and a coating of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dresden_Files The Dresden Files] (which I've admittedly never read).

...and now looking at that wikipedia article, I see right away it contains a reference to the term 'semi-automagic', which I thought was kind of novel on my part. //Oh well//.

Anyway, one of the things I wanted to do with this is explore Sarkic themes in the context of a 1920s pulp-style story.

The second part of the Hartliss series. I'm less happy with this one; it was kind of an experimental thing I was trying out, when I should have probably gone with something more concrete. Still, I don't think it's //bad//... just a little artsy fartsy, especially considering the subject matter (hardboiled Sarkic detective investigating mysteries). Hopefully, the next (and final) piece will bring it back home with some straight-up two-fisted //justice//.

The third (and final) part of the Hartliss series. I'm pretty happy with this, even though it took forever to produce. Needless author head-cannoning: Reinhardt is responsible for Cragstaff Sanitarium ([[[SCP-3054]]]).

[[tab Advice]]

Never put out a grease fire with water. Water expands by a ratio of 1:1600 when it boils at atmospheric pressure. This means every drop of water that hits burning grease will instantly explode into a ball of steam that is //over one thousand times larger// than the droplet. In other words, you will turn a grease fire into a flaming hurricane of burning oil and death. 

Instead, snuff the fire by putting something over it (like a metal plate). If you have no other option, use a CO,,2,, or chemical extinguisher (//not// a water extinguisher -- also, don't aim //into// the grease; just skim across the top!). 

----

Whenever you compare yourself to another author and find yourself lacking, just remember this: Your unique background and set of experiences equips you to write stories they can't. There are stories inside of you that //only you and you alone// can tell. No one can take that away from you.

----

Don't use hydrogen peroxide or rubbing alcohol on a paper-cut. Both of these chemicals evaporate very quickly, which removes moisture from your skin -- and part of what makes paper-cuts hurt so much and for so long is the skin drying out (causing the skin to retract, which in turn causes the cut to expand and deepen). Instead, immediately keep it moist with saliva (gross, but it works) until you can wash it off with some soap and water. Then, use petroleum jelly and/or an antibiotic cream beneath a small bandage to keep it clean, moisturized, and sealed.

----

Writing fiction is like exploring unknown territory. There's no 'right way' to go -- just lots of wrong ways. People can give you some helpful directions, ideas, and even a few places you might want to visit -- but no one can tell you where you're going or how you're getting there. That's just something you have to discover for yourself.

----

Own a cat? Never clean your cat-litter box with bleach. Cat urine is filled with ammonia, and ammonia mixed with bleach produces [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorine_gas_poisoning chlorine gas]. Just use ordinary (bleach-free) soap, hot water, and a scrub-brush.

----

I don't care how shoddily written a piece of writing is: The author does not deserve to be ridiculed, mocked, or patronized. Don't do it -- and if someone tries to do it to you, don't put up with it.

----

If you ever find yourself confronted by a bear in the woods, here's what you do: Pick up any small 
children that are with you immediately. Let the bear know where you are (talk to them, it doesn't matter what you say). Don't act scared. Don't get between them and any of their escape routes. Try to make yourself look as large as possible. Don't run, don't climb a tree, don't make sudden moves; if you can, try to move (SLOWLY) away. Also, make sure you're paying attention to your surroundings: You do //not// want to get between a mother and her cubs. 

You can find more bear-safety advice [https://www.nps.gov/subjects/bears/safety.htm here].

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Style The Elements of Style] (by William Strunk Jr. and E. B. White) is a small paperback book that's around 50 to 70 pages long. It costs about $1.99 -- and if that's too rich for your blood, check your local library. Try to get the most recent edition if possible (older editions will contain errors, on account of grammar changing).

It's an excellent guide to concise, technical writing. I cannot recommend it highly enough.

----

Writing is not a magical, innate talent that you're born with. It's just like any skill: You need to hone it. The only reason people think otherwise is because writers just show you the finished product -- which perpetuates the illusion of writers as wizards who conjure a masterpiece out of thin-air. 

But the truth of it is this: Behind every great story is a **fuckton** of shitty ones.

----

Kurt Vonnegut once wrote 8 rules for writing; he went on to state that all but one can (and often will) be broken. "//Use the time of a total stranger in such a way that he or she will not feel the time was wasted.//" 

This is the only rule in writing you must not break. **//Never waste a reader's time.//**
