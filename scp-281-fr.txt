**Item #:** SCP-281-FR

**[[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/niveaux-de-menace-des-objets-scp|Threat Level]]]:** Green [[span style="color:green"]]●[[/span]]

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-281-FR is currently confined in a reinforced tungsten containment constraint within Local Site-Daoud, an enclosed 50 m² site located within Zone-88: a military and scientific base officially belonging to the United States of America but operated by the Global Occult Coalition.

At least four agents must be positioned at Local Site-Daoud at all times. Regular supplies must be provided by air.

All censorship and disinformation operations have been managed by the Global Occult Coalition since the 1950s. These operations include shifting the official South Pole 4 km from SCP-281-FR's location, and falsifying various kinds of information concerning the history of expeditions to Antarctica since 1911 and the fundamental geological and astronomical nature of the Earth.

__Regarding the GOC:__ Local Site-Daoud is under regular pressure from the Global Occult Coalition, which is seeking to appropriate SCP-281-FR for security, strategical, political and/or religious reasons that are still unclear. These claims have lasted since the object was contained by the Foundation in 1948 and the late arrival of the Coalition's forces on-site. However, given the diplomatic relations between the GOC and the Foundation, these pressures are so far not military in nature. In the event that this situation changes, the Bel Protocol must be initiated.

__Regarding ORIA:__ SCP-281-FR is currently at the heart of the Jihad of the Nine: a medium-scale military-religious conflict with the Office For The Reclamation of Islamic Artifacts of Iran, whose claim of SCP-281-FR was one of the founding objectives. Due to the significant geographical distance between the South Pole and ORIA bases, jihad operations against Local Site-Daoud are rare but significant, performed mainly using thaumaturgical means.[[footnote]]Which includes transport circles, //spell-eater// ammunition, and local deformations of reality.[[/footnote]] Site-Daoud's isolated location within Zone-88 means that these Islamic operations are managed mainly by the GOC's armed forces. In the event that this situation changes, the Ea Protocol must be initiated.

__Regarding a K-Class Scenario:__ According to the founding Islamic texts, several of SCP-281-FR's components would be called upon to be recovered and used during Revelation-Type end-of-the-world events by Class-VII or higher Reality Manipulators. SCP-281-FR-5 is assumed to be recovered by the prophet Ali during the Last Judgment, whereas SCP-281-FR-1 is assumed to be recovered by the prophet Jesus to fight the Antichrist. In the event that this situation occurs, the Anu Protocol must be initiated.

In any case, it is assumed that removing one of the components of SCP-281-FR, or damaging its integrity, could cause an XK-Class event.

**Description:** SCP-281-FR is a set of nine swords of various shapes and sizes similar in style to the Arab weaponry of the late 7^^th^^ century CE. These swords are comprised of various metals, with iron or bronze blades and handles of gold, silver, or copper including leather, traces of ivory, or precious stones. These swords are classified SCP-281-FR-1 to 9. All are planted approximately 15 cm in the ground at a single point, at the Earth's exact geographic South Pole (latitude: 90° South, longitude: irrelevant).

When SCP-281-FR was discovered on-site and reported to the SCP Foundation in October 1947, SCP-281-FR was accompanied by a sign reading:

[[=]]
> [[size 150%]]PLS
> THANK YOU FOR NOT TOUCHING THE SWORDS[[/size]]
> UNDER PENALTY OF GIVING THE IMPRESSION THAT THE WORLD WAS DESTROYED
> WHICH WOULD WORRY A LOT OF PEOPLE OVER NOTHING
> SINCERELY YOURS
> SAPPHIRE
[[/=]]

Officially, and especially in diplomatic relations with the Global Occult Coalition and its partner States, the Foundation has always respected this sign and has never attempted to take action on SCP-281-FR.

Unofficially, all attempts to remove some or all of SCP-281-FR have ended in failure, whether by human, mechanical, or thaumaturgical means.

All attempts were abandoned upon the discovery of several sensitive documents (see Addenda). It is assumed that SCP-281-FR is an essential element of the globe's geological structure, and that damaging its integrity could potentially cause the discontinuation of the terrestrial globe.

SCP-281-FR's irremovability is due to an attractive force of several hundred million Newtons of undetermined origin exerted by each of its components on the other components. This force of attraction does not seem to apply to objects other than SCP-281-FR's components.

The Department of Theology proposed the hypothesis that each component of SCP-281-FR must have its own abnormal capability, which could manifest itself when each component is individually used as a weapon. This hypothesis cannot be proven because of SCP-281-FR's irremovability.

**Addendum 1:** GoI-096-E46 Epistolary Documents

The following documents were taken from a letter exchange maintained in 1946 between Hervé Malesherbes, former professor of applied mathematics at the Sorbonne University in Paris, and Patrick Silverstein, former consultant [DATA EXPUNGED], never found.

These letters were recovered during the dismantling of the Lodge of Paris in 2003 by Mobile Task Force Omega-5 ("The Jewellers").

> To my very dear colleague Professor Hervé Malesherbes
> Head of the Lodge of Paris
> 
> My Dear Friend,
> I hope everything is going well for you, and that you do not have too many properties to rebuild in the Old Continent. I heard about your last operation, where the whole parish was put into orbit for a few minutes, just to properly show them that the Earth was round. Too bad they were brought back a little bit too late, but I'm sure they had the time to fully realize their mistake before they passed away. What better show than the Truth after all?
> 
> We have the same kind of problem here, known as the Universal Zetetic Society:[[footnote]]Renamed to the "Flat Earth Society" in 1956, still active to this day.[[/footnote]] a bunch of retards who not only refuse to accept centuries of concrete and proven scientific evidence, but also claim to be zetetic and rational while doubting the official agencies, which they believe lie to them for personal gain! Imagine the image they give of real zetetic groups like us.
> 
> Fortunately I have some good news, for the both of us, which is the subject of this entire letter: some colleagues working at NASA have assured me that thanks to Paperclip,[[footnote]]Operation Paperclip was a major exfiltration operation of former Nazi scientists in the USA, a significant part of which worked in the American aerospace sector.[[/footnote]] a V2 ballistic missile should be sent into the mesosphere for purely scientific purposes between now and the 24th of October. And it will be equipped with a camera! Finally, we will have photographic and indisputable evidence that the Earth is round, to be widely broadcast, an unstoppable means of popularization, which should eliminate the bad skeptics from the landscape. 
> 
> Tell me if you are interested, I will send you a copy of these photographs as soon as possible, so that SAPPHIRE's European lodges can have them ahead of all the media.
> 
> With kind regards,
> Patrick V. Silverstein


> 1946/02/20
> To my very dear colleague Professor Patrick Silverstein
> Head of the Lodge of New York
> 
> My Dear Friend,
> I thank you warmly for so actively following -- and appreciating! -- the activities of the Lodge of Paris. The "flatists", as they say in the jargon, are definitely a plague. Skepticism must apply in the face of the Illogical, not the Logical; otherwise, it is little more than monstrous bigotry.
> 
> SAPPHIRE members in France will gladly take your photographs of the Earth from above! The weight of words, the shock of photographs, isn't it? Fighting against the most harmful communities of Christianity, in particular, seems to me to be the priority at this time. We can't even debate peacefully with these Jewish morons anymore without being looked at wrong now. The politically correct, you know how it is.

> Head of the Lodge of Paris
> 
> My Dear Friend,
> As the Society's representative on the Council of 108, I was able to take advantage of today's session at the Global Occult Coalition to evoke concern for the aesthetic and purely illusory appearance of our beautiful planet; namely that, as seen from space, the globe appears to resemble a flat disc bordered by a large ice wall. Apparently, among the 107 other organizations that were brought together in the Coalition, a large part of them were already aware of this optical effect.
> 
> I began by thanking them, all of them, for having striven all this time to triumph the Truth of the Round Earth, and for having hidden from the world's population this unpleasant impression that the Earth is flat. It is very courageous of the New World Order to fight against a Singularity giving the impression to every human being that the Earth is flat, instead of imposing sometimes by somewhat repressive means, certainly, but necessarily, the scientific evidence demonstrating that it is a globe.
> 
> I was greeted by an awkward silence. A silence so deafening that I still have overdeveloped hearing, the opposite of tinnitus. For you see, the problem is that they themselves are convinced that the Earth is flat, and they believe they are lying to the world when they are actually telling the truth. You can imagine the discomfort in the ranks of the Council. The Bavarian Illuminati no longer knew where to stand and the Free-Masons pretended to look for lint on their ceremonial dresses.
> 
> But either way, let's ignore that. Appearances are kept, that's what counts. I then asked them if SAPPHIRE had permission to fix this little aesthetic problem. Give back to the globe the appearance it should have.
> 
> It was certainly the silence that followed that gave me my current anti-tinnitus.
> 
> The assembly stayed to watch me, staring and silent, for something like a quarter of an hour before anyone dared to get up. I think they were in shock. The one who got up was, without much surprise, the Supreme Master Abraham of the Illuminati. I've never heard him stutter before, and I don't think anyone else has either.
> 
> "You... you want to make the Earth... round?" he told me.
> 
> You will understand that I had the sudden laziness to tell him that, no, the Earth was already round, and that we were just going to make it look the way it should. I decided instead to move directly into technical considerations.
> 
> Hence my question: do you still have the nine swords of Muhammad in stock?
> 
> With kind regards,
> Patrick Silverstein
 
> 1946/11/16
> To my very dear colleague Professor Patrick Silverstein
> Head of the Lodge of New York
> 
> I confirm that we should be able to gather the swords of Muhammad. Singularities BRO-2562-ISL 2, 3, and 4 must have taken dust at the Lodge of Marseille; at last news, they were doing tests to verify that their attraction was indeed of magnetic origin and not unique. Unfortunately, it is, and no force manifests itself once in their sheaths. BRO-2562-ISL 7 is hidden somewhere in the Lodge of Cairo. I sent a letter to Professor Riegmann.
> 
> As for BRO-2562-ISL 1, 5, 8, and 9, they were stolen by the Thule Society to serve the strange rituals of the Nazis, but were recovered during the Liberation and should now be stored in a crate lost in the Louvre's reserves; nothing that is unrecoverable.
> 
> I'll put this all together and keep you more fully informed as things progress. We'll see you at the Inter-Lodge Summit anyway, won't we? You can then be able to share with us all the projects that are germinating in your mind.
> 
> With kind regards,
> Hervé Malesherbes

**Addendum 3:** GOC-281-01 Archive Document

The following document was taken from the archives of the Platform: a cutting-edge top-secret proto-informatics network implemented to enable members of the Council of 108, constituting the High Command of the Global Occult Coalition, to communicate remotely in real-time.[[footnote]]Roughly comparable to a social network; 50 years ahead of its time, the existence of the Platform was only discovered in 1995.[[/footnote]]

A copy of these archives was provided to us by an anonymous informant, code-named "Pinhead", in 1999.

**The Bavarian Illuminati** appeal to the Pactisants of the New World Order.

You have been heard, and your fears are legitimate. What process do they intend to use?
What will happen to the colonies established on the other side? What about the Great Eye? What about our diplomatic relations with the Vril-ya?

We hear you and want to reassure you.

The Society of the Atheist Partisans of Progress for the Halt of the Irrational and Religious Enemy is, as you know, difficult to regulate and very discreet, but harmless. The initial plans for the Galileo Project were to be communicated to us last Monday -- they weren't, but Professor Silverstein announced a delay and assured us that they would be, as soon as the details were finalised. He insisted on the problems of independence dear to the Atheist Society, which have already been debated here.

**The United Church of Satan** reminds the fifty-two pactisants of the New World Order that are of para-religious nature that the Law of Cordial Secularism is, until further notice, the norm within the Council, and that any criticism of the choices and practices of the Atheist Society is taken into account but irrelevant within the Coalition's formal framework.

**The members of the Majestic 12** point out that concerning the suspicions of destruction of the Earth's hidden side, the sketches of the Galileo Project seem to aim at closing the Glacial Border, contracting it to form a second pole on the planet. The hidden side would, therefore, be preserved, but would constitute the inner surface of an empty globe.

The continental tunnels leading to the other side should not suffer too much from the transition from the Flat Earth to the Hollow Earth. New ones will probably be established, as well as a surveillance base, in Antarctica.

**The Vril Society** declares that it is very enthusiastic about the idea of literally closing the Vril territory's borders, definitively solving the problem of migrants who cross the Edge of the World to settle on their territory, taking the place of honest citizens in cold blood.

The Shambhala chain will be pulled so that the second moon does not cause a collision when the Earth's crust closes. Once moved, the second moon will continue to be the source of light and heat fuelling the other side. It will be aligned to form the centre of the new globe and will establish a new balance.
