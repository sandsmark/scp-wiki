**Item #:** SCP-233

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-223 is to be kept within a cubical vanadium-lined container, dimensions 23 by 23 by 23.  The unit of measure is irrelevant. A 23-meter safe zone is to be established around the object: no personnel older or younger than 23 years of age are to be allowed within the safe zone. For optimal results, personnel with birthdays falling on the 23rd of the month should be used. No firearms other than those chambered for .223 caliber rounds are to be allowed within the safe zone. Shift changes will occur at 23 minutes past the hour, with the final shift change occuring at 2323 Greenwich Mean Time exactly.

Under no circumstances are [REDACTED]mm ammunition, personnel born in the month of [REDACTED] or on the [REDACTED], [REDACTED], or twenty-[REDACTED] of the month, or any [REDACTED]-sided object to be brought within the 23-meter safe zone.  Personnel are cautioned to take special care at [REDACTED] minutes past the hour, especially [REDACTED] hours, as this is the time period during which the object is most active. For best results, the 23-meter safe zone should be cleared of all personnel during that time period.

**Description:** SCP-233 is a 23-sided polyhedron, each face being made up of both an equilateral triangle and a straight line simultaneously. Because of the space-time altering nature of the object, the exact physical makeup of the object cannot be emulated in three-dimensional or two-dimensional form.

SCP-233 has the unusual property of altering the laws of mathematics in its vicinity, causing rounding errors to occur unless calculated using a base-23 system.  In addition, it appears to have deleterious effects on any object with significant properties indivisible by 23, causing slow degradation of the molecular bonds within the object's structure.

SCP-233 has a particularly violent effect upon occurances of the number [REDACTED] (see report re: death of Dr. Nana [REDACTED] on [DATE REDACTED].)  Chemical breakdown of the effected object proceeds at 23 times the normal rate in these cases: direct contact results in immediate destruction of the object in question by breakdown into component atoms within .23 seconds.

One note: SCP-233 appears to be triggered not by the actual physical properties of the object in question in any empirical sense, but by the perceptions of nearby observers. For instance, it is safe to handle SCP-233 using a 108-inch long pole, so long as no observers within the danger zone percieve said pole as being [REDACTED] feet in length.  The reason for this is unknown, but the Observer Effect recorded in classical quantum physics may be involved (see report 77-Heisenberg).

**Addendum:** Upon the recommendation of Dr. A. Clef, the SCP committee is petitioned to redesignate this object as SCP-2323, following Incident [REDACTED] during which the object's accidental contact with a [REDACTED]-volt battery used to power a personal music device caused an approximately [REDACTED]-thousand percent increase in the object's range of effect to 232.32 kilometers, resulting in deaths of the entire home team at a nearby AAA league baseball game (said game being at the top of the [REDACTED] inning at the time), and the destruction of all computer files containing information on SCP-233's interaction with the number [REDACTED].  For the safety of all personnel, future reference to the number [REDACTED] in conjunction with SCP-233 is to be avoided at all costs.

**Addendum 2:** Under no circumstances are pregnant female personnel to be allowed within the safe zone.
