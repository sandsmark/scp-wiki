**Item #:** SCP-233

**Object Class:** Keter (NEUTRALIZED)

**Special Containment Procedures:(NO LONGER APPLICABLE, PLEASE SEE ADDENDUM-C)** SCP-223 is to be kept within a cubical vanadium-lined container, dimensions 23 by 23 by 23.  The unit of measure is irrelevant. A 23-meter safe zone is to be established around the object: no Class D personnel older or younger than 23 years of age are to be allowed within the safe zone. For optimal results, Class D personnel with birthdays falling on the 23rd of the month should be used. No firearms other than those chambered for .223 caliber rounds are to be allowed within the containment chamber. Shift changes will occur at 23 minutes past the hour, with the final shift change occuring at 2323 Greenwich Mean Time exactly.

Under no circumstances are [REDACTED]mm ammunition, Class D personnel born in the month of [REDACTED] or on the [REDACTED], [REDACTED], or twenty-[REDACTED] of the month, or any [REDACTED]-sided object to be brought within the 23-meter safe zone.  Personnel are cautioned to take special care at [REDACTED] minutes past the hour, especially [REDACTED] hours, as this is the time period during which the object is most active. For best results, the 23-meter safe zone should be cleared of all personnel during that time period.

**Description:** SCP-233 is a 23-sided polyhedron, each face being made up of both an equilateral triangle and a straight line simultaneously. Because of the space-time altering nature of the object, the exact physical makeup of the object cannot be emulated in three-dimensional or two-dimensional form.

SCP-233 has the unusual property of altering the laws of mathematics in its vicinity, causing rounding errors to occur unless calculated using a base-23 system. Mathematical calculations carried out in base 23, however, have the benefit of being carried out at 23 times the normal speed: for this reason, destruction of the item has been postponed pending possible integration into [DATA EXPUNGED]. The difficulty of converting binary information into base-23 mathematics aside, the device has already shown its value to the Organization (see report 234[REDACTED] by Dr. Nana [REDACTED] regarding her "unusual solution" to the Unified Field Theory.)

Unfortunately, SCP-233 appears to have a particularly violent effect upon occurances of the number [REDACTED] occurring within its safe zone (see report re: death of Dr. Nana [REDACTED] on [DATE REDACTED].)  Chemical breakdown of the affected object proceeds at a rapid rate: direct contact results in immediate destruction of the object in question by breakdown into component atoms within .23 seconds.

One note: SCP-233 appears to be triggered not by the actual physical properties of the object in question in any empirical sense, but by the perceptions of nearby observers. For instance, it is safe to handle SCP-233 using a 108-inch long pole, so long as no observers within the danger zone percieve said pole as being [REDACTED] feet in length.  The reason for this is unknown, but the Observer Effect recorded in classical quantum physics may be involved (see report 77-Heisenberg).

**Addendum 233-a:** Upon the recommendation of Dr. A. Clef, the research committee has petitioned to redesignate this object as SCP-2323. Although this would place the item outside the standard numbering scheme, SCP-233's mathematical nature requires that utmost precautions be taken regarding all numbering schemes involving data related with the project.  This was dramatically illustrated during Incident [REDACTED] during which the object's accidental contact with a [REDACTED]-volt battery used to power a personal music device caused an approximately [REDACTED]-thousand percent increase in the object's range of effect to 232.32 kilometers, resulting in deaths of the entire home team at a nearby AAA league baseball game (said game being at the top of the [REDACTED] inning at the time), and the destruction of all computer files containing information on SCP-233's interaction with the number [REDACTED].  For the safety of all personnel, future reference to the number [REDACTED] in conjunction with SCP-233 is to be avoided at all costs.

**Addendum 233-b:** Under no circumstances are pregnant female personnel to be allowed within the safe zone.

**Addendum 233-c: Neutralization** 23 days after the introduction of the [[[SCP-999]]] to SCP-233 (resulting in the loss of the other sCP), SCP-233 underwent a sudden shift in form. Observers noted the facets of the device collapsing inwards, reshaping itself from an anomalous 23-sided form into a simple vanadium ring 23 cm in diameter, with a thickness of 23mm (SCP-233-Prime). All anomalous mathematical properties seem to have ceased: however, the two Class-D personnel present at the time of the shift underwent a psychological fugue state. Now referred to as SCP-233-01 and SCP-233-02, the two individuals in question now appear to share a single hive mind, finishing each others' sentences and operating in tandem. 

The following interview took place immediately after the event.

> Both: That Which Should Not Have Been Forged.
> SCP-233-02: The Sin of Man.
> SCP-233-01: By the Hands of Man Was it Made.
> Both: Upon the Heads of Man Shall the Curse Be Laid.

> //Who are you really?//
> 
> Both: We are the Prophets of the Sterling Ring.
> SCP-233-01: The Sterling Ring Shall Oppose the Scepter of the False God.
> SCP-233-02: For this purpose, and no other, was the Sterling Ring Created.
> Both: In the Halls of Freya, Reciever of Half the Slain, Shall You Find Wisdom.
> SCP-233-02: When the Two and Three.
> SCP-233-01: Meet the Twenty-Three.
> SCP-233-02: When the Scepter of the False God.
> SCP-233-01: Slays the Eight, and turns its eye to the Ninth.
> Both: Then Shall the End Times Come.
> 
> //Explain yourselves now! What is your intention? Are you hostile? What do you mean by End Times?//

> [At this point, both SCP-233-01 and 02 folded their arms across their chest and became unresponsive.]

Termination Order for SCP-233-01 and 02 has been recieved. Will carry out at the first available opportunity.

**Addendum 233-4** Containment Failure Incident on ██-██-████. SCP-233 Prime, SCP-233-1, and SCP-233-2 have escaped from Foundation custody. Immediate retrieval operations are underway. Evidence indicates that they may be carrying SCP-233 Prime to [[[SCP-023]]]
