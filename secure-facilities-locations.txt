title:Secure Facilities Locations
SCP Secure Facilities are labeled according to their function and their structure.  They contain a major designation and an optional prefix.



++ SCP-Facility Designation
**Command -** Facility where SCP commanders and heads of research make decisions concerning SCP containment and future research.  Militarized SCP Task Forces are also housed at these locations.  Because of the importance of these personnel, only SCP objects classified as '''Safe''' may be stored at these locations.

**Site-** A SCP facility that has been built around immobile SCP objects.  Objects may be of any class.

**Sector -** A large SCP facility with many functions, especially the housing and training of Class D personnel.  Typically houses SCP objects of '''Safe''' and '''Euclid''' class.

**Area-** A SCP facility built to contain '''Keter''' class objects.  Constructed far from civilian establishments, Areas house 'Elimination' grade nuclear weaponry to clear the facility and all personnel should containment be breached.

**Unit-** A small, clandestine facility that is typically found in a larger SCP facility.  The personnel of the larger, parent facility are typically kept unaware of the presence and/or function of the Unit facility because the SCP object there must be held in as much secrecy as possible.

++ Suitable SCP Facility Prefixes
The following is a list of available prefixes that may be attached to a facility designation to better describe its role.

**Research:**  SCP designation of a facility devoted toward study and experimentation on SCP objects.

**Storage:** SCP designation of a facility devoted toward storage of objects not currently being researched.

**Containment:**  SCP designation of a facility devoted toward containment of a SCP threat with little emphasis on research.

**Mobile:**  SCP designation of a facility or task force that must remain "on the move" to track, monitor or guard a moving SCP object.

**Bio:**  SCP designation of a facility devoted to the storage, containment, or researching of SCP objects with biological considerations.

**Armed:**  SCP designation of a facility with personnel equipped with suitable armament to repel an attack or contain an SCP threat beyond the capabilities of standard SCP Security personnel.

**Dimensional (Di/Dim):**  SCP designation of a facility devoted to researching or containing an SCP object with extra-dimensional capabilities that warp/distort normal space.

**Reliquary:** SCP designation of a facility devoted to research, containment or storage of SCP objects considered relics of historical or religious significance. 

Examples of SCP nomenclature:
