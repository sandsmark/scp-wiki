title:Secure Facilities Locations
SCP Secure Facilities are labeled according to their function and their structure.  They contain a major designation and an optional prefix.

[[[Task Forces]]] are now listed on their own page.

+ SCP Facility Designation

**Command:** Facility where Foundation commanders and heads of research make decisions concerning containment and future research. Task Forces are also housed at these locations. Because of the importance of these personnel, only SCP objects classified as Safe may be stored at these locations.

**Site:** Facility that had to be built around an immobile SCP object. These objects may be of any class.

**Sector:** Facility that is unusually large with many functions, one of which is housing and training Class-D personnel. Typically houses SCP objects of Safe and Euclid class.

**Area:** Facility built to contain Keter-class objects. Constructed far from civilian establishments, Areas house nuclear devices that can be used to clear the facility and terminate all facility personnel. These devices are detonated if the containment of a Keter-class object is breached and is not able to be contained again.

**Unit:** A small clandestine facility that is hidden within a typical SCP facility. The personnel of the parent facility are kept unaware of the presence and/or function of the hidden Unit.

+ Suitable SCP Facility Prefixes
The following is a list of available prefixes that may be attached to a facility designation or a [[[task-forces|task force]]] to better describe its role.

**Research:** Foundation designation for a facility devoted to study and experimentation on SCP objects.

**Storage:** Foundation designation for a facility devoted to storage of objects not currently being researched.

**Containment:** Foundation designation for a facility devoted to containment of an SCP that poses a threat and is not being researched.

**Mobile:** Foundation designation for a facility or Task Force that can remain "on the move" tracking, monitoring, or guarding a moving SCP object.

**Biological (Bio):** Foundation designation for a facility devoted to storage, containment, or research of SCP objects with special biological considerations.

**Armed:** Foundation designation for a facility with unusually well-armed Security personnel equipped to either repel attacks by national-level militaries or to contain SCP objects that pose military-grade threats that cannot be contained by the capabilities of standard Security personnel.

**Dimensional (Dim):** Foundation designation for a facility devoted to researching or containing an SCP object with extra-dimensional capabilities that warp or distort normal space.

**Reliquary:** Foundation designation for a facility devoted to research, containment, or storage of SCP objects considered relics of historical or religious significance.

+ List of Secure SCP Facilities
SCP document writers are encouraged to list noted facilities below along with Objects present.  Noted personnel and locations are optional.

++ **Commands**

* **Overwatch HQ:** This area is the headquarters of Overwatch, the group in charge of all SCP projects. Overwatch consists of the 13 Overseers, representatives from political entities, and high-ranking scientists. Overwatch directs new Site construction, new SCP designations, external political relations, and the appointment of all Level 4 personnel (who in turn administer the lower-level staff below them in a manner they see fit). The Overseers maintain a strict policy against any SCP ever being allowed at Overwatch HQ, even if the SCP is deemed totally safe or even beneficial. As a result, Overwatch HQ never houses any SCP. Overwatch, their staff, their Agents, and any other persons stationed at Overwatch HQ are instructed to avoid all contact with SCPs. The Overseers are especially judicious in avoiding such contact.

The [[[groups-of-interest#toc |Iranian Revolutionary Guard]]] runs the facility while culling scientists for high-paying jobs from the real-life University as they graduate. They have controlled or attempted to control [[[SCP-112-ARC]]] and [[[SCP-139]]] at this location.

* **Farsi Island:** This island in the Persian Gulf has the sole function of acting as an IRG military base. Foundation Operatives in the "September 5th" Project determined that this island is the most likely setting for the IRG to attempt to contain [[[SCP-112-ARC]]] or any Keter-Class artifacts they either do now control or will control in the future.
