+ Facility Designations

The Foundation maintains and operates a large number of facilities worldwide, from small outposts with only a handful of staff to major Sites with thousands of personnel.

++ Site

Foundation facilities designated as Sites are //covert// facilities, meaning that while existence of the facility is known to the public, such facilities are often disguised under government or corporate fronts. Sites are often built in locations in relatively close proximity to civilian populations, where facilities would require such cover.

++ Area

Foundation facilities designated as Areas are //clandestine// facilities, meaning that civilians are not aware of its existence at all. Such facilities are often built far away from civilian populations and may contain highly dangerous anomalies; the vast majority of Areas have extreme fail-safe measures such as on-site nuclear warheads.

+ Facility Sections

++ Sector

Sectors are sections of Sites or Areas that are designated for specific purposes, such as containment, research, or storage. The exact usage of Sectors vary from facility to facility and is dependent on the facility's primary purpose and size.

++ Unit
Units are self-contained sections of Sites or Areas such as those containing Biological or Dimensional anomalies and are designed to self-seal in case of a breach or other catastrophic event. All personnel entering or exiting a Unit must typically undergo a full decontamination procedure.

+ Prefixes

These prefixes are often used to denote specializations of facilities or facility sections and are generally only used in internal communication.

++ Armed

Armed denotes a facility or facility section with abnormally high physical security concerns, either due to containment of violent hostile entities or threat of outside attack. Such facilities typically have a large amount of military-grade weaponry and vehicles as well as a disproportionately large number of permanent security staff; in the case of a full facility, this typically entails a detachment of at least battalion or regiment strength.

++ Biological (Bio)

Biological containment facilities or facility sections deal with infectious or otherwise biohazardous anomalies and are both isolated and self-contained to prevent the possible escape of such anomalies.

++ Containment

Containment facilities or facility sections are primarily equipped and intended for the containment of anomalous objects, entities, or phenomena.

++ Dimensional (Dim)

Dimensional containment facilities or facility sections deal with extradimensional apertures or anomalies exhibiting inconsistent or warped spacetime.

++ Humanoid

Humanoid containment facilities or facility sections primarily deal with sentient, sapient human or near-human entities capable of understanding and complying with instructions. These are essentially analogous to a prison facility for anomalous entities.

++ Protected

Protected facilities and facility sections are "safe zones" kept free of anomalous influence. No anomalies are allowed within these facilities at any time.

++ Provisional

Provisional facilities are those that are established or built around an immobile anomaly. Provisional facilities typically contain only a single anomaly.

++ Reliquary

Reliquary facilities or facility sections are designed for handling artifacts and objects of religious or historical significance.

++ Research

Research facilities or facility sections are designed for either the handling and study of anomalies or anomalous materials or research and development of new containment schemes and methods.

++ Storage

Storage facilities or facility sections are intended for long-term storage of non-anomalous or inert anomalous objects with no risk of autonomous interaction.

+ Miscellaneous

These are Foundation facilities or locations that do not fall under the standard organizational structure.

++ Observation Posts

Observation Posts are tiny facilities established in a multitude of locations worldwide. Often limited to small standalone buildings or single units within larger buildings, Observation Posts are typically used to monitor regional communications for flagged content, as well as monitor nearby Foundation facilities. Many Observation Posts are also used as secure communications hubs or safe-houses by undercover Foundation agents.

+ Facilities List (Abridged)

The following is a partial list of notable Foundation facilities. Please note that this list is incomplete; many Foundation facilities are not listed here due to operational security requirements or because their purpose and/or location are classified. Many facility designations have also been recycled over time as the original facilities are decommissioned or otherwise no longer in use.

[[size 120%]]**What Is This?**[[/size]]

This is a list of Foundation facilities that have been extensively and/or consistently used across multiple site pages. The entries here are intended as inspiration and a sample of how Foundation facilities might look like and is not intended to be all-inclusive or exhaustive; there are plenty that are either not listed here due to only being used in a few obscure places or are inconsistently used. If you are writing and want to use a facility, you are free to make up your own.

Furthermore, in-universe, inconsistencies can also be explained via disinformation or timeliness of information; Site-06, for example, was not always located in France and is actually explicitly listed as the third such facility to receive the designation. Certain other sites might no longer be in operation or even been deliberately fabricated to mislead agents from rival organizations.

----
[[size 120%]]**Just How Big Is The Foundation?**[[/size]]

This is entirely up to the author. Some choose to believe that the Foundation is very small, consisting of only half a dozen facilities or less and no more than a thousand personnel. Some choose to believe that the Foundation is vastly larger and far-reaching, employing hundreds of thousands of personnel squirreled away in hundreds of facilities around the globe. Neither is incorrect and whatever works better to further your narrative is the one that's appropriate.

----
[[size 120%]]**Adding New Entries**[[/size]]

This list is intentionally kept as short as possible, therefore new entries should only be proposed for addition if they are consistently used across multiple articles and/or by multiple authors in the same manner. Please use the discussion thread for this guide to propose new additions.
