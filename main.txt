**News**

* **12/06/12** - [http://www.qwantz.com/index.php?comic=2334 Ryan "The Yellow Dart" North] thinks we're cool! Jimmy Wales continues to disagree...

* **10/16/12** - The Koreans have gotten in on the act, and have been added to our Content links. Here's to a long and fruitful partnership.

* **07/17/12** - All the required reading has received a significant update. The last documents are being uploaded now. Currently, the tag "[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/guide Guide]" is being reserved for things we feel are of significant value to the site and its members. Other advice documents have been given the tag "[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/essay Essay]" and can be found on the [[[Foundation Tales]]] page until otherwise decided. This is an ongoing process, and we're going to be working out the bumps of the next couple of days. Patience is appreciated.

* **06/11/12** - For the moment, we are banning the creation of any new Guides, as we trim out the ones we don't need. Thanks for understanding.

* **05/29/12** - Deletions policy has undergone a thorough review and been updated to clarify a few things, with changes made in light of recent growth. The core process remains the same, but you should take a moment to familiarize yourself with the changes, which are explained in the updated [[[Deletions Guide]]].

* **04/30/12** - I'll be honest. I've been around a //while//. Not many things impress my cold, jaded soul anymore. And then... This: **[http://scpcb.wordpress.com/ SCP-Containment Breach]**. I cannot easily express in words how amazingly awesome something like this is.  And this is just the bare bones of it. I think I speak for both the featured authors and the members of the wiki itself when I say: //We are both extremely grateful and awestruck that someone would like to craft something like this from something we helped create. Thank you and keep up the good work//.
