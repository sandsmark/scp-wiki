* [[[SCP-002]]] - The "Living" Room
 * A huge ball of tissue, like a massive tumor, with a heavy hatch door, leading in to...a small, crappy apartment.  A bit of a let down...until testing shows that everything inside is made from human beings.  Woven hair, sculpted bone, and other less pleasant materials make up the furniture...//and SCP-002 is always looking to grow.//
