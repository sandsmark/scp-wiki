* **03/07/12** Hmm... How interesting... There's **SCP [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0vlQQLPV0o Death Metal]**? Yes. Yes, there is. Lets get these kids some hits to say thanks, huh?
* **02/24/12** Sad times, all.  There's been a lot of excitement over the recent fan developed game of [[[SCP-087]]] (including a lot from the staff here and at [http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/02/21/the-neverending-stairway-scp-087/ other places]), but recent reports in the [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/realtime-chat site chat] (and forum threads such as [http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?s=e052a108f9ed5d4e3cda6aa549a82629&t=2564311 these]) have led us to suggest that users avoid downloading this game from untrustworthy sources.  Make sure you scan these files for viruses before you run them.

Enjoy!
