**News**

* **02/24/12** Sad times, all.  There's been a lot of excitement over the recent fan developed game of [[[SCP-087]]] (including a lot from the staff here and at [http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/02/21/the-neverending-stairway-scp-087/ other places]), but recent reports in the [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/realtime-chat site chat] (and forum threads such as [http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?s=e052a108f9ed5d4e3cda6aa549a82629&t=2564311 these]) have led us to suggest that users avoid downloading this game from untrustworthy sources.  Make sure you scan these files for viruses before you run them.

Yes, folks, that's right. **There is a group of people translating SCPs into Chinese!  Check them out [http://scpfoundation.123ubb.com/ here] and see what pages have been translated.** Currently, this is pretty embryonic (just a message board with posted translations), but tell me it doesn't make you proud that something you're working with has been translated into four languages, three scripts, and is read across the globe. Enjoy!
* **01/25/12** **Happy New Year!** Why not celebrate the new year with some good writing? Check out one of the newest and most quickly growing collaborations in Foundation history: **[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/gamedayindex Game Day]**.
