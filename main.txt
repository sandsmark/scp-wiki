**News**

* **06/11/12** - For the moment, we are banning the creation of any new Guides, as we trim out the ones we don't need. Thanks for understanding.

* **05/29/12** - Deletions policy has undergone a thorough review and been updated to clarify a few things, with changes made in light of recent growth. The core process remains the same, but you should take a moment to familiarize yourself with the changes, which are explained in the updated [[[Deletions Guide]]].

* **04/30/12** - I'll be honest. I've been around a //while//. Not many things impress my cold, jaded soul anymore. And then... This: **[http://scpcb.wordpress.com/ SCP-Containment Breach]**. I cannot easily express in words how amazingly awesome something like this is.  And this is just the bare bones of it. I think I speak for both the featured authors and the members of the wiki itself when I say: //We are both extremely grateful and awestruck that someone would like to craft something like this from something we helped create. Thank you and keep up the good work//.

* **04/15/12** - WARNING. WARNING. WARNING. //[[[SCP-993]]]// CONTAINMENT [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWH2g8Ox7bo BREACHED]. [http://www.scp-wiki.net/behind-the-scenes THIS IS NOT A DRILL].

* **04/14/12** - You all may remember **[[[Critters]]]** from a previous front page. Apparently, someone liked it so much that they did an audio recording! Holy cow! **[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MqWCrPHaBQ Critters]**!
