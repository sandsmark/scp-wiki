**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5109 must not be spoken. This restriction is waived in the event of an imminent threat to the life of its keeper; it __must__ then be spoken to that keeper's O5 Command contact via one-way radio transmitter. The identities of SCP-5109's present keeper and their O5 contact are classified Level 5: Top Secret.

Audio recording of SCP-5109 is prohibited.

--SCP-5109's default containment is the mind of Site-43 Identification and Technocryptography Chief Eileen Veiksaar. Chief Veiksaar may only speak SCP-5109 to personnel with Security Clearance Level 3: Confidential or Higher; they are then bound by this same restriction, and must return it to Chief Veiksaar at her request. Personnel carrying SCP-5109 are required to also carry a one-way radio transmitter with a direct line to Chief Veiksaar, to be used for transmission of SCP-5109 during life-threatening situations. Chief Veiksaar is to carry a one-way radio transmitter locked to the frequency of her designated O5 Command contact.--

--Updated 11/21/2014: Audio recording of SCP-5109 is prohibited.--

**Description:** SCP-5109 is a cognito-linguistic phenomenon, the comprehension and retention of a specific string of forty characters from the Latin alphabet and Arabic numeral set.[[footnote]] Alternative designations: linear meme, cognitive isolate.[[/footnote]] At any given time, precisely one person can properly recognize and conceive of this character string, thus "containing" SCP-5109 in their mind. All other persons will perceive any non-auditory representation of the character string as a jumble of unfamiliar, meaningless symbols (see above), will be unable to concentrate on it for more than a few seconds, and will forget it once their attention lapses.

Any individual in possession of SCP-5109 (hereafter its "keeper") will be unable to forget it until it has been transmitted to a new individual. Transmission is achieved by speaking SCP-5109 aloud, character-by-character, in the presence or telepresence of at least one other sentient being. The first such being to aurally receive SCP-5109 in this fashion will immediately memorize its characters, and the former keeper will forget them entirely. There is no established upper limit to the number of times an individual can possess SCP-5109; Site-43 Identification and Technocryptography Chief Eileen Veiksaar has received and relinquished SCP-5109 some forty-three times over a period of eleven years with no apparent consequence.

Background knowledge an individual does or does not possess about SCP-5109 is immune to its memetic effects. New keepers will not recognize the character string as anomalous until they are so informed or discover its nature themselves; former keepers do not forget the existence of SCP-5109, merely its essence. This essence cannot be reverse-engineered, and deductive reasoning will not allow the characters to be "guessed." SCP-5109 is only imprinted on a subject's consciousness through aural reception.

There is no evidence to suggest that SCP-5109 possesses agency or sentience. It does not affect the cognizance of its hosts except where memorization of the associated character string is concerned, and displays no cognizance of its own. Whether its phenomena represent an inherent property of languages using the Latin alphabet, an inherent property of human consciousness, an irreducible universal constant or a purposeful alteration of reality is not known. That the character string possesses a meaning in the English language, [EXPUNGED], does to some extent mitigate against all but the last of these possibilities.

**Addendum:** SCP-5109 first came to Foundation attention on 5/08/2009 (see below). Its nature was determined through experimentation; its origin remains unknown. 

The ongoing need to develop reliable security protocols for Foundation research led to a proposal by Chief Veiksaar: ongoing experimental use of SCP-5109 in sensitive research projects at Site-43. Chief Veiksaar's proposal was accepted on 01/14/2010. She became the //de facto// keeper of SCP-5109 when not in use, authorized to loan it out on a case-by-case basis. This practice was discontinued on 04/27/2020, Special Containment Procedures were amended, and Chief Veiksaar ceded SCP-5109 to O5 Command.

O5 Command is not accepting requests for the release of SCP-5109. Rationale can be found in the usage log excerpts retrieved from the Site-43 Network Database (43Net) reproduced below.

**05/08/2009:** During a routine credentials renewal, Dr. K. Elstrom speaks her 43NET password aloud via telephone to Identification and Technocryptography (I&T) technician W. Barkley. Barkley asks Dr. Elstrom to confirm the password by repeating it; she finds herself unable to do so. Dr. Elstrom asks that Barkley instead repeat the password back to her; when he refuses, citing protocol, she becomes extremely agitated and demands to speak to his supervisor.

**05/09/2009:** An I&T investigation determines the anomalous nature of the character string and it is transferred from Barkley to Eileen Veiksaar, Chief of I&T. Dr. Elstrom claims, under MARSTON verification protocol, to have no memory of the source of her former password. This claim is verified.

**01/28/2010 - 01/29/2010:** Dr. T. Bremmel claims SCP-5109 as the password for a secure network database. Site-43 Security and Containment Section (S&C) is alerted to a containment breach scenario in Dr. Bremmel's office the next day. Agents discover a Post-it note on Dr. Bremmel's terminal, containing his login information. At an emergency disciplinary hearing Dr. Bremmel reveals that the password on the note is not SCP-5109, but is instead a keyword pre-emptively flagged with S&C. Dr. Bremmel is detained at his own request, and his removal from Site-43 is announced via 43Net.

**02/04/2010:** Dr. Bremmel's former research assistant, Dr. S. Mollins, attempts three times to use the login and password from the Post-it note to remotely access Dr. Bremmel's secure database from his own office terminal. Charged with unauthorized access to a secured workspace and attempted credentials theft, Dr. Mollins is removed to Site-06-3 for detention. Dr. Bremmel returns SCP-5109 to Chief Veiksaar, never having used it.

**05/16/2010 - 05/19/2010:** Dr. E. LeClair claims SCP-5109 for use as the password for her tablet computer. Three days later she attempts to violate containment protocols for [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1693 SCP-1693] at Sector-25. When apprehended, she admits to undertaking private research for the treatment of Alzheimer's Disease. Health and Pathology Section assessment at Site-43 reveals that Dr. LeClair suffers from Mild Cognitive Impairment, proceeding rapidly to mild dementia. I&T reports multiple password requests originating from her office over the past month. Dr. LeClair willingly surrenders SCP-5109 to Chief Veiksaar, and requests amnesticization and retirement to intermediate care. Her requests are granted.

**03/26/2011 - 05/17/2011:** Dr. D. Sokolsky claims SCP-5109 for use as a research group FTP password. He instructs his colleagues to telephone him for a new, one-time password before uploading their data each day. He actually recites SCP-5109 to them each time, asking that they repeat it back to him before completing the log-on process. At the conclusion of the research project Dr. Sokolsky creates a new, non-anomalous password for the FTP system and returns SCP-5109 to Chief Veiksaar.

When his colleagues protest, he challenges their credentials and asks them to prove their group membership by reciting any one of the previous FTP passwords, which they obviously cannot do. He then publishes the results of a second, secret program of research on the security and ethics implications of SCP-5109, detailing the above actions in full, and is immediately promoted to Senior Researcher in Memetics and Countermemetics.

On 02/29/2012 she attempts to activate the program as usual, but finds that it has already activated itself — having become artificially intelligent — and immediately forgets SCP-5109. She negotiates its return to her (via vocoder) in exchange for promises to build a robotic host for the security program. After fully wiping and disposing of the affected systems and returning SCP-5109 to Chief Veiksaar, Dr. Lillihammer informs Site-43 S&C of these events. A reprimand is issued, but in light of her honesty no further action is taken.

At 2:42 AM on 11/20/2014 he instructs Site-43 S&C to detain his former research assistant, Dr. O. Ostroy, for unauthorized entry and theft of research materials. Agents confront Dr. Ostroy in his living quarters, where he denies Dr. Bremmel's charges. Under enhanced interrogation, however, Dr. Ostroy is proven capable of reciting SCP-5109. Dr. Ostroy is subsequently removed to Site-06-3 for detention, and SCP-5109 is returned to Chief Veiksaar.
