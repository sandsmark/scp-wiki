**Preceding Events:** Extranormal Event 3570 (EE-3570) was preceded by a set of related phenomena, listed as follows.

[[collapsible hideLocation="bottom" show="   ▷ Show Timeline" hide="△ Close"]]

||~ Date||~ Occurrence||
||~ May 10, 2018||The Earth's Akiva radiation[[footnote]]**Akiva:** An SI unit used to assign a measurement to esoteric radiation emitted by powerful reality-bending entities. Defined by the value of piety reported among adherents of any such entities.[[/footnote]] level decreases and becomes uniform with the cosmic background constant of ~0.7 milliakiva (mÁ). Despite the expected repercussions, however, the Earth registers only a minuscule decrease in its ambient hume level. As well, one or more Class-IX Entities become undetectable and are considered lost.||
||~ May 11||A dense Avian meme complex (“EOI-121”) spreads throughout the Noosphere[[footnote]]**Noosphere:** The set of ideas, thoughts, or concepts humans are biologically capable of having or conceiving.[[/footnote]] via [[[scp-3662|SCP-3662]]]. This is now understood to be the result of extra-universal interference.

Humans infected by the Avian meme complex are designated Type-BE Humanoid Entities.||
||~ June 5||A correspondence between the Serpent's Hand and the Avian Division occurs. Through this and a series of messages from Project Milliard, the Avian Division determined a Class-VIII Reality-Manipulator had influenced the Noosphere.||
||~ June 24||60% of Type-BE entities in North America begin a mass exile to the Midwestern United States. The assembled entities erect a large ibis-shaped monument, despite lacking fine motor skills or higher intellect. The monument becomes a focal point for thaumic energy generation[[footnote]]MTF-Eta-4 operatives recorded this with a thaumometer, which quantifies thaumic energy levels within a localized area.[[/footnote]] via an as-yet-unknown vector. The Avian Division detects the same thaumic disturbances across the world, suggesting the construction of other monuments.||
||~ August 2||The Avian meme infects 99.9% of the human population. Between 5 and 10% of the worldwide population expires from starvation after the loss of the worldwide agricultural industry. A small percentage of Type-BE entities (10–15% of the population) engage in regular sarcophagy on the larger 85% for sustenance.||
||~ August 8||Lunar Area-32 detects thaumic disturbances across the surface of the Moon.||
||~ August 9||The North American monument radiates a vibrant blue. It is surmised that the other monuments are exhibiting a similar change.||

EE-3570 began shortly thereafter.

**Event Designation:** EE-3570

**Date of Occurrence:** 9 August 2018

**Location:** Worldwide

**Event Description:** At 11:10 a.m. PDT, the Moon emitted an intense blue light associated with large levels of thaumic activity and became visible to the naked eye. At its first zenith, ~1.1 billion Type-BE entities across the easternmost part of Russia, North and South America, and parts of Northwestern Europe became exposed to moonlight.

Exposed entities underwent extensive musculoskeletal transformations and grew wing-like anatomical structures from their backs. Entities experienced a mass enhancement of the deltoid muscles; the dorsal portions of the trapezius and scapula expanded and acquired a wider and more defined morphology. Parallel to the existing arms, a new set of forelimbs emerged laterally. The forelimbs extended outward to a 3-m length on each side of the body, according to an average adult's physiology. Different body types and sizes developed proportional anatomical formations.

The forelimbs developed long, bony digits occurring within a thick and supple membrane that became the basis for a new network of blood vessels. The forelimbs developed feathers, consistent in composition and function to those of common seabirds, and retractable talons at the extremities. Type-BE entities displayed various levels of discomfort during this process, which required between 2 and 5 hr to complete. After the transformation, the newly developed wings allowed for a diversity of short- and long-range flight.

During the Moon's transit, locations across the world became exposed to moonlight and thaumic energy. All exposed Type-BE entities developed the same winged transformations. Newly winged Type-BE entities emitted greater amounts of [[[goc-supplemental-arad|Élan-Vital Energy (EVE)]]],[[footnote]]**//Élan-Vital// Energy:** Fundamental particles generated by all living entities.[[/footnote]] became capable of flight speeds greater than 40 km/h, and in most instances, displayed predatory behaviour.

At 05:45 p.m. PDT, Armed Research Site-18 -- the Avian Division's base of operations -- received a transmission from [[[secure-facility-dossier-lunar-area-32|Lunar Area-32]]]. A transcript is as follows.

This is Junior Researcher Arvo Driessen of Lunar Area-32 transmitting on all Foundation channels. We are on full lockdown. Task Force Sigma-6 “Puddlejumpers” is gone. Multiple anomalous humanoids have entered the facility @@[@@//Static.//@@]@@ engaging in hostilities.

To the Avian Division: Consider Lunar Area-32 lost.

Yesterday, we detected thaumic disturbances across the lunar surface, and a few hours ago, it turned bright blue. It was pretty quiet afterward, but then a group of winged humanoids poured in from [[[scp-120|SCP-120]]] -- our exit out of here. I'm stationed at the research facility in Sub-Level 3, way the hell away from them. Lucky me. @@[@@//Static.//@@]@@ can't say the same for my colleagues. Doctor Simrin and I had been together during the attack before she headed up to containment to check up on the Euclid-Classes. I lost her signal shortly after. It's been three hours.

@@[@@//Pause.//@@]@@

I checked the security video. There were what, thirty of them? When they appeared, they immediately attacked the reception area. One agent took to defending himself with a security baton. He smacked a few of them before they swarmed him, and then the bastards started eating him. They tore his eyes from their sockets, and as he screamed, tore out his tongue next.

I think they're getting restless, being cooped up in here like this? They've taken to chewing up the electrical systems, bringing entire sections of the facility down with them. When one of them collapses from electrocution, the next one just climbs over and continues where they left off. They are literal birdbrains.

@@[@@//Pause.//@@]@@

I don't know what's going on down there, but up here? We're screwed. I think the worst part of all this is the fact that Director Hourdoon, that prick, escaped with the only evac shuttle. Hope that piece of shit crashes and burns.

I'll keep Hoygull updated, but honestly? Don't get your hopes up. The support systems are failing, the sub-levels are practically swarming with those stupid birds, and more of them keep piling in through dash 120.

Good luck saving humanity and all that. As far as I can tell, humanity is beyond saving. If there was any hope before, it's all gone now. My only recommendation is to aim for the head.

The newly transformed Type-BE entities have been observed flying in flocks with upwards of 500 individuals. Hunting occurs on both an individual and group basis, with moderate territorial aggression occurring among rivalling flocks. Entities can unhinge their jaws while consuming prey, enlarging the oral cavity to about three times its size. Skin and tissue stretch with ease, whereas chewing remains unencumbered.

The extent of behaviours these entities display is as-yet-undocumented, because of their relative aggression toward other species of birds (including Avian Division personnel) and insufficient observation time.

++ AUGUST 10 UPDATE

[[/div]]

**I. EE-3570 Status**

About 24 hr have elapsed since the Moon began emitting thaumic energy, and ~90% of all Type-BE entities have been affected. The Earth's thermosphere displays an iridescent atmospheric phenomenon, similar to aurorae, generated by excess thaumic energy.

Affected Type-BE entities surrounding their constructed monuments have begun off-world transit via spontaneously occurring Ways produced by the monuments. Transit occurs on an individual basis, whereas the Ways have spread radially outward according to a geometric expansion model.

The Avian Division estimates that most Type-BE entities will abandon the Earth within one week. --Research into the emergence and destination of these Ways is ongoing.-- [[span class="rev-blue"]]It has been determined that the Ways lead to the exoplanet URA-8047 (see Supplemental Materials for more information).[[/span]]

**II. Follow-Up Actions Taken**

An excerpt from Marine Fighting Team CHARYBDIS' initial response to EE-3570 is as follows.

[[div class="report-box"]]

----
**NOTE:** MFT CHARYBDIS is a cybernetically augmented four-person unit, part of an organization known as the [[[spc-hub|Centre]]].[[footnote]]Centre personnel are primarily dedicated to combatting anomalous nautical threats, typically of Selachian nature. The Department of Extra-Universal Affairs first established contact with the Centre in 2011, but MTF-Eta-4 of the Avian Division and MFT CHARYBDIS of the Centre only began joint operations shortly before the advent of EE-3570.[[/footnote]] Audiovisual footage was gathered from each CHARYBDIS operative and compiled into one abridged transcript.

CHARYBDIS operatives appear unaffected by the anomaly. Whether this is related to their extra-universal origin, a memetic hardening developed during their training, or some other effect is as-yet-unknown.

After the start of the Event, Mobile Task Force Eta-4 (“Begone Thoth”) recommended that CHARYBDIS proceed to Outpost-24-B and remain there until the cessation of the Event. While travelling to Outpost-24-B, an overwhelming force of Type-BE entities engaged CHARYBDIS, forcing the team to abandon operator Leah Řezník (CHARYBDIS-3). Fully transformed Type-BE entities discovered Outpost-24-B about 4 hr later.

**C-4 Haruki:** Sir, they're attempting access to the main entrance. Can't we do something about it? @@[@@//She motions punching actions.//@@]@@

**C-1 Quinn:** Eta-4 told us to keep indoors, C-4. You can do your punching when we figure out what in the Leviathan's asshole is happening. Capisce?

**C-4 Haruki:** See, this is why I should've brought my new drone! I could clobber those Deviants from within the comfort of these air-conditioned walls. @@[@@//She continues motioning punching actions.//@@]@@

**C-2 Jaedan:** Are you sure about us staying put, Quinn? When the birdbrains find a way to burst in here, we'll be packed like sardines. I'd rather be stuck out there than in here, you know.

**C-4 Haruki:** Caught between some birdbrains and a hard-head? I don't know about you, but I embrace death's sweet release.

**C-1 Quinn:** @@[@@//To Eta-4 over comms.//@@]@@ Eta-4, is the Moon still being weird?

**E-4 Lead Keshrayuth (COM):** Affirmative, although... By Medila's grace, it's left your kind unmarred. If only we could test–

**C-1 Quinn:** So, you're saying we're green to engage?

@@[@@//Pause.//@@]@@

**E-4 Lead Keshrayuth (COM):** Yes, but I require your efforts at Site-18 ASAP. The other half of Eta-4 is stationed in the Midwest investigating the monument, so right now, I need all the resources I can get.

**C-1 Quinn:** Roger that, E-4 Leader. @@[@@//To CHARYBDIS.//@@]@@ C-2, C-4, let's link up with C-3 and then get back to base. @@[@@//To C-3 Leah over comms.//@@]@@ C-3, are you there? You're never this quiet. You're usually yammering your mouthpiece off.

**C-3 Leah (COM):** I'm here, Cap. Can't make too much noise, they're close.

**C-1 Quinn:** What's your position?

**C-3 Leah (COM):** Abandoned farmhouse, edge of Wakeford. They're squawking, waiting for me to come out.

**C-1 Quinn:** Hold your position, C-3; we're coming to get you!

**C-3 Leah (COM):** Hurry!

@@[@@//CHARYBDIS exits Outpost-24-B and flies toward Leah's location by use of back-mounted rocket packs within their suits. Multiple Type-BE entities follow.//@@]@@

@@[@@//After a 2-min flight, CHARYBDIS approaches the farmhouse. C-1 Quinn and C-4 Haruki land on the roof and hold position. C-2 Jaedan attempts to dodge a Type-BE instance in mid-flight and crashes through the farmhouse wall.//@@]@@

**C-4 Haruki:** Watch your tail!

@@[@@//Three entities pursue him.//@@]@@

**C-2 Jaedan:** Shit!

@@[@@//Jaedan struggles, lifting debris off his person.//@@]@@

**C-2 Jaedan:** Yeesh, these things reek. @@[@@//To Leah over comms.//@@]@@ Leah, you there? Come out; I don't fuck around with hide-and-seek, you know?

**C-3 Leah:** Right above you, Jae Jae!

@@[@@//Leah dives from the rafters and lands atop an entity. A second entity swipes its talons at her, scratching her suit. She strikes it before a third entity tackles her.//@@]@@

**C-2 Jaedan:** Nobody ever mentions how terrible things will smell after the world ends, do they, Leah?

@@[@@//The second entity screeches while Jaedan combats it. Two more entities enter the farmhouse and engage with Jaedan. Leah wrestles free from the third entity.//@@]@@

**C-3 Leah:** Oh my Thoth, they //do// reek!

**C-2 Jaedan:** Come on, you heard what the bird lady said -- don't invoke the name. That gives him, like, powers or some shit. @@[@@//He dispatches the third entity and kicks it away.//@@]@@ Listen: Between you and me, I don't remember half the things she's told us.

@@[@@//Three more entities enter the farmhouse and attack both Jaedan and Leah.//@@]@@

**C-3 Leah:** What do you want? We have nothing for you! Leave us alone!

**C-1 Quinn (COM):** What in the depths is going on down there? It sounds like an illegal cockfight. C-2, grab C-3 and fly the damn coop!

@@[@@//Leah uppercuts a nearby entity and dispatches it with ease. She turns and connects her fist with another entity's face, which crumples inwards. Five more entities enter.//@@]@@

**C-2 Jaedan:** We punch one and two more swoop in to take its place. You know, I liked it better when we faced Selachians. @@[@@//He pummels an entity, and Leah incapacitates it.//@@]@@ They kept us on our toes, but it felt so good knowing how much of a difference we were making.

**C-3 Leah:** While you reminisce, I'll worry about not getting turned into bird feed, thanks. Let's go!

@@[@@//Leah kicks over a stack of hay bales, and the pair flies through the wall and onto the roof.//@@]@@

@@[@@//A nearby entity follows the pair and perches in a stationary position atop the roof. It folds back its wings while vocalizing a high-pitched chirping sound in Jaedan's direction.//@@]@@

**C-4 Haruki:** Jaedan, I think he likes you!

**C-2 Jaedan:** @@[@@//To the entity.//@@]@@ Okay, hear me out. We can't take you home. That's against protocol. So, either you leave right now, or my boys over here will send you to Kingdom Come. @@[@@//He showcases his arms, flexing.//@@]@@

@@[@@//Leah inspects the entity. It displays feathers with a brown colouration and bears [[[tales-of-the-automaton-the-big-birdocalypse|copious amounts of jewellery]]] that dangle from its neck and arms.//@@]@@

**C-3 Leah:** He doesn't look so scary. What do you think, Cap, can we keep him?

**C-1 Quinn:** At the bottom of a deep dark hole, sure! @@[@@//He laughs.//@@]@@ You know, we haven't actually recovered one of these things yet.

**C-2 Jaedan:** So what? I don't want it!

**C-1 Quinn:** @@[@@//Over comms.//@@]@@ E-4 Lead, we've encountered a non-hostile Type-BE entity. Permission to take it into custody?

**E-4 Lead Keshrayuth (COM):** Very well, but hurry. I'd like to restrict today's operations to //today//. We're still unaware of what implications this anomaly might have at night.

**C-1 Quinn:** You heard the lady. C-2, grab the Deviant. Let's get back to base, team!

The captured instance, designated **EE-3570-A**, is contained within the Anomalous Humanoids Wing of Site-18 and undergoing study.

About 36 hr after the start of the Event, Dr. Hoygull appended Document EE-3570 with a new file.

By the order of the Avian Division, this recording is being transmitted on all Foundation channels.

Before Extranormal Event 3570, the Foundation hypothesized that a massive lunar anomaly would occur in the near future. On the 24th of December 1972, initial analysis of the Apollo 17 Moon landing's geological samples detailed elevated EVE consistent with reality-bending phenomena.[[footnote]]As thaumatic technology was still under-developed before 1972 because of a lack of research into the Theory of Unified Thaumatology, earlier lunar missions could not detect any thaumic energy.[[/footnote]] The samples, collected from various deposits around the Taurus–Littrow Valley landing site, prompted theories of the Moon's thaumic makeup.

In December 1995, the newly christened, and if I might add, unfortunately named “Outpost Thoth-1” performed a series of observations on lunar sites to record thaumic radiation levels. They discovered the Moon had a baseline EVE intensity registering at 141 000 caspers[[footnote]]**Casper:** A unit used to assign a measurement to reality-altering phenomena.[[/footnote]] -- greater than anywhere on Earth.

Why that did not immediately lead to drastic changes in localized reality and sub-reality, is unknown. But, well, that explains why something //did// happen. And you can thank Thoth, the Egyptian god of wisdom, for causing it.

@@[@@//Pause.//@@]@@

In the event that such intense energy might be manipulated against Earth, several active deterrents were devised. The contingencies, unfortunately, could not be enacted because the BE-Class Scenario decimated our workforce.[[footnote]]Dr. Hoygull has decided it would be most appropriate to categorize the two events as the same: Hence, BE-Class “**Migration**” End-of-Consciousness Scenario.[[/footnote]] Taking a look at the files here... Projects included the mass [[[scp-1654|Scranton Reality Anchor “Seraphim Array”]]] in mid-Earth orbit, the Global Hard-Light Energy Shielding System, and the controlled expansion of [[[scp-2821|SCP-2821]]] to quickly consume the Moon and then itself via–

What's this? The file literally reads, “[DATA EXPUNGED]”. Of course, the order and protocols of the Foundation still hold true, even when the world falls apart!

Anyway, the red tape speaks for itself. Let me tell you what we're going to do about this. Appended to Document EE-3570 is Supplemental Materials file [[span class="terminal-span"]]UMBRAL_MIGRATORY_SEQUENCE.txt[[/span]]. Take note of the information within that file before using available resources to reach immediate rendezvous with Mobile Task Force Eta-4. After that, we will co-ordinate off-world evacuation efforts.

Suffice it to say we don't have much time left. Everything will, uh, make sense soon.

And if it doesn't?

Good luck.

**III. Supplemental Materials**

The few remaining Avian Division staff in Egypt discovered a preserved papyrus reed manuscript, circa 1900 BCE, filed within [[[scp-1644|Reliquary Site-62]]] Archives. The manuscript was written in Egyptian hieratic script and included several surviving accounts.

A series of fragmented excerpts, as they relate to EE-3570, are as follows.

[[div class="blockquote"]]
I have not told the Elders, but I received a visit from the Sacred One in my dreams. In fear, I asked the one question that has haunted me most. I asked, //Thoth, why do you cast down unbelievers?//

To which Thoth replied, //such an action is a justice basked in by the righteous.//

To this, I asked, //Thoth, how can you cast down your children, righteous or not?//

Thoth said, //your kind is not truly my children. But I have asserted myself in front of the Communion for those I deem worthy -- thus, those I consider my children in spirit. For if I do not extend my wisdom, why must my wisdom exist?//

I asked Thoth, //is there anything we could do to anger you?//

To which Thoth replied, //to reject my wisdom is to spite me. Indeed, to be without my wisdom for long is a blasphemous offence. But to anger me, truly, it would need the effort of one who is quite mad. There is nothing you, my collective children, could do to anger me. I have plans yet for those that have failed to gain my favour.//

I then asked, //Thoth, what is your plan for us?//

Thoth proclaimed, //I shall cast down the azure fires of Set above, which will consume your Holy City. These are not raging fires, however, but those of majesty and wonder. Of the bright motes that twinkle in the night. Of Ra's destiny. And when the City becomes inflamed, so too will your hearts. They will sprout and flower into vast wings in the reflection of the Sacred Ibis. This, I shall share with all my children, who will join my flock in the vast Cosmos. You will rule my paradise. Forever, forever.//

I awoke, wishing not the fires blue. I enjoy mortality. If Thoth wills transcendence -- I am in fear. Alas, if it means tasting the Brot Kruma, perhaps that is necessary to–
