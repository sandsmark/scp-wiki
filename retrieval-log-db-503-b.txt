[[/div]]

//The following is an audio log recorded during the execution of Operation "Quickdraw".//

//Location is the Playa Club, an apartment building located in the city of [DATA EXPUNGED], where [[[SCP-hargargle]]] was located before being retrieved by SCP personnel.//

//Abbreviations are the following://

//LC: Lambda Control Center.//
 //L1: Agent ████████, Tactical Relay//
 //L2: Dr. ███████, Intellectual support//
//M55: Mobile Task-Force Theta-Five "Spoiled Brats"//
//MD: [DATA EXPUNGED] Mobile operative in charge of SCP retrieval//
//ME: [DATA EXPUNGED] Mobile operative in charge of SCP retrieval//
//MF: [DATA EXPUNGED] Mobile operative in charge of SCP retrieval//
//MG: [DATA EXPUNGED] Mobile operative in charge of SCP retrieval//

MD: This is MD. [static]ached Point Zero-One.

L1: Repeat, MD.

MD: We have reached Point Zero-One.

L1: Copy that, MD. Any threats on sight?

MD: Negative, L1. Area is clear. Besides the bystanders looking at 4 full-armoured guys with Assault Rifles.

L2: Okay guys, listen up. We're dealing with a probably sentient object here. It alters reality on the big blue building you're probably now looking at, fucking shit up in ways that not even Clef's mind can imagine it. We believe it has something to do with the Sphere on the roof, so that's your target.

ME: Why didn't the chopper sent us to the roof and secure it?

L2: See, there's a 15 meter dead zone where all electronic devices die and the SCP starts acting indirectly. We can't really afford knowing that the SCP can act physically in the hard way.

MF: Oh boy.

L2: Anyways, MF has the box. Once you get to the roof, you're going to secure the Sphere and once you do that, notify us with the green flares everybody was equipped with. We'll activate the radio signal that will send the telekill box 30 meters away with the attached thrusters. If something happens to MF or the box gets decomissioned, we're using MG's box, understood?

MF: And by something happening to MF means...

L1: Means you getting killed, you wanker. Now keep your head up and look where you're going.

L2: Okay guys, at around 15 meters away from the building you'll hit a dead zone where no radio comunication will be available. From there, you'll be on your own. Good luck.

MD: Roger that, Lambda Control, heading in to checkpoint Zero-Two.

L1: Received, MD. Operation Quickdraw is now in effect. Good luck.

[No recorded chatter for 31 seconds]

L1: M55, confirm arrival at dead zone.

[Static]

L1: M55, confirm arrival at dead zone.

[Static]

L1: M55, if you're listening, confirm arrival at dead zone.

[Static]

L2: They're there, geez.

L1: I know, just wanted to do a--

MD: LAMBDA CONTROL, TH[static] MD, WE'RE[static]

L1: Repeat, MD, we can't hear shit!

MD: This is MD, we're on floor seventeen, ME is down!

L1: Down? Why?

MF: Some shit cut him to death, fuck if I know!

L2: Everybody, let's calm the fuck down. Your objective REMAINS. Go up and secure the SCP.

MD: Roger that, we're... Oh GOD.

L1: MD, what the fuck?

MD: IT'S THAT MOTHERFUCKING REPTILE! IT'S THAT GODDAMN MOTHERFUCKING REPTILE!

L1: What reptile, MD?

MG: It's--It's, Oh, Jesus fuck I can't remembe--SIX-EIGHTY-TWO, IT'S SIX-EIGHTY-TWO!

L1: Six-Eighty-Two?

L2: What the actual fuck?

L1: Run! Go up, you MUST get to the item!

MF: There is NO up, you wanker!

L1: MD, tell me the status of SCP-682.

MD: It's not moving, but I think it's looking at us.

L2: Hold on, I'm contacting [DATA EXPUNGED] to check this shit.

MF: Oh God what the FUCK is that noise?

MG: LAMBDA, THERE'S A FUCKING RINGING NOISE ALL OVER THE DAMN PLACE!

L1: Speak softer, for fuck's sake, we can't hear it.

[No recorded chatter for 8 seconds]

MF: Okay... The sound stopped. Everything is more calm now, except for that fucking lizard in the middle, horizontal stairs and a door in the-- Aww shit what now?!

L1: MF, calm the fuck down and tell me what's happening.

MG: THE ENTIRE BUILDING IS RUMBLING, GOD DAMM-

[static]

MD: Woah.

MF: What the shit?

L1: Theta-five, what's your status?

MD: We're... Alive. And in the 20th floor.

L2: I just called [DATA EXPUNGED], 682 is contained. What the fuck was that all about?

MD: No idea.

L1: Okay, gentlemen, remember this is being recorded and we have to keep the formalities as much as we can. You have one floor and then the roof. Advance.

L2: At least they made it through the dead zone.

[No recorded chatter for 23 seconds]

MD: Oh, Jesus fuck, not again!

L2: MD, acknowledge situation.

MF: We're hovering mid-air and the entire floor is fucking spinning, Acknowledged?

L2: ...Acknowledged, god dammit. Just try to fucking move!

MF: Fuck! Lambda, we're now in one of the apartments, but everything seems fucked up here.

L2: That must be one of the SCP's reconfigurations. Try to get out.

MD: Yeah, besides the fact that the door is on the goddamn roof.

L1: Squad, open the fucking door already.

MD: Okay, geez. God, this is so fucked up...

L2: MD, what do you see?

MD: The furniture is like made out of chrome... and everything is out of place. The floor is a gigantic mirror and there's table lamps attached to the walls... Okay, MG found a way to the door.

L2: I don't like where this is going...

MG: Okay, I'm opening the door and OH MY GOD WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT THINNNNNNNNNNNN[Sound distorted, akin to digital corruption]

MD: Shit shit shit! [Heavy gunfire]

L1: Squad, report, what the fuck is going on in there?!

MD: A fucking bug came out of the door, god-fucking-dammiiiiiiit! [heavy gunfire, followed by explosion]

[static]

L1: Fucking... Squad, report in.

MF: The bug is... dead. Fucker disappeared when I activated my 'nade launcher.

L1: Is the door open?

MD: Affirmative, I'm going to-- My GOD.

L2: What?

MF: Behind the door there's... A black... vortex... of some sort. And... Shit. I can see MG's helmet floating in the vortex. Wait, it's his goddamn he- [Cracking noise]

MD: Oh, shit!

L1: What's going on?

MD: The mirror floor is cracking! FU[Screaming followed by static]

L2: SHIT! Squad, report!

[static]

L2: God dammit, not now, Squad, report inmediatly.

[static]

L1: [Sigh] Operation failed, squad terminated by effect of SC-

MD: We're alive, you clot.

L2: Thank goodness. Where are you?

MD: We fell from floor twenty and we ended up in the roof. I just don't fucking get it anymore.

L1: What do you see?

MF: Shit looks like a square... It's definitely the roof because I can see the sky, but it looks like if we're on the eye of a hurricane...

L2: I got confirmation of you in the roof.

L1: Do you see the SCP?

MD: Affirmative, it's on the center, over a stone pillar. It's a clear sphere. We're approaching it.

L1: Careful, guys.

MF: Lambda, we reached the SCP. Item is of about ten centimeters in diameter. Looks like made out of glass. Proceeding to contain in the lockbox...

L2: I just hope the thing works.

MD: Lambda, SCP secured inside the lockbox, activating thrust-- What the FUCK NOW?!

L1: What is it?!

L2: I'm receiving seismic data from the building. This one's for real.

MF: THE ENTIRE THING IS FUCKING SHAKING OH GO-

//[At this point transmission is terminated. The thrusters of the lockbox was activated on time before the Playa Club apartment building collapsed with unknown reason, although it's likely that the removal of SCP-503 was related. Item contained by personnel. The bodies of MD and MF were found with severe trauma caused by the collapse, and the body of ME was also found although with slash trauma not consistent with the collapse. MG is not found, current status unknown, presumed KIA.]//
