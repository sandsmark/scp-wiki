**Description:** SCP-5898-EX is a male human. Documents found near SCP-5898-EX at the time of its discovery indicate its birth name is Ernest Whittaker, born July of 1960 in the North Kansas City Hospital. It should be noted that no copies of these documents have been located in the hospital, state, or national archives. Additionally, no relatives of SCP-5898-EX, living or dead, have been found. Investigations into SCP-5898-EX's personal life prior to its discovery in 2019 have yielded inconclusive results, although this may be due to its reclusive lifestyle as an agricultural worker.

All testing conducted on SCP-5898-EX[[footnote]] Including hume and thaumaturgic/essokinetic capability tests. It should be noted that SCP-5898-EX scored slightly higher than baseline on the Cross-Dimensional Residual Energy test, although not high enough to warrant significant attention.  [[/footnote]] has revealed it to be physically and biologically non-anomalous. However, a series of --potentially-- anomalous events have occurred in close proximity to SCP-5898-EX since its initial discovery. As such, SCP-5898-EX was allowed limited freedoms under close supervision of its residence until the extent of its anomalous properties could be ascertained.

Following Incident-5898-B, SCP-5898-EX has been reclassified as Thaumiel. Refer to **Addendum 5898.6** for further details.

> **Foreward:** On 12/8/2019, SCP-5898-EX entered the Foundation front company "Smith & Charles Produce", 20 miles North of Kansas City. SCP-5898-EX then briefly spoke with Agents Langston and Kazinsky, who were present at the location, before being detained and transported to Site-91.

> **SCP-5898-EX:** Hey fellas, my name is Ernest, Ernest Whittaker. I live, maybe a half hour's drive up the road from here. I came by last week, but y'all were closed.
> 
> **Kazinsky:** That's uh... great, sir. Need help finding anything?
> 
> **SCP-5898-EX:** Naw, just wanted to let you guys know that I'm goin' be busy with some potentially dangerous Corn for a couple weeks, and I suggest steerin' clear of my property for a lil' bit.
> 
> **Langston:** //[Laughs]// I'll make a note of it, sir. 
> 
> **SCP-5898-EX:** Oh, this is a serious matter, fella. This Corn could kill someone if I mess up, yessir. Seen it happen before. Hell, I was gonna stop by the police later. See if they can set up some kind of a perimeter or something. 
> 
> **Langston:** What... exactly do you mean by "corn"? 
> 
> **SCP-5898-EX:** A ghastly thing, sure is. Seen it take down a whole town in a matter of hours before. Even seen a bunch of government agents show up all Men-in-Black style one year when the Corn was 'specially bad.

> **Afterword:** SCP-5898-EX complied with Agent Kazinsky's requests, and is detained for fifteen minutes, at which point additional agents arrive from Site-91. SCP-5898-EX is then transported to Site-91 for preliminary questioning. Agents searching the vehicle owned by SCP-5898-EX discovered several items of interest, including a birth certificate, photographs of possible relatives, and several dozen photographs, illustrations, and scientific papers of corn. Additionally, several partially damaged cobs of corn were found in the trunk. While analysis of the corn did not suggest a known cause for the damage, consumption was ruled out.

> //[SCP-5898-EX shifts in its seat.]//
> 
> **SCP-5898-EX:** Oh, right. I don't want to bore you with a lecture, but me and this corn have a long history. Ever since I was a boy, I've been workin' with the plants. My father taught me how to farm. Showed me how to plant 'em, taught me patience, told me not to rush 'em, that they'd grow better that way. 
> 
> **SCP-5898-EX:** Worked great until he passed away. Since then, the Corn ain't been what it used to. 'Stead of farmin' the corn, sometimes it feels like it's farmin' me.

> **Penot:** What exactly is so special about this corn?
> 
>  **SCP-5898-EX:** Biggest damn nuisance on the planet. Keeps me from livin' a normal life. Every year, I gotta come up with some new rigamarole, some new ritual to make it happy. Else it takes over.

> **Penot:** And what happens then?
> 
> **SCP-5898-EX:** Well then I gotta go somewhere else. The Corn always seems to follow, though.
> 
> **Penot:** Do you have any samples of this corn for us to look at?
> 
> **SCP-5898-EX:** Not yet, no. They'll come up later in the year. Oh, and if the Corn isn't dealt with by me and me alone, things tend to go south real fast. That's what happened last year anyways.

> **Afterword:** SCP-5898 attempted to leave the interview room. After finding it locked, it became increasingly agitated, at which point security was called. SCP-5898-EX was then restrained and moved to a temporary holding cell. SCP-5898-EX did not provide additional useful information following its relocation.
> 
> A team was dispatched from Site-91 to SCP-5898-EX's residence, an ~150-acre farmhouse. The property was searched, but no abnormalities were detected. Several stalks of corn were found emerging from the ground approximately 50 meters from the property's front entrance, but testing confirmed them to be non-anomalous.

> SCP-5898-EX was held at Site-91 for twenty-four hours while the property was monitored. After no additional abnormalities developed, SCP-5898-EX was allowed to return to its residence.

> **Note From the Department of Containment**
> 
> //Due to Ernest Whittaker's knowledge of a potential anomaly, he would usually be required to undergo standard interrogation and given an appropriate amnestic before being released somewhere far away from here. However, due to his inability to provide concrete information on his situation, the Department of Containment has decided to refrain from typical protocol at this time.//
> 
> //Mr. Whittaker will be tentatively designated as SCP-5898-EX until an actual anomaly can be confirmed. He will be equipped with a tracking device and monitored closely via hidden cameras located in and around his residence by Site-91 staff, and allowed to undergo his normal daily routine. Should concrete evidence of an anomaly emerge, further action will be taken. Thank you for your understanding.//

> On 11/09/2019, all camera feed of SCP-5898's residence, both inside and outside, were reported to have undergone technical issues.
>

The following is a timeline of notable events in relation to SCP-5898-EX following Incident-5898-A and the subsequent construction of Barn-001. 


||~ Event Date ||~ Event Description ||~ Additional Notes ||
|| 13/11/2019 || SCP-5898-EX observed spending 48 consecutive hours outside its residence watching a sprouting corn stalk. SCP-5898-EX occasionally made short trips into its home for food and water. After SCP-5898-EX returned to its residence, the corn stalk was analyzed and found to be severely dehydrated, but otherwise normal.  || //How the hell did this guy go for two straight days with nothing but some canned vegetables and sink water? Not to mention no sleep either? Notify me immediately if he does this again.// - Lead Researcher Penot ||
|| 24/11/2019 || SCP-5898-EX reported leaving its residence and driving to a local //Farm & Home Supply// store. As staff prepared to intervene, a handwritten note was discovered on the exterior of Barn-001 reading: "Be back soon. Need to pick up weedkiller." Staff were instructed to observe SCP-5898-EX's behavior from a distance, but not to intervene unless necessary. SCP-5898-EX purchased one container of //Roundup Weed and Grass Killer Concentrate Plus// before returning to its residence. || //For the record, we've never specified the location of Barn-001 to the subject. It's possible he could have seen one of our personnel entering or leaving the station during shift rotations, but I'm going to lean on the side of caution for now. New security measures are now in the works.// - LR Penot||
|| 03/01/2020 || SCP-5898-EX observed tampering with a hidden camera facing the front door of SCP-5898-EX's residence. All four on-duty security personnel were mobilized to halt SCP-5898-EX's behavior[[footnote]] SCP-5898-EX claimed to be doing so out of curiosity, stating it "thought the little thing was neat." [[/footnote]]. Upon returning to Barn-001, security personnel noticed severe corn growths had manifested in and around the structure. || //This confirms the presence of an anomaly. I'm issuing an official statement to the DoC[[footnote]] Department of Containment, specifically Alfredo Regio. [[/footnote]] in Site-91 for SCP-5898-EX's reclassification and containment plan revision. Additionally, I'm ordering the construction of Barn-002, as Barn-001 is unusable in its current state.// - LR Penot||
|| 13/01/2020 || SCP-5898-EX attempted to enter Barn-002 but was halted by security staff before it could enter the building. Upon questioning its intentions, SCP-5898-EX insisted that "the Corn's gonna get rough soon," and that "the thing with the barn's just the start." SCP-5898-EX could not provide additional details and was subsequently returned to its residence. || //I'm issuing a reminder to all staff that Barn-002 should not be left unattended at any point, in case SCP-5898-EX's right and we'll be seeing an increase in corn growth in the coming weeks.// - LR Penot||
|| 15/01/2020 || Sharp increase in corn growth detected over the course of several days. SCP-5898-EX observed yelling hysterics at large patches of corn. In such patches, growth was observed to slow for a period of time.  || //After several agents reported getting lost in "corn mazes" I'm recommending heightened caution when leaving Barn-002.// - LR Penot ||
|| 29/01/2020 || After several days of no activity, SCP-5898-EX was observed exiting its premises wielding an improvised flamethrower. It then proceeded to burn various areas of dense corn growth before it was detained by security personnel. SCP-5898-EX was then held in Barn-002, awaiting transfer to Site-91 for violating the terms of its freedom[[footnote]] Specifically by being in possession of a weapon without the prior knowledge of security staff. [[/footnote]]. || //SCP-5898-EX's residence was thoroughly searched following this incident. I take full responsibility for our ignorance of SCP-5898-EX's activities.// - LR Penot. ||
|| 29/01/2020 || Several minutes after SCP-5898-EX was placed en route to Site-91, an abnormally large cob of corn sprouted from within Barn-002, resulting in the structure's collapse. Several additional cobs of corn manifested in and around SCP-5898-EX's residence. || //Containment Specialist here. Ordering the immediate return of SCP-5898-EX to its residence and the dispatch of burn crews to deal with the corn growth. Further instructions are being sent to all SCP-5898-EX staff.// - Containment Specialist Drew Langly ||

> **Foreward:** SCP-5898-EX was interviewed following the sharp increase in the anomalous activity around its residence. This interview was held in hopes of identifying a way to counteract or otherwise limit the spread of the anomalous plant growth. Due to the short timeframe of the situation, the interview was held in a vehicle en route to SCP-5898-EX's residence.

> 
> = **[End Log]**
> 
> ------
> 
> **Afterword:** SCP-5898-EX arrived at its residence along with a containment crew armed with standard-issue flamethrowers. Although available firepower would be sufficient to control non-anomalous plant growth, the containment crew was unable to deal significant damage to the corn due to its alarming rate of regrowth. Containment Specialist Langly delivered an emergency notice to Site-91, and additional resources were dispatched. SCP-5898-EX failed to provide useful knowledge to combat the plant growth during the incident.

Things would have gone poorly if it weren't for the appearance of an additional anomaly, which spontaneously manifested during the incident and automatically began neutralizing instances of anomalously altered plant matter. The object has since been contained and designated as SCP-5898-PRIME. Despite SCP-5898-PRIME's effectivity in eliminating said plant life, trace amounts of similar growths have been detected across the greater Kansas City area. As such, I am designating the anomalous corn growth as SCP-████. Containment procedures have been altered accordingly. As for SCP-5898-EX proper, we found no trace of it at the location of the incident. Until SCP-5898-EX can be located, it is to be listed MIA. If it's out there, we'll find it.//
