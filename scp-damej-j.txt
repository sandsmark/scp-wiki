**Item #:** SCP-damej-J

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-damej-J is to be contained in a soundproof cell outside of Site-19, pointed away from the building. In the event that SCP-damej-J starts firing towards Site-19, it is to be spun around so it is once again firing away. Personnel are required to wear level 7A ear protection while communicating with SCP-damej-J, as well as during testing.

**Description:** SCP-damej-J is a robotic automaton constructed out of wood and small pieces of twine. On its back is a sticker reader "tranfomr: robit is desguse, by researcher james age 10[[footnote]]Any connections to the currently AWOL Researcher James who left the Foundation at age 8 after stealing many dangerous SCPs to form the "kA0s insuRgnc3e" are currently tenuous at best.[[/footnote]]".

Unfortunately, despite its significant state of disrepair, SCP-damej-J is still able to function as originally designed; that is, it is able to shoot bullets and talk. Testing has shown that SCP-damej-J hurts to listen to and look at to an unusual degree.
