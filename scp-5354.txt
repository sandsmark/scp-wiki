**Item #:** SCP-5354

**Object Class:** --Safe-- Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** As of November 2018, SCP-5354 remains closed to the public. Regular updates are to be released regarding the instability of the area and social media is to be monitored for new mentions of SCP-5354. A boundary fence is in place around the site, warning signs are situated on associated footpaths and an on-foot patrol is in place to prevent further civilian incidents.

[[collapsible show="Show Archived Containment Procedures" hide="Please note: The archived containment procedures shown below are for reference purposes only."]]
**[Updated on 12/11/2018]** SCP-5354 is to be remotely monitored for increases in civilian activity or changes to individual visiting patterns. Should civilians attempt to inhabit the site, they are to be dispersed and peacefully discouraged from returning. Use of amnestics has been authorised as necessary.

Given the low-risk nature of SCP-5354, and to avoid drawing unnecessary attention to the site, a physical perimeter boundary is not to be established. [[footnote]]Subject to regular review.[[/footnote]]
[[/collapsible]]

**Description:** SCP-5354 is the site of Caer Bran Hill Fort on the Penwith Peninsula in Cornwall. Any individual who crosses the outer boundary[[footnote]]As delineated by the Iron Age rampart and ditch.[[/footnote]] will become unable to experience anger, sadness, or produce tears. This effect continues until the affected individual exits SCP-5354.

Given SCP-5354's folkloric reputation as a refuge from evil spirits, it is likely that these anomalous effects have been active for several centuries.

**Addendum 1: SCP-5354 Initial Incident Report** 

On 7th January 2016, West Cornwall emergency services received a call from a Mrs. Temple-Stewart requesting assistance for a young, non-responsive female at SCP-5354. This female was later identified as Ms. Anna Worthing. Complaints previously lodged with the local council[[footnote]]Including one made by Mrs. Temple-Stewart.[[/footnote]] indicate that Ms. Worthing had been residing at SCP-5354 for several months.

//[Ms. Worthing's eyes are closed. She wraps her arms around her body, then lowers her chin towards her chest.]//

**Dr. Young:** Ms. Worthing, we'd like to ask you a few questions about -

**Ms. Worthing:** And then you'll let me go back?

**Dr. Young:** We won't stop you.

//[Ms. Worthing inhales, then exhales slowly. She nods.]//

**Dr. Young:** Okay. Can you tell us why you've been camping on the Peninsula? Did something happen to - 

//[Ms. Worthing raises her head.]//

**Ms. Worthing:** What's wrong with me. That's what you really want to ask, isn't it? What kind of fuckup drops everything to go and camp out in the middle of nowhere? What kind of fucking - 

**Dr. Young:** No, we just - 

**Ms. Worthing:** You wouldn't get it even if I told you. Someone like //you// could never understand what it's like to be such a fuck-up that even your parents can't stand the sight of you. I - I just want to be left alone. By you. By them. By -

//[Ms. Worthing pauses for a moment. When she speaks again, her voice is quieter.]//

We had a fight that day - my Dad and me. I'd had another shitty day at work, and... It's like he can never leave it alone. //"Why can't you work in the bank like Carol's boy? You're never going to get your own place."// Before I even took my shoes off, he's at me about how I'm ruining their retirement, and I - I couldn't stay there. I //couldn't//. I just needed to get away for a while, okay? I needed a break from his bullshit. From all of it. It's too much to - 

//[Ms. Worthing pauses and presses both hands to her face. When she removes her hands, her cheeks are wet.]//

Everyone says the view from the Caer is special. On a clear day, you can see for miles. The world looks... better. I just went up there to clear my head. Standing there, watching the way the ocean moved. I felt... light. I could sit looking out to sea for hours and not worry about a thing.

It was one night, at first. Just a break from all the yelling and judgement. The being compared to other people's kids. Never being good enough. One night and then... I don't know. The longer I stayed, the less I had to go back to. And the less I //wanted// to go back to it. My phone got cut off. I guess I lost my job, and -

Please. I don't want to be here. I can't deal with - 

**Dr. Young:** Thank you, Ms. Worthing.

**Addendum 2: SCP-5354 Incident 2**

Between May and September 2018, on-site team members reported a gradual increase in both overall civilian site traffic and mid-length[[footnote]]Defined for recording purposes as visits lasting between two and twenty-four hours.[[/footnote]] visits. A review of containment procedures was brought forward to early October, but given the typical seasonal fluctuations in visit patterns, it was decided that no immediate action was required. 

On October 28th, SCP-5354 was visited by self-proclaimed wellness coach Maxwell Finch. Mr. Finch reportedly remained at the site for three hours, taking multiple photos before ultimately returning to his vehicle. 

At 09.38 on October 29th, an image of SCP-5354 was posted to Mr. Finch's Instagram page with the caption //"I found tranquility here in Caer Bran - you too can rediscover yourself by welcoming nature into your life!"// and a link to Mr. Finch's website. The image quickly amassed several thousand likes and comments from Mr. Finch's followers.

Over the course of the next week, SCP-5354 experienced an exponential increase in foot traffic, culminating in an attempt to establish a small on-site camp on the weekend of November 10-11th. Footpaths leading to the site sustained significant damage and car parks along a five-mile stretch of the peninsula were reported to be overflowing. On-site teams quickly acted to clear and close the site. Warnings were posted both along the trail and in local media claiming that subsidence associated with the underlying archaeology had made the area unsafe. A patrol was established to turn away new visitors, and any individuals who continued to seek access to the site were administered amnestics.
