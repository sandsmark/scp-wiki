**Item #:** SCP-1147

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** All specimens of SCP-1147 are to be stored in separate planters in a 10m x 30m x 5m greenhouse located above ground on the premises of Sector 28. 3 liters of water should be added to each planter every 7 days.

Any instances of SCP-1147-1 produced by the specimens should be stored in the opaque container next to each planter. Personnel working in greenhouse are to be screened upon exit to prevent accidental dispersal of SCP-1147-1. Following test SCP-1147-DC all handling of SCP-1147-1 must be done with approved tools.

Testing the safety and edibility of any specimen of SCP-1147-2 is restricted to D-Class personnel. --After 48 hours of observation specimens may be cleared for general consumption.--

All tests must be approved by Dr. Laurel.

**Description:** SCP-1147 is an unclassified species of plum tree whose seeds, designated SCP-1147-1, can be planted in practically any substance. The resulting plant will adopt physical attributes from the utilized substance. SCP-1147 has proven capable of growing in solids, loose material, and liquids via hydroponics. SCP-1147 produces fruit, designated SCP-1147-2.

The original specimen of SCP-1147 was discovered growing from the steel base of a lamp post in ████ ██████, Georgia, where it was believed to be an art installation by the local population.

**SCP-1147 Control**
**Substance:** Standard potting soil.
**Result:** Normal plum tree closely matching similar species. Seeds retain anomalous properties.
**Fruit:** Sweeter than expected.
**Notes:** //To eliminate as many variables as possible, only seeds from SCP-1147 control should be used for new tests. -Dr. Laurel// 

**SCP-1147-ST**
**Substance:** 20cm cube of galvanized steel. 5cm hole drilled into top, seed placed within, plugged with steel shavings.
**Result:** Trunk is high quality steel with a superior tensile strength. Leaves and flowers are thin, rigid zinc sheets and give off no scent.
**Fruit:** Inedible. D-182 cracked tooth in attempt. Subsequent taste tests denied for specimens that can't be cut with a knife.
**Notes:** //This is the same material in which SCP-1147 was discovered. Original specimen successfully reproduced. -Dr. Laurel//

**SCP-1147-CO**
**Substance:** Planter filled with poured concrete. Seed pressed 5cm under surface.
**Result:** Trunk matches color, texture, and strength of concrete. Leaves are pliable. When soaked in water and applied to a surface they harden into a firm shell. Flowers share similar properties and have a chalky scent.
**Fruit:** Inedible.
**Notes:** //Leaves could be useful to quickly repair damaged walls/floors. Further research recommended. -Dr. Laurel//

**SCP-1147-CH**
**Substance:** Charcoal ground into rough powder.
**Result:** Trunk dry and cracked, resembling a tree after a forest fire. Leaves black and crumble easily. Flowers smell like burnt wood. Recommend storing away from other specimens in case of accidental combustion.
**Fruit:** Withered and smoky flavored. Produces a small quantity of liquid which is easily ignited.

**SCP-1147-SC**
**Substance:** Table salt.
**Result:** Entire tree is off-white in color. Trunk is very dry and brittle, with bark consisting of what appear to be oversized salt crystals. Leaves and flowers are brittle, translucent, and cubic in shape. All parts of the specimen quickly dissolve in water.

Leaves resemble those of the cannabis genus of plants. Flowers are white, with petals that naturally twist into short, stumpy rolls with blunted tips.
**Fruit:** Technically edible, though chemicals in the fruit cause a distorted perception of space and time, mental and physical sedation, and increased appetite.
**Notes:** //Anyone caught using any specimens of SCP-1147-MJ for "recreational" use will be demoted to D-Class, no exceptions. -Dr. ███████//

**Result:** Tree easily mistaken for a natural plant at a distance, but subtle sheen and stiffness of leaves noticeable upon closer inspection. Vulnerable to deformation at higher temperatures.
**Fruit:** Edible, with a soft plum flavor, but no nutritional value. With wick inserted, fruit will burn for approximately 12 hours. 

**SCP-1147-RU**
**Substance:** 20cm cube of Polybutadiene rubber.

[[collapsible show="Animalia Test Log" hide="Close Animalia Test Log"]]
**Note:** All specimens in this category raised in isolated underground testing chambers at Sector ██. Access restricted to Security Level 3.

**SCP-1147-HB**
**Substance:** 1 Langstroth-type artificial beehive, occupied by common honeybees.
**Result:** Tree is stout with a yellowish-brown bark that is waxy to the touch. The trunk itself contains hundreds of small, hexagonal cells similar to that of honeycomb, which the local bees have quickly taken advantage of, storing food and eggs inside the cells. Branches are a darker color, and contain fewer cells. Leaves are a hexagonal shape with rounded corners. Flowers are bright yellow with black marks and emit a strong, sweet smell not unlike that of honey, though the bees show no interest in them. 
**Fruit:** Dark yellow with a honeycomb-like texture. When the first specimen was bitten into by a test subject, the fruit was discovered to be filled with bees. Test subject was quickly treated for anaphylactic shock. After removing the bees, the fruit was found to be sweet and sticky to the touch.

**SCP-1147-BL**
**Substance:** 30 liters cow's blood.
**Result:** Bark is flaky, with a dark color reminiscent of dried blood. Leaves are thin and translucent, featuring a web of red veins. Flowers are a dark crimson and emit a red mist once a day. Specimens should be tended and watered only by D-Class wearing environmental suits until the nature of Researcher Parker's illness can be determined. 
**Fruit:** Resembles a regular plum with a nearly black skin and dark red juices. D-968 and D-2401 vomited and convulsed within 1 hour of ingesting an entire sample. Further testing suspended.

**SCP-1147-BO**
**Substance:** Complete cow skeleton, ground into powder.
**Result:** Trunk is smooth and white, with a core of marrow. Produces no leaves, flowers or fruit.
**Fruit:** None.

**SCP-1147-ME**
**Substance:** Ground beef.
**Result:** Bark resembles cow flesh, complete with thin layer of mottled hair, covering striated muscle. Produces hair in place of leaves. Flowers bud as fleshy sacs before ripening into fruit. Scent is rotten and disorienting.
**Fruit:** Raw ingestion produced symptoms reminiscent of food poisoning. Cooked fruit more edible but taste described as "gross" and "wrong."

**SCP-1147-DC**
**Substance:** Seed implanted under the forearm skin of restrained D-Class subject.
**Result:** Growth resembled an additional limb, with roots entangled in the veins, nerves and bones of the arm. D-1052 reported no ill effects and responded to stimulus given to SCP-1147-DC. After surgical removal both specimen and D-1052 expired on the operating table, autopsy pending.
**Fruit:** [REDACTED] All samples of SCP-1147-DC-1 and SCP-1147-DC-2 destroyed.
**Notes:** //Further testing requires O5 level approval. -Dr. Laurel//

**SCP-1147-BR**
**Substance:** Complete human brain from D-1398.
**Result:** Bark is pale and membranous, with dark veins visible beneath the surface. Specimen responds to harmful stimulus by shifting away at a rate of 1cm/min. Leaves laced with a dense web of veins and nerves. Flowers resemble primitive sensory organs, sensitivity tests ongoing.
**Fruit:** Upon attempted removal of fruit [DATA EXPUNGED]. Agents ██████████ and █████ from MTF Theta-4 responded and specimen now under control and observation. Requesting all available records pertaining to D-1398.
**Notes:** //Further testing requires O5-█ approval. Not that it'll do Researcher Paulsen any good. I accept full responsibility for not taking his suspicions more seriously. Dammit. I went into botany to avoid this sort of thing. -Dr. Laurel//
