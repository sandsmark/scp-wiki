title:Shuffle Tick Tick
Every night lately, I have the same dream.  I'm in this dark tunnel, and I hear this noise behind me.  It's quiet, distant....faint.  It always draws closer though.  //Shuffle tick tick.  Shuffle Tick Tick//.  It doesn't sound frightening, but I'm compelled to run from it as fast as possible.  The tunnel echos, and I hear it getting closer...then I wake up.

It's bright out this morning.  I smile, and stretch, nothing special.  I make breakfast for my son and myself, put on my suit, head to work.  Lunch was good today for once; burger, fries, shakes in the cafeteria.  It was great, and I looked forward to picking up my son from school, having a quiet night in front of the tube or something.  I turn off my computer, and walk out of the office.  I hear a sound behind me though...//Shuffle Tick Tick.  Shuffle Tick.  Shuffle Tick.//  I turn around quickly, and see a blinking street light, making some popping noises.  I guess it was only my imagination.

I pick up Stephen, and take him home, making dinner.  Chicken, with broccoli spears, and rice.  Delicious!  I put Stephen to bed after watching the Raiders get thoroughly wrecked by the Steelers, and crawl into bed myself.

I'm in a dark tunnel, and all I can hear behind me is //Shuffle Tick Tick.  Shuffle Tick Tick.// But now...a new noise.  A throaty growl, almost animal sounding.  I break out into a run, and after falling on my face, I hear the source of the noise crash down on top of me and I wake up in a cold sweat.  I look around the room, and see nothing out of the ordinary.  I go downstairs, and get a cup of coffee.  It's just nerves right?  Big meeting, nothing out of the ordinary.

As the sun rises, I quickly push Stephen to get into his uniform for school, and get into my car to go to work.  I hear from behind me...//Shuffle Tick Tick.  Shuffle Tick Tick.//  I turn around, frantically searching for the sound.  I see a kid carrying a trash bag, alternating dragging it, and letting it touch the ground.  I breathe a sigh of relief.  I'm not crazy...just overworked, nothing to worry about.

I drive to work quickly, trying to avoid everything and everyone.  I get into the office, and hold my head in my eyes.  I hear a quiet shuffle, and look up, realizing its just the door opening. My secretary asks if everything is alright, and I quickly answer yes.  Work thankfully is uneventfull, and I head back home.  Stephen is at a friend's house I think...I can't remember.  I stay up as long as I can, but eventually head upstairs to my room, laying down, and drifting off to sleep.

I'm in a dark tunnel, a loud noise is coming from behind me //Shuffle Tick Tick//, and something is calling out in the most ghastly voice I can imagine, something unintelligible.   I run as fast as my legs will take me, until finally, I fall to the ground, tripping over an errant rock.  Something pounces on top of me, and grabs my foot between powerful jaws.  All I hear next is a snap, and a tear, as my body goes into shock.  The giant thing jumps on top of me, and grabs me by the throat.  I wake up with a jolt, to see blood all over the bed.  My foot is gone, my throat is raw, and torn.  I stand up in a panic as best I can on the nub of bone left of my left leg, and run through my bedroom door...but it looks...different.  I didn't have time to stop and admire the woodwork though, and I run through the inky blackness into a dark...tunnel?

I move as fast as I can down the dark metal tunnel, towards a sound in front of me, but the only sound that comes out of my mouth is a horrible moan from my mangled throat.  My feet make an odd sound...a shuffle of one foot...a tick, tick as the bone touches the floor.  I try to call for help, but I already know what's happening...


The bored scientists look up at the screaming man in the bed.  "D-344 has broken down into total psychosis.  Note it, and bring in the other D-class marked for 845 imprinting.  Then terminate the subject."  In the corner, a rather old clock with a stuck second hand makes a shuffle sound, as the second hand scrapes against the top of the face, then two quick ticks as it catches up with the correct time...

//Shuffle Tick Tick...//
