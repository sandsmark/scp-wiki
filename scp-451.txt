**Item #:** SCP-451

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to SCP-451's nature, containment is difficult. He has been seen picking locks, using weapons and brute force, and occasionally simply passing through some barriers. Presently, SCP-451 has chosen to remain at Site 19. A security detail of two guards must accompany SCP-451 at all times in order to prevent attempts to access or release other potentially dangerous SCPs. Any research into SCP-451 should be restricted to finding ways to contain, terminate, or communicate with him.

**Description:** SCP-451, formerly Agent M█████ J████, is a Caucasian male, 33 years of age and 1.6m tall. SCP-451 can not perceive the presence or actions of other human beings. Changes made to the immediate environment are generally not noted by SCP-451 unless his attention is elsewhere for any arbitrary period of time. Certain changes to SCP-451's surroundings are ignored, including all attempts to communicate with him and any clear evidence of direct human intervention. This suggests that SCP-451's perceptions are being directly manipulated by an unknown sapient entity.

SCP-451 appeared at Site 19, one month after he was declared MIA, following a failed attempt to retreive a dangerous artifact. The actions of SCP-451 were found to be consistent with stress responses indicated in Agent J████'s psychological profile. Reports of thefts and ghost sightings between the artifact's location and Site 19 suggest that SCP-451 travelled here on foot, taking what resources were at hand. The artifact itself remains at large.

**Addendum 451-1:** SCP-451 has recently become suicidal. He has begun accessing dangerous SCPs in the hope that they will kill him. At present, all of his attempts have failed. Site staff are encouraged to provide SCP-451 with more conventional methods of self-termination.

**Addendum 451-2:** Due to events detailed in Incident Report 451-1, staff are now forbidden from allowing SCP-451 to access any projectile weapons.

**Incident 451-1:** On 07/07/20██, SCP-451 found a firearm left for him by Site 19 staff. SCP-451 entered the main break room, placed the weapon in his mouth, and fired it. The bullet passed through SCP-451 without harming him and entered a Level 2 researcher. The researcher was briefly able to interact with SCP-451 before expiring. Unfortunately, no useful information was passed on to SCP-451.
