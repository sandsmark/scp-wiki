**Item #:** SCP-1293

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** All known specimens of SCP-1293 are to reside within a standard Containment Habitat at Bio-Site 59. Specimens of SCP-1293-F are to be engaged in Procedure 722-Ephraim once per month to avoid the production of SCP-1293-K. A minimum of fifteen (15) armed security personnel must be present within the habitat at all times to neutralize specimens of SCP-1293-K in the event that one is produced. Completed specimens of SCP-1293-A1 are to be photographed before consumption by SCP-1293-F. Personnel present within the habitat are not to attempt communication or physical interaction with specimens of SCP-1293-M during a Terpsichore Event.

**Description:** SCP-1293 is a species of humanoid creatures of unknown origin. Each specimen of SCP-1293 is unique in appearance, although all specimens generally resemble costumed human beings. Autopsies performed on deceased specimens have shown that SCP-1293 are completely unclothed, with skin, bone, and muscle tissue mimicking various types of fabric. SCP-1293 possess biological components resembling a human circulatory system, except the system carries and distributes multicolored balls of sugar instead of blood. SCP-1293 have no apparent nervous systems or digestive tracts, and do not require food, drink, or sleep.  SCP-1293 possess no visible reproductive organs; however, only 54% of SCP-1293 specimens are capable of reproduction. For the purpose of this document, such specimens will be considered female and referred to as SCP-1293-F, whereas non-reproducing specimens will be referred to as SCP-1293-M.

SCP-1293-F vocally communicate in American English, speaking with masculine voices in a cheerful manner. Capable of reproduction, SCP-1293-F gestate their young for a period of roughly nine (9) months before giving birth to another specimen of SCP-1293. Newborn SCP-1293 emerge from their mothers fully matured in size and intelligence. SCP-1293-F deliver their young via their mouths,[[footnote]] A similar orifice will be substituted if the mother does not possess a mouth.[[/footnote]], which anomalously elongate to accommodate the child's size. Because newborn SCP-1293 are roughly the same size as their progenitors, it is presumed that gestation takes place within an extradimensional space within SCP-1293-F. If SCP-1293-F are not impregnated[[footnote]]The word "pregnant" is used in this article to describe SCP-1293-F's state between the execution of Procedure 722-Ephraim and the birth of a new SCP-1293. SCP-1293-F cannot be considered pregnant in a literal sense as they have no reproductive organs.[[/footnote]] via Procedure 722-Ephraim, they will produce SCP-1293-K once per month until Procedure 722-Ephraim is executed.

SCP-1293-M are generally lethargic in nature and highly reclusive, avoiding contact with human beings and other specimens of SCP-1293. Unlike SCP-1293-F, SCP-1293-M have shown no capacity for speech. Every forty-five (45) days, SCP-1293-M will congregate and a Terpsichore Event will take place (see Addendum SCP-1293-2). Due to the precisely coordinated nature of Terpsichore Events, it is assumed that SCP-1293-M are capable of communicating telepathically. 

SCP-1293-K are malevolent entities produced by SCP-1293-F if not impregnated via Procedure 722-Ephraim. SCP-1293-K differ from other specimens of SCP-1293 in that they generally possess large teeth, multiple arms, prehensile tongues, and elongated talons. SCP-1293-K are openly hostile toward human beings and will attempt to mutilate any individual it encounters. 

Procedure 722-Ephraim is the process by which SCP-1293-F are impregnated. To begin the procedure, a child, aged 4 to 12 years old and belonging to an on-site personnel member, is to be introduced to the specimen of SCP-1293-F that is in heat. If SCP-1293-F decides that the child is suitable, it will regurgitate a sheet of paper (SCP-1293-A1) and a metal tin of Crayola-brand crayons (SCP-1293-A2). Using his or her imagination, the child must then draw a picture of a humanoid creature. If an adult human attempts to influence the child's drawing process, whether it be during the procedure or beforehand, SCP-1293-F will announce that the child is unsuitable and a different child must be selected. If SCP-1293-F deems the completed SCP-1293-A1 acceptable, it will devour it, thereby impregnating SCP-1293-F. The resulting SCP-1293 specimen will resemble the drawing on SCP-1293-A1.

**Addendum SCP-1293-2:** The following is an interview conducted with a pregnant SCP-1293-F specimen. SCP-1293-F used a number of words and phrases that do not correspond to any known language. These have been transcribed phonetically for the readability and integrity of this interview.

> **<Begin Log>**
> 
> **Dr. Reeves:** Good morning. How are you feeling?
> 
> **SCP-1293-F-4:** Squeedly deedly dee! I'm apsa-tapsa-lutely wonderful, mister nice person type man! My loin child should be ready for regurgitationing in two shakes of a lamb's tail!
> 
> **Dr. Reeves:** Very god. Now, please take a moment to explain your selection process for children used in Procedure 722-Ephraim. 
> 
> **SCP-1293-F-4:** I only look for childrens that are goodly and pure of heart! They also must have great, big, whale-sized imaginations! 
> 
> **Dr. Reeves:** You only accept children belonging to researchers assigned to your containment. Why is this?
> 
> **SCP-1293-F-4:** If I used a stranger's childrens, that would just be squeedly weedly weird! Do you want to see me do a merry jig?
> 
> **Dr. Reeves:** No, thank you. 
> 
> (//SCP-1293-F-4 disregards Dr. Reeves and begins dancing.//) 
> 
> **SCP-1293-F-4:** (//Singing//) Wibbly wibbly woo, I wish I could hug big, beautiful you! Shmiggly shmaggly smarms, I sadly don't have arms! 
> 
> **Dr. Reeves:** That's quite enough. Please try to focus on the interview. What are SCP-1293-K?
> 
> **SCP-1293-F-4:** You mean my whoopsy-daisies? It's note polite to ask a lady-type about her special monthly times, mister nosy posy! 
> 
> **Dr. Reeves:** Any information you could give us on the nature of SCP-1293-K would be greatly beneficial in preventing personnel casualties.
> 
> **SCP-1293-F-4:** I'm sorry they come out so mean and scary! If I don't have the childrens' imagination seed in my wooble spot, I sploosh out things from my own imagination, and I'm afraid that's a very squeedly scary place! 
> 
> **Dr. Reeves:** I'm not sure I—
> 
> **SCP-1293-F-4:** Oh, dear! My loin child cometh!
> 
> (//SCP-1293-F-4 expells SCP-1293-F-5 from its mouth.//)
> 
> **SCP-1293-F-5:** Greetings, loin mother! I am child!
> 
> **SCP-1293-F-4:** It is a lady-type! I am the happy for I have childrens!
> 
> **SCP-1293-F-4 and SCP-1293-F-4, simultaneously:** Squeedle deedle dee!
> 
> **<End Log>**

**Addendum SCP-1293-3:** The following is a message sent to Bio-Site Director Roward by Dr. Goodwin:

> Hello,
> 
> As you aware, I have been the head researcher for SCP-1293 since Dr. Reeves was terminated for unrelated reasons. Having spent roughly a year observing SCP-1293, I have come to the conclusion that present documentation of SCP-1293, particularly in regard to SCP-1293-F's reproductive process, is inaccurate and in urgent need of revision.
> 
> When I was first transferred to this project, I was surprised that Dr. Reeves had based much of SCP-1293's documentation on testimony by SCP-1293-F specimens. Feeling that it was not sufficient to simply take a SCP's words as inherently true, I initiated in place a number of new research guidelines, including the discreet video monitoring of SCP-1293 during the 24 hours following Procedure 722-Ephraim. The footage that we have since obtained has shown that specimens SCP-1293-F and SCP-1293-M, do, in fact, mate, using a thin, red tendril that extends from the male's mouth to the female's. To be blunt, I am appalled that such phenomena has not been previously documented.
> 
> Now that we know SCP-1293 reproduce by mating, that leaves the question of what Procedure 722-Ephraim accomplishes, as well as the question of what SCP-1293-K are. I have a theory that I believe addresses both these issues:
> 
> Contrary to current documentation, SCP-1293 do indeed feed, empathically drawing sustenance from human emotion. SCP-1293-F feed on feelings of unease and perturbation, and SCP-1293-M feed on feelings of confusion and bewilderment. SCP-1293-M are easily capable of subsisting on the feelings expressed by research personnel during Terpsichore Events, but SCP-1293-F must employ more elaborate methods of feeding. In addition to unsettling the children, SCP-1293-F forces us to use our own kids as a ploy to provoke an emotional reaction from jaded Foundation personnel. If SCP-1293-F has gone without "food" for an extended length of time, it will release SCP-1293-K as an emergency defense mechanism.
> 
> In order to test this theory, I propose that a revised version of SCP-1293's special containment procedures will be used on a trial basis. SCP-1293-F and SCP-1293-M are to be kept in separate habitats, as I believe they //should// have been when initially contained. Procedure 722-Ephraim will be altered to use D-Class personnel who have been provided fabricated information about SCP-1293 to enhance their levels of discomfort and anxiety during the process. 
> 
> It is regrettable that it took this long to see these things for what they are, but I hope that with this knowledge, we will be able to contain SCP-1293 with greatly increased efficiency. It is my personal belief that these things were created for the express purpose of screwing with us, and I have no intention of letting their creator win. 

Revisions to SCP-1293's documentation and containment procedures are currently underway.
