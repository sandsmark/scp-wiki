THIS IS AWESOME, TROY! HOW DO I ADD MY OWN!?!?!?

Well, that's simple, Mr. Person Editing This Page.

Toss in a collapsible. Give us the name of your creepy pasta and your name as the "show", and put in a special birthday message as the "hide."  Make sure you put in a line break.

Have fun, guys! And enjoy Gears Day!

> I... Well. I've had quite enough of this. Do you know how long we've been visiting? How long we've been showing up here, spinning the tales for you? Well, I'll tell you. It's been years. Decades! The weavers have been coming here, year after year, giving you these stories, watching them worm their way into your ears and out you eyes and through your tongue, and you've yet to have the common decency to do... to just... Ugh! There is //protocol// in play here, and you are flaunting it, sir. You are flaunting the sacrifice, and the words, and the book. Flaunting it all. It's simply unacceptable. Unacceptable!
> 
> You... You are still listening to them, though... aren't you?
> 
> We have more. We always bring more for you. The story of the table who walked through the door. The one about the six children who nursed on the she bear. The tale of the burning irons, the pick of wonders, the second sun that hid its face, or the speaker of cold nights... Tales! Tales to remind you of a wine you never drank and make you nostalgic for a place that was never real... yet. Tales to weave you a lovely shroud, and tales to sing you to your sleep. Tales that tick like a clock, or a coffin nail. Tales that are waiting, still...
> 
> Happy Birthday. We're waiting.

It's slow, isn't it? Feeling it start to pump through you, move with your arteries and veins. It takes a lot of getting used to, yes? Don't worry, though. It starts slow, then it speeds up, and soon, you won't even notice it. Yes, yes, I know it's quite uncomfortable at first, but it's fine. Eventually, you won't notice.

Well, yes, I suppose that's true. It does get louder, but by then, you'll be so used to hearing everything else that you can't tell. And you've got so much to look forward to! Right now, you get your nutrients through this system, but soon, you'll get to have it yourself.

Yes, but not like that. Hah! Oh, if you could see. It's a marvelous setup we have. 

Now, don't you worry. I know this is very new to you, lots of meat and wetness, but it'll come to be quite comfortable. It's only eight more months until your insertion begins. You should enjoy this time. Lots of time to think and plan. It should be quite delightful. Just don't forget while you're here -- you have a job to do.

Don't fuck it up.[[/collapsible]]

You never believed in old superstitions. All nonsense - demons, ghosts?

Silliness.

You were, however, very eager to take centre stage in your friend's amateur horror movie, even looking up the kind of "rituals" a believer would use - mainly for a lack of imagination.

Some of your more superstitious - or more religious - friends wouldn't stay for the ritual scene.

Silliness.

Just some ominous chanting, and pretending to spill your own blood in a weird drawing on the floor.

Even those who stayed looked nervous.

Silliness.

You weren't counting on your knife hand slipping and cutting yourself to the bone. Amateur horror productions don't typically have a large prop budget.

You almost certainly weren't counting on an incomprehensible dark satire of the human form crawling out of the hole that wasn't there before your blood hit the ground, turning its irregular face on you and screaming from a hole in its cheek.

It would be silly to count on that, after all.

You weren't counting on the demon reading your mind and becoming insulted at the idea that it was "silly."

You tried to run but your toes were caught on something, and your foot began to harden. You weren't able to move your legs and your arms froze in position as the demon encased you in stone.

You had to watch your friends die slowly, their eyes pleading for mercy and their mouths screaming for death. Eventually, each of their dead bodies were absorbed into the demon, furthering the irregularity of its shape.

You were not granted such release. Your friend's misplaced eyes mocked you from shoulders, arms, and legs as the demon fell back into its hole, pausing only to amicably say four words through its misshapen cheek-flap.

"Not so silly now."[[/collapsible]]

> Ah, what jolly good times are in store for us! Ah, such wonderful new things for us to learn! 
> 
> Listen well, and you can almost hear the rattling of the machineguns already. Your nose is keen, do you find the whiff of rotten corpses as intoxicating as I? 
> 
> Not much longer to wait, and it will all be ours. In just a bit, we will be neck deep in the dead. Then we can sleep! Isn't that grand, my dear old friend? 
> 
> To walk among the weeping nations, and to feast? No.
> 
> To stand among the kneeling mourners and sing? Close, but not quite.  
> 
> To dance to the rhythm of spent lives? Almost there, my friend. 
> 
> What is best than to dream nightmares of a dying century?
