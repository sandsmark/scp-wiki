**Item #:** SCP-4193

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** All known instances of SCP-4193 are to be kept in a secure container at Site-23. Test subjects may only be administered more than one dose of SCP-4193 if due for termination or if a long-term humanoid containment cell is available.

**Description:** SCP-4193 is the group designation for a supply of 32 blue pharmaceutical caplets [[footnote]]73 before testing[[/footnote]], 8mm in diameter with the "playboy bunny" embossed on them. On acquisition, the caplets were stored inside a commercially available 8 dram amber vial with reversible cap[[footnote]]A typical, non-anomalous "pill bottle" used in US pharmacies.[[/footnote]] with a laser-printed label[[footnote]]Avery 5160 size[[/footnote]] in comic sans which read: "migraine medicine e by dado take 1 pill not 2 pill u trust dado"

The first time an SCP-4193 caplet is ingested orally[[footnote]]Use as a suppository is only 80% as effective, see Supplement 4193-2 for full test data.[[/footnote]], it acts as a combination of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) of the propionic acid class and a triptan, except with nearly instant effect and no side effects other than slight pupil dilation. SCP-4193 relieves migraines, cluster headaches, fever, swelling, and muscle stiffness. If the subject suffers from chronic migraines, intervals between regular episodes will increase from 30 to 180 days.[[footnote]]While full test logs can be found in Supplement 4193-2, Dr. ████ ███████ has requested that the commentary of D-76683, an SCP-4193 test subject with debilitating, chronic, treatment-resistant migraines be added to this report in the footnotes at appropriate points as representative of general trends shown by SCP-4193 users. Upon his first dose, D-76683 declared SCP-4193 to be "better than sex. The best, fastest and most goddamn effective migraine medicine I've ever taken. Wish I could celebrity endorse this shit."[[/footnote]]

The second time a particular subject is administered an SCP-4193 caplet, in addition to the above effects, the subject's eyes, including the skull's eye sockets and all connective and nerve tissue, painlessly decrease in size by 50%[[footnote]]Plus or minus 2%, see Supplement 4193-2 for full test data.[[/footnote]] over the course of half a second. After the metamorphic change, the subject is myopic (nearsighted)[[footnote]]degree of myopia varies from subject to subject[[/footnote]], similar to some cases of microphthalmia and/or nanophthalmos.[[footnote]]Hyperopia (farsightedness) is more common in individuals with non-anomalous genetic microphthalmia or nanophthalmos, but myopia does occur. Aside from any myopia, all sight defects are healed by the metamorphic change induced by SCP-4193, including blindness, so long as the subject has intact eyeballs.[[/footnote]] The subject gains the anomalous ability to focus on objects to a level of detail approximately equivalent to looking through a 10x magnification optical microscope. Subjects describe using this anomalous ability as "like zooming in with a camera."[[footnote]]D-76683 commentary: "Still better than sex, even with the tiny eye thing and the puke-worthy thing where I can see the pores on my hands and stuff."[[/footnote]]

Subsequently, each time an SCP-4193 caplet is ingested, the subject's eyeball decreases in size by another 50%, the myopia becomes more acute, and the possible "magnification" increases tenfold. This process hits a limit when a subject's eyes are 1mm in diameter, providing vision that tests at approximately 6/30[[footnote]]20/100 vision in the US[[/footnote]] on the Visual Acuity scale[[footnote]]Since subjects with such extreme effective nanophthalmos should have much worse vision (de facto blindness), the anomalous abilities granted by SCP-4193 are likely a factor here.[[/footnote]] and the equivalent of roughly 10,000x magnification. However, from the third SCP-4193 caplet onward, SCP-4193 releases anywhere from 40 to ███ mg of MDMA[[footnote]]Street name: Ecstasy or Molly[[/footnote]] into the subject's bloodstream.[[footnote]]D-76683 commentary: "FUCK YEAH! Now this //is// sex!"[[/footnote]] While some test subjects consistently received a relatively safe amount of MDMA, multiple test subjects died from acute MDMA toxicity[[footnote]]Overdose.[[/footnote]] following hyperthermia, hyponatraemia, serotonin syndrome, and multiple organ failure before reaching the limit of SCP-4193's other anomalous effects.[[footnote]]Statistical analysis is ongoing to determine if there is a correlating factor that determines how much MDMA is released by SCP-4193 into a subject's bloodstream.[[/footnote]]

Test subjects may report hallucinations after taking an SCP-4193 caplet.[[footnote]]On average, hallucinations started after the fourth or fifth dose. This data only includes subjects that survived at least five doses of SCP-4193. See Supplement 4193-2 for full test data.[[/footnote]] Once experienced, these side effects never abate[[footnote]]D-76683 attempted suicide several times after these side effects set in, and is currently on suicide watch, serving as a test subject for therapies aimed at reducing or eliminating these symptoms, though none have been effective so far.[[/footnote]] and consist of the following regardless of test subject:

* Some humans are seen as motile corpses, wet with rot and extensively infested with slow-moving worms or maggots; the worms are described as approximately 0.1 mm thick and never described as longer than 5 mm
* Some humans, usually authority figures or loved ones, are perceived as human-shaped swarms of insects; swarm organisms are of varying types and no individual insect is ever described as longer than 5 mm
* Subjects report minuscule humanoids, 2 to 10 mm in height, which attempt to crawl into the orifices of living humans, especially the test subject[[footnote]]D-76683 commentary: "If the little guys get inside you, they kill you and become the worms. They have a plan, but you don't want to fucking know."[[/footnote]]

**Supplement 4193-1:** Discovery

The bottle of SCP-4193 caplets was discovered while going through the effects of a minor Person of Interest, Rhonda Clayton, after her death on 2016-11-03 at age 94. Starting at the age of 20, Clayton acquired an extensive criminal record, with charges including fraud, racketeering[[footnote]]numbers games and fencing stolen goods[[/footnote]], and violation of the Harrison Narcotics Tax Act. After being released from prison in 1962, her criminal activities appeared to cease; Clayton had no further negative interactions with the law on public record, even traffic violations. Starting in 2013, Clayton made a small name for herself in the non-anomalous art scene[[footnote]]Primarily in her home state of Texas; she was featured in several shows and galleries across the state from 2013 to 2016.[[/footnote]] carvings toothpicks into miniature sculpture[[footnote]]mostly religious themes[[/footnote]] using dentist's tools. Clayton came to Foundation attention in 2014 when she started cultivating friendships in the anomalous art scene, including an extensive mail correspondence with Person of Interest █████ ███████.

In addition, Foundation agents found the following email correspondence on a desktop PC in PoI Clayton's bedroom, evidence, in conjunction with the bottle's label, that the SCP-4193 caplets had been produced by "dado," a Person of Interest responsible for creating several anomalous pharmaceutical products and anomalous businesses.

I can wear my prescription sunglasses[[footnote]]PoI Clayton already suffered from extreme myopia (6/40 vision) as of her last ophthalmologist appointment on 2015-01-13[[/footnote]] when I go out or when someone visits, at my age I can't afford vanity anyway.

> HOLY SHIT I WANT TO GO DANCING LEAVING ALL THE FEEDBACK[[footnote]]There is no record of anyone resembling PoI dado as a seller on Amazon during this time period, or even as a registered user of Amazon or Amazon Prime.[[/footnote]]

Additional email correspondence on the desktop computer confirmed that PoI Clayton recommended PoI dado to relatives and acquaintances of her old criminal contacts and to her associates in the art scene. Foundation analysts conclude that PoI Clayton's enthusiastic recommendations may be partially or indirectly responsible for some of the pharmaceutical requests received by PoI dado.

PoI Clayton died in a head-on collision with a semi truck after driving on the left side of the I-35 highway in her 2002 Honda Civic at a speed of roughly 100 kph, greatly attenuating the length of her vehicle, crushing her corpse and pulping her skull. When PoI Clayton's home in Austin, TX was searched by the Foundation, in addition to the desktop computer and SCP-4193, agents discovered a sculpture[[footnote]]The sculpture is non-anomalous and is currently kept in low security storage at Site-64.[[/footnote]] different from PoI Clayton's usual work. The sculpture is nine feet tall, vaguely humanoid, with bovine-like horns, and made of approximately 200,000 interlocking toothpick carvings, each of a maggot with a smiling human face. The sculpture had an attached post-it note, photographed below:
