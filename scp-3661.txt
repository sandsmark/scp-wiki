**Item number:** SCP-3661

**Item Class:**  --Safe-- ##blue|Euclid##

**Special Containment Procedures:**  Each SCP-3661-1 object is kept at Site-17 --in an internally monitored low-value item locker at least 10m away from-- ##blue|in an appropriately furnished humanoid containment cell with##  its corresponding instance of SCP-3661-2. Tests involving disassembly of SCP-3661-1 objects --require approval from L3 or higher research staff--
  ##blue|require approval from site director and RAISA supervision.##

SCP-3661-2 instances are housed in separate, appropriately furnished humanoid containment cells. Each containment cell is to be located --within 5m of-- ##blue|at least 10m away from## the nearest staff observation post.

--To protect SCP-3661-2 instances from activation events, the instances are not to be in contact with SCP-3661-1 objects outside of approved testing. ##blue|SCP-3661-1 activation events are not to be interrupted under any circumstance.##

**Description:** SCP-3661-1 is the collective designation assigned to various infant toys contaminated by anomalous mechanical components. SCP-3661-1 objects are visually indistinguishable from typical toys or dolls. The anomalous components are concealed within the objects, though --apparently-- mechanical parts emerge during activation events.

Instances of SCP-3661-1 are designated SCP-3661-1A, SCP-3661-1B, and so on. The Foundation has contained ███  SCP-3661-1 objects since first encounter in 19██ . SCP-3661-1 components have been found in both mass-produced and handmade toys. Each SCP-3661-1 object contained by the Foundation corresponds with a specific instance of SCP-3661-2.

SCP-3661-2 is the collective designation assigned to human newborns and infants targeted by SCP-3661-1 objects. No instance of SCP-3661-2 has displayed anomalous properties aside from causing activation of SCP-3661-1 objects.

SCP-3661-1 objects periodically activate when their corresponding SCP-3661-2 enters REM sleep. During activation, SCP-3661-1 objects extrude hair-thin “wires” tipped with [tech info redacted]. The wires use --unknown technology-- ##blue|L-IV classified technology## to achieve serpentine movement. No method of predicting or controlling SCP-3661-1 activation has been discovered.

Wires extended by SCP-3661-1 have demonstrated the ability to reach up to 4 meters, and are able to navigate around objects and through obstacles (e.g. closed toy chests). The means by which SCP-3661-1 objects achieve this navigation is unknown, as is the means by which it obtains information about the status and location of SCP-3661-2.

The wires seek the corresponding SCP-3661-2 instance and enter its body through passageways such as the tear ducts, esophagus, and urethra. SCP-3661-1 wires have also been observed to enter targets by making small incisions on the face, neck, or limbs and [tech info redacted]. 

Research indicates that SCP-3661-1 wires administer an anesthetic that prevents SCP-3661-2 from waking during activation events. Approximately 8% of SCP-3661-2 instances in containment display extreme distress during activation events, which is hypothesized to be caused by immunity to this effect.

SCP-3661 activation events last, on average, for 8 minutes and 43 seconds. At the conclusion of activation events, SCP-3661-1 objects retract all wires through the passageways by which they entered. Internal imaging of SCP-3661-2 instances during activation events (conducted via drone) shows [tech info redacted].

When another human approaches within approximately 5m during an activation event, SCP-3661-1 objects fully retract all wires near-instantaneously (within 0.15 seconds). This procedure carries a risk (approximately █%) of an apparent malfunction in which the wires fail to tunnel backward and create exit wounds instead, causing major tissue damage to SCP-3661-2. For this reason, --tests involving contact between SCP-3661-1 and SCP-3661-2 require Ethics Committee approval-- ##blue|activation events are not to be interrupted under any circumstance.##

The internal injuries caused by exposure to SCP-3661-1 activity are not detectable by civilian medical equipment, and are typically misdiagnosed as autoimmune disorders or other systemic conditions. Long-term exposure to SCP-3661-1 activity causes fatal organ failure; SCP-3661-2 instances that are not separated from the associated 3661-1 object expire within ██ months.

██% of SCP-3661-1 objects in containment have been observed to cease activation before this time, and apparently become inert. No way to predict or control this phenomenon has been found. --Research is ongoing.--

**First encounter:** The Foundation initially catalogued SCP-3XXX when routine data mining indicated possible anomalous activity during a 911 call in [location redacted] on ██/██/19██.

> Operator: 911, what is your emergency?

> Caller: We have a doll in our daughter's bed, it's, it's a rabbit. From [location redacted]. There's strings coming out of it and they're going into her. Oh shit. Oh shit. Shhh. Oh no.

> O: Sir, I need your address.

> C: OK, OK. Um. [address redacted]. Please, please, please, baby, shhh, come on, baby.

> O: Your daughter is tangled in strings from a doll?

> C: No, no, they're, they're going into her. Into her eye, and her neck. Fuck, there's one in her ear. Shhh. Oh, baby. It's going to be okay. Fuck. She won't stop crying. I can't get them out.

> O: Sir, do not attempt to remove -

> C: Oh, baby. It's going to be okay, baby, it's going to be okay. I already tried cutting them but they're like, metal, or something. Oh my poor baby. What the fuck is this. She's crying so much.

> O: Sir, a unit will be there soon.

> C: Fuck, I can see it through her neck. No, no, no, baby, don't move. This was her favorite bunny. Please stop crying.

Civilian medical services transported the doll and the infant (later designated SCP 3661-1A and 3661-2A, respectively) to [hospital redacted], where they were intercepted by foundation personnel.

Surgeons at Site-17 were unable to separate SCP-3661-2A from the object; the instance expired 4 hours and 28 minutes into the procedure. Autopsy revealed that the main cluster of wires had maneuvered around the eyeball to access [tech info redacted] through the optic cavity. Additional wires had [tech info redacted] through the eardrum, and tunneled through the neck and thoracic cavity to make contact with the heart.

Cover story 3661-CS1 ("loose-object strangulation") was established; MTF Epsilon-11 ("Doctor Feelgoods") altered hospital records and witness accounts to match cover story.

It is hypothesized that SCP-3661-1A malfunctioned during the activation event, preventing its wires from retracting. No similar incident has been recorded during SCP-3661's containment.

**Addendum**

During routine examination, SCP-3661-2BW displayed symptoms of liver failure despite having been separated from SCP-3661-1BW. Uncatalogued SCP-3661-1 components were found in the mattress of SCP-3661-2BW's containment cell. Review of security footage ruled out tampering by research team. Ability to breach containment justifies upgrade to Euclid status; upgrade requested. (,,Granted - L4 Director Hogue,,)

During examination of SCP-3661-1's anomalous mechanical components, Junior researcher Pao noted a resemblance to [tech info redacted]. 

Petition for special research access submitted to O5 via site director Hogue. Junior Researcher Pao, Junior Research Randall, and Senior Researcher Siczybski, with oversight from Research Task Force Omega-9 ("The Librarians"), are to be given access to all SCP research files security level 4 and below for the purpose of cross-referencing this new information. Researchers consented to amnestic treatment following special access.
[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show ="+ From: O5-11 ___ To: L4 Site Director Hogue" hide ="L4 access confirmed"]]
Good morning, Director.

Researchers Pao, Randall and Siczybski should each be given a commendation of merit, and 2 weeks paid leave, following their recovery.

Per the findings of the Siczybski-Randall-Pao report, all technical data and other sensitive information about SCP-3661 is immediately reclassified at level IV security. RAISA will be censoring the documentation accordingly.

Please inform the L4/3661 staff that we expect updated procedures to be in place by the end of this week. Your objections have been noted, but the Ethics Committee has already finished their assessment and found the new protocols to be necessary. Failure to comply risks a temporal paradox. According to the Librarians, we're lucky it hasn't happened already.

Now that we know what they are, it's only a matter of time before the GOI find out. Additional resources will be allocated to your site to enhance security. A full audit will be conducted by the Compliance Team to prevent the inevitable leaks for as long as we can. Congratulations on the former, and I'm sorry about the latter.

We don't know when, but those probes will eventually be placed by the Foundation. Maybe by you or I. We wouldn't do this lightly. The mission they're on needs to succeed.

Secure, contain, protect,
O5-11
