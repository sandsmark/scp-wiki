Writing a SCP can be hard, I know. It can be hard coming up with a good idea. It can be hard to get the clinical tone down right, especially if you're a new writer or are used to writing in a different, more plot-based style. That being said, there are certain common misuses of technical terminology which drive us nuts. Try to not abuse these words.

----
+ **__Grammar & General Word Usage__**

: **you're/your, there/they're/their, to/too/two, its/it's** : These are the most commonly abused words online. If they were animals, they'd be starring in an ASPCA commercial specifically designed to make you feel ashamed of being a human being. You can look up their correct usage pretty much anywhere online. //MAKE SURE YOU DON'T FUCK THESE UP.//
: **affect/effect** : Another commonly abused word pair. Although the two words are related, "affect" is a verb and "effect" is a noun (usually). To "affect" something is to make some sort of change or influence to it. An "effect" is whatever the result of that change or influence is. You affect something to have an effect on it.
: **terminated** : On this site, that pretty much means one thing: "intentionally executed or killed as an outcome of a policy process". It's also terribly over-used. Try just saying "killed", or say they were transferred to another project or returned to the D-class workforce or something. see also [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/how-to-write-an-scp#toc5 | How To Write An SCP:Creative Writing Tips 'Terminate']]]
: **crescendo** : A crescendo is a musical term that refers to something gradually increasing. It has been used as a term for the climax of the crescendo, but caution is advised, as many consider that incorrect usage.
----
+ **__Mathematics__**

: **exponential** : This is a math-based term which a lot of people seem to think just means "a whole lot". This is not the case. It means that something is changing at an ever faster increasing or decreasing rate (yes, exponential means it can be getting smaller, too). Saying something like "it's exponentially hard" is meaningless A) without a standard baseline "hardness" to compare it to and B) unless the "hardness" is actually changing. See how the following is changing faster and faster:
|| x= || 0 (baseline) || 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 ||
|| 2^^x^^= || 1 || 2 || 4 || 8 || 16 || 32 ||
|| 2^^-x^^= || 1 || 0.5 || 0.25 || 0.125 || 0.0625 || 0.03125 ||
|| x^^2^^= || 0 || 1 || 4 || 9 || 16 || 25 ||
|| x^^1/2^^= || 0 || 1 || 1.414 || 1.732 || 2 || 2.236 ||
: **Unit designations & Prefixes** : This covers a variety of the hard sciences, so I'm putting it here rather than in one of the more specific sub-categories. Obviously you need to use the correct unit for whatever your scientific measurement is (and remember that we use metric, not Imperial units), but also note that the [[[units|capitalization matters]]]. There are only so many letters available to use for unit/prefix abbreviations, and one of the ways that the scientific community tries to stretch them is to use upper and lower case capitalization to indicate different things, and even then there's some unavoidable overlapping. "L" is not the same thing as "l", "M" is not the same thing as "m" (which can actually mean either "meters" or "milli" depending on usage), "G" is not the same thing as "g", etc. It would take too much room to include a complete list of units, but there is a quick guide to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_prefix unit prefixes]:
||~ Prefix Name ||~ Prefix Abbreviation ||~ Multiplication Factor ||
|| tera || T || 1 000 000 000 000 (10^^12^^) ||
|| giga || G || 1 000 000 000 (10^^9^^) ||
|| mega || M || 1 000 000 (10^^6^^) ||
|| kilo || k || 1 000 (10^^3^^) ||
|| milli || m || 0.001 (10^^-3^^) _
(^^1^^/,,1 000,,) ||
|| micro || μ or u || 0.000 001 (10^^-6^^) _
(^^1^^/,,1 000 000,,) ||
|| nano || n || 0.000 000 001 (10^^-9^^) _
(^^1^^/,,1 000 000 000,,) ||
|| pico || p || 0.000 000 000 001 (10^^-12^^) _

+ **__Physics__**

: **ray vs. wave** : A ray is a directed, targeted emanation of a substance, such as light or radiation. It can be focused to affect a much tighter (or larger) effect zone, but there //will// be some spreading at the target, even if it's only very slight. It can travel through a vacuum. A wave is a force effect that has to travel through a medium. Sound is a wave, because it's vibrations (force) in a substance like air or water. A wave can be pointed in a specific direction, but tends to spread out much more than a ray. It //cannot// travel without something to travel //in//. Note: Light is a special case, in that it acts both like a particle and like a wave. It can be confusing, so try to read up on what effect you're intending of it before saying one way or the other.
: **Quantum Physics** : The study of physics at the atomic and subatomic scale, where particles react in ways that seem to make very little sense. Since even scientists get headaches thinking about quantum physics, all you really need to know for this site is that //you should never use the word "Quantum" to describe anything in an SCP article, --unless-- ESPECIALLY IF you actually know something about quantum physics//.
: **Voltage** : Voltage, or Potential Difference, unit Volt (V) or Joule/Coulomb (J/C), is the **measure of energy per unit charge** the charge carriers possess in a flow. Example of high voltage , very low current circuit is the shock you get from static electricity when you walk around on dry carpetting. Its water analogy is pressure.
: **Current** : Current, unit Ampere (A) or Coulomb/second (C/s), is the **measure of charge carrier flow** in a circuit. An example of large current, low voltage flow would be the current through the tip of a soldering gun. Its water analogy is volumetric flow rate.
: **Power (electrical)** : Power, unit Watt (W) or Joule/second (J/s), is the **measure of rate of change of energy with time**. In the case of electric circuit, it is the dot product of voltage and current. (P = V∙I = VI cos k , where k is the phase angle). Its water analogy is still power - this concept exists across all physics.
: **dielectric breakdown strength** :  The maximum electric field an insulator can sustain before it breaks down, and starts conducting current. For dry air, this value is about 3kV/mm - that is, a potential difference of 3000 V must exist for each millimetre of an air gap before the gap can support an electric arc. A natural example of dielectric breakdown of air is lightning. Its water analogy would be the pressure sustained by a thickness of barrier before it breaks - think of a bit of balloon skin tied over the end of a water faucet.
: **Energy** : Energy can be defined as "the ability a physical system has to do work on other physical systems" ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy Wikipedia]). It can appear in several forms, such as kinetic (movement) energy, electromagnetic radiation, and potential energy. Energy cannot be destroyed or created, but only changed into other forms of energy or matter. There is no such thing as 'pure energy', as energy cannot be impure, though it is sometimes used in reference to the energy of mass, which is released as high-energy photons and low-mass particles such as pions. Also note that 'energy beings' of science fiction are often formed from plasma, which possesses energy but is still a phase of matter. Because energy can come in many forms, it is important to specify what kind of energy the SCP uses/produces/whatever, //if that energy usage is critical to the concept//. We don't need to know that your computer SCP runs on electricity, but if your SCP "emits a mysterious energy", we need to know if it's kinetic (the sucker vibrates), electromagnetic (it pulsates with light &/or radiation), electrical (electrical sparks cover it at all times), etc.

+ **__Biology__**

: **evolution** : First of all, we are discussing evolution from a biological standpoint here. Now: evolution is something that refers to changes in a //species//, not an //individual//. It's the accumulation of changes to a population that results in a total overall, average drift in the characteristics of the species as a whole that results in the species being better able to survive in its environment. Evolution is neither good nor bad and, in the real world, does not have a goal. Evolution does not think. Saying something is "more evolved" than something else is a meaningless phrase and does //not// mean "is better/more complex/more powerful". Humans evolved from ancient monkeys, but that doesn't mean that we're "more evolved" than chimpanzees. It just means that we evolved differently than they did.
: **parasitic vs. parasitoid** : 
> To quote [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism Wikipedia]:
> "Parasitism is differentiated from the parasitoid relationship, though not sharply, by the fact that parasitoids generally kill or sterilise their hosts."
>
> If your object is usually consumes or is otherwise fatal to the host, use "parasitoid", otherwise use "parasitic". Both types can use //parasitic// as a  [[[Attribute Tag Guide|page tag]]].

**binomial nomenclature** (courtesy of Photosynthetic)
> There is a very specific set of rules for formatting organisms' scientific names. Please use them correctly.
> 
> Species names are always italicized. They consist of two words: the first word is the genus name and the second is the specific epithet. The genus name is always capitalized, and the specific epithet never is: //Homo sapiens//, //Cymothoa exigua//, //Hypsibius dujardini//. Names of genera may be used alone, to refer to all species in the genus: //Homo//, //Cymothoa//, //Hypsibus//. Names of higher-level taxa -- families, orders, classes, phyla, kingdoms -- are capitalized, but not italicized: Hominidae, Hymenophyllaceae, Malacostraca, Tardigrada.
> 
> To denote a subspecies, just add the second specific epithet: //Homo sapiens sapiens//, //Ursus arctos horribilis//. To denote a variety, add "var." (not italicized) before the second specific epithet: //Hebe salicifolia// var. //stricta//.
> 
> When a species is mentioned several times in the same report, or when two species of the same genus are referred to in quick succession, the genus name can be abbreviated -- but //only after the first time it is fully spelled out.// At that point, you can replace it with its initial: //H. sapiens//, //C. exigua//, //H. dujardini//.
>

+ **__Neurology & Mental__**

: **sentient vs. sapient** : This pair gets confused to mean the same thing //A LOT//, so don't feel //too// bad for using them interchangably. Just learn to not do it. Technically speaking (which is what we're going for here), "sentient" just means that the creature has the ability to sense and react to its environment. Animals are sentient, some plants are sentient, objects can be sentient if they're obviously reacting to environmental cues. "Sapient" means that it can think (it's right in the name of our species: //Homo sapiens sapiens//). Most animals are //not// sapient, no regular plants are, but electronic intelligences might be. A short-hand might be to ask whether or not the creature is capable of being aware that it's thinking about something.
**IQ (courtesy of Quikngruvn)**
> The statistic called [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_quotient IQ] (Intelligence Quotient) is defined as a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution normal distribution] with mean μ=100 and standard deviation σ=15. The upshot is that you can calculate what percentage of a population should have an IQ above (or below) certain values, especially when Wikipedia [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution#Standard_deviation_and_confidence_intervals provides] these values out to 6σ. Anyway, the percentage of population with greater than a given IQ:
> 
>> 100: 50.00%, 1 out of every 2
>> 115: 15.87%, 1 out of every 6
>> 130: 2.275%, 1 out of every 44
>> 145: 0.1350%, 1 out of every 741
>> 160: 0.003167%, 1 out of every 31,574
>> 175: 0.00002867%, 1 out of every 3,488,557
>> 190: 0.00000009865%, 1 out of every 1,013,684,744
> 
> So right now, there should be six or seven people in the whole world with an IQ of at least 190. (Conversely, there should also be six or seven people in the world right now with an IQ of less than 10.) How IQ is actually quantified is left as an exercise to the reader (though the method used isn't so important if they all use the same scale).
> 
> What about [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilyn_vos_Savant Marilyn vos Savant] and her record high IQ? Essentially, her score of 228 came from older testing methodologies (using the ratio of mental age to chronological age) and so she wouldn't score so high on newer tests, in addition to the inherent difficulties in measuring extremes of intelligence. On this scale, she would score at least 185.
> 
> **(Drewbear's addition)** Also note that essentially all mainstream IQ tests in use nowadays rate on several scales which address different functional areas such as working memory, processing speed and verbal comprehension. They do //NOT// test things such as personality or creativity, as these are much, much harder to quantify. IQ testing is also sensitive to environmental conditions like how the testee is feeling that day, what the weather is like (seriously. It influences mood and performance), and how recently the testee has had a similar test. It's perfectly common to see scores vary a bit, so someone could get a score of 101 one time and 98 another.
> 
> Finally, keep in mind that IQ testing is based on average human populations and experiences. It would be very difficult to say a non-human intelligence has an IQ score of X.

+ __**Engineering**__

: **tensile strength** : A measure for how far a material can be stretched before it ruptures. Spider silk has a higher tensile strength than steel, and rubber has a higher tensile strength than glass fibers.
: **hardness** : A harder material will normally also be more brittle. For example, obsidian is harder than copper, but shatters very easily. A softer material deforms easily, but may or may not spring back to its original shape.
----
+ __**Computers, Computing & Software**__

: **upload vs download vs transfer** : The difference between "upload" and "download" is as subtle as the prefix of each word: upload implies that you are sending information from the source you are working on to another location, while download implies you are taking it from another location to your own. It gets somewhat muddled when using diskettes, CD's/DVD's and multiple hard disk drives; the most common is that you upload to the removable media and download from it; this is often simply called "transfer" for simplicity sake.
: **hardware terminology** : While the colloquial is certainly allowable for most tales and SCPs where the technology is not the main focus, usage of a computer or computer-based anomaly as the central point of an SCP begs for certain formalities. A brief break-down: the "brain" is the processor, CPU technically refers to the entire tower; RAM means "Random Access Memory" and is what is most-often called simply "memory"; on-board storage is the Hard Disk Drive (also HDD) not just "hard disk" or "hard drive"; ROM means "read only memory" and is the technical term when using a CD or DVD (hence CD-ROM or DVD-ROM, whereas a rewritable uses CD-RW or DVD-RW); the "old floppies" are technically diskettes.

+ __**Materials Science**__

**[[[https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Titanium |Titanium, Ti]]]**  //by VAElynx// 
> The holy grail of hollywood metallurgy, this metal is often treated as the Superman of materials. In reality it's a lot more like Xander Harris - reliable and useful, but it's not magic, and rarely works well on its own.
> 
> Pure titanium has a tensile strength - basically, the maximum pulling force per surface area a specimen can withstand - of about 434 MPa. For comparison, Al-Cu-Mg alloys (dural) typically reach 450 MPa, and medium carbon steels go up to 1200 MPa. As such, designing a containment cell with titanium walls makes about as much sense as importing a Trabant via airlift would make for an American - you aren't getting the value for your money, and the only people it'll impress are those with no idea what you are talking about.
> 
> Titanium alloys have far better properties in this respect, matching steels, but with a far lower density.[[footnote]]In fact, the whole reason for its inappropriate glorification appears to be conflating of strength to density ratio, where titanium alloys are near the top as far as metal goes, and plain strength, which is merely mid-range [[/footnote]]  As such, it is well suited for aerospace applications, but given that mass is rarely an issue in containment cell design, steel is most likely a better option. 
> 
> There's a couple of cases where titanium plating on the inside of a containment cell would work well - titanium is resistant to most dilute acids and chemical corrosive agents, and has a high melting point - around 1900 K. [[footnote]] While titanium does react with oxygen at temperatures lower than that, around 1500K for air, all that does is form an oxide layer on the surface, preventing further burn. The reason why you wouldn't make the whole cell from it is that by this point it would have softened considerably, which would likely lead to structural collapse [[/footnote]] Therefore, using such designs to contain heat-based entities, or objects that chemically attack their surroundings works well as an alternative to ceramic plating in cases where the latter's mechanical properties (low fracture toughness for one) might pose a problem.

+ __**Diseases**__
: **Foreword** : In general, all diseases are mostly different. Symptoms, advancement, and how the virus/bacteria function are not consistent from disease to disease. The point is that you know the details of whatever ailment you are talking about. This can refer to genetic disorders as well.

: **Cancer** : Cancer is not a single kind, strain, genus, etc. Cancer is a mutation of cells that grow exponentially. Cancer is not an organism. There are thousands of kinds of cancers, and Wikipedia as well as other scholarly journals can give you specifics.
