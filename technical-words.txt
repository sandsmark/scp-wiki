Writing a SCP can be hard, I know. It can be hard coming up with a good idea. It can be hard to get the clinical tone down right, especially if you're a new writer or are used to writing in a different, more plot-based style. That being said, there are certain common misuses of technical terminology which drive us nuts. Try to not abuse these words.

: **you're/your, there/they're/their, to/too/two, its/it's** : These are the most commonly abused words online. If they were animals, they'd be starring in an ASPCA commercial specifically designed to make you feel ashamed of being a human being. You can look up their correct usage pretty much anywhere online. //MAKE SURE YOU DON'T FUCK THESE UP.//
: **affect/effect** : Another commonly abused word pair. Although the two words are related, "affect" is a verb and "effect" is a noun (usually). To "affect" something is to make some sort of change or influence to it. An "effect" is whatever the result of that change or influence is. You affect something to have an effect on it.
: **exponential** : This is a math-based term which a lot of people seem to think just means "a whole lot". This is not the case. It means that something is changing at an ever faster increasing or decreasing rate (yes, exponential means it can be getting smaller, too). Saying something like "it's exponentially hard" is meaningless A) without a standard baseline "hardness" to compare it to and B) unless the "hardness" is actually changing. See how the following is changing faster and faster:
|| x= || 0 (baseline) || 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 ||
|| 2^^x^^= || 1 || 2 || 4 || 8 || 16 || 32 ||
|| 2^^-x^^= || 1 || 0.5 || 0.25 || 0.125 || 0.0625 || 0.03125 ||
|| x^^2^^= || 0 || 1 || 4 || 9 || 16 || 25 ||
|| x^^1/2^^= || 0 || 1 || 1.414 || 1.732 || 2 || 2.236 ||
: **sentient/sapient** : This pair gets confused to mean the same thing //A LOT//, so don't feel //too// bad for using them interchangably. Just learn to not do it. Technically speaking (which is what we're going for here), "sentient" just means that the creature has the ability to sense and react to its environment. Animals are sentient, some plants are sentient, objects can be sentient if they're obviously reacting to environmental cues. "Sapient" means that it can think (it's right in the name of our species: //homo sapiens sapiens//). Most animals are //not// sapient, no regular plants are, but electronic intelligences might be. A short-hand might be to ask whether or not the creature is capable of being aware that it's thinking about something.
: **terminated** : On this site, that pretty much means one thing: killed. It's also terribly over-used. Try just saying "killed", or say they were transferred to another project or returned to the D-class workforce or something.
: **ray vs. wave** : A ray is a directed, targeted emanation of a substance, such as light or radiation. It can be focused to affect a much tighter (or larger) effect zone, but there //will// be some spreading at the target, even if it's only very slight. It can travel through a vacuum. A wave is a force effect that has to travel through a medium. Sound is a wave, because it's vibrations (force) in a substance like air or water. A wave can be pointed in a specific direction, but tends to spread out much more than a ray. It //cannot// travel without something to travel //in//. Note: Light is a special case, in that it acts both like a particle and like a wave. It can be confusing, so try to read up on what effect you're intending of it before saying one way or the other.
: **evolution** : First of all, we are discussing evolution from a biological standpoint here. Now: evolution is something that refers to changes in a //species//, not an //individual//. It's the accumulation of changes to a population that results in a total overall, average drift in the characteristics of the species as a whole that results in the species being better able to survive in its environment. Evolution is neither good nor bad and, in the real world, does not have a goal. Evolution does not think. Saying something is "more evolved" than something else is a meaningless phrase and does //not// mean "is better/more complex/more powerful". Humans evolved from ancient monkeys, but that doesn't mean that we're "more evolved" than chimpanzees. It just means that we evolved differently than they did.

This is by no means a comprehensive list, and I welcome other people making additions of egregiously abused words, but remember to keep it civil.
