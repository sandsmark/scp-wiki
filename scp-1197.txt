**Item #:** SCP-1197

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1197 is to be fitted with a Foundation issue keycard lock designed to match neighboring units. Management has been instructed to inform both staff and guests that SCP-1197 is indefinitely inaccessible.

2 armed personnel are to be incorporated into the civilian staff in the security office. Any subjects emerging from SCP-1197 are to be detained and administered medical and psychological treatment before being interviewed.

Following an active session SCP-1197 is to be thoroughly searched and cleaned with the entrance door secured open. Any anomalous items and bodies are to be removed and studied. SCP-1197-1 is not to be manipulated at any time outside of testing.

**Description:** SCP-1197 is hotel suite ███ in [REDACTED], containing a bedroom area, bathroom, and typical furnishings including a television, mini-fridge, and telephone. The windows on the far wall of the bedroom cannot be opened or broken by any known means. When viewed from through the windows from outside SCP-1197 appears empty and undisturbed despite any occupants.

SCP-1197 can be occupied for any amount of time and freely vacated, provided the occupant does not open SCP-1197-1. SCP-1197-1 is a doorway in the western wall of SCP-1197. Although it appears to connect to the adjacent suite, the corresponding door in room ███ cannot be opened. SCP-1197-1 remains locked unless the entrance door to SCP-1197 is closed.

Opening SCP-1197-1 will reveal an identical version of SCP-1197 and a duplicate of any current occupants, who have opened their version of SCP-1197-1 at the same moment. Duplicates have exhibited accurate knowledge in response to questions of identity, and act in a similar manner. Posthumous testing reveals no biological discrepancies.

SCP-1197 has demonstrated the ability to spawn items during an active session, out of view of any occupants. Utilities, with the exception of the telephone, continue to function, but occasionally experience outages.

During an active session the entrance door to SCP-1197 will no longer open and cannot be breached from either side. Should 1 instance of each occupant expire, SCP-1197-1 will close and the entrance door will open. To date all recorded deaths within SCP-1197 have resulted from homicide.

**Addendum:**
Note: The Foundation became aware of SCP-1197 4 days into Incident 1197/3. Interviews with hotel staff and local authorities provided information regarding previous incidents.

> **Subject:** █████ ████████
> **Duration:** Approximately 16 hours
> Subject failed to check out of SCP-1197. Hotel staff could not open door, authorities notified. Before police arrived subject exited SCP-1197, appearing distressed and acting violently towards anyone approaching him. A battered body similar in appearance to the subject was discovered in SCP-1197. Subject arrested and interrogated before committing suicide in police custody.
> 
> Interrogation logs provided rough details of an SCP-1197 active session, during which the subject accused his duplicate of lying about his identity, denied the reality of the situation, and attempted escape. Eventually the subject subdued and tortured his duplicate to gain additional information and/or freedom. Duplicate expired from inflicted injuries, at which point SCP-1197-1 closed and the entrance door opened. Posthumous DNA testing revealed a match between the subject and body.

> **Subject:** ███████ ████████
> **Duration:** Unknown
> A body matching the subject was found in SCP-1197 by cleaning staff at approximately 12:15pm the day after the subject checked in. A police investigation determined the cause of death to be asphyxiation using a leather belt matching the one worn by the victim. Time of death estimated at 9:30am. Hotel security video and front desk logs show subject exiting room and checking out at 9:37am. Subject's current location unknown.

> **Subject:** ██████ and ████████ ████
> **Duration:** Approximately 45 days
> Before the Foundation could secure the site subject-1 (male) and subject-2 (female) activated SCP-1197. On-site personnel responded to the re-opening of SCP-1197 to discover subject-1 assaulting subject-2. Subject-1 detained, subject-2 transported to nearest hospital under guard.
> 
> Interview reveals subjects to be a married couple. Subject-1 opened SCP-1197-1 while unpacking, discovering duplicate subjects. After a few hours of panic and argument both instances of subject-2 were able to calm their husbands and all 4 agreed to rest and await rescue. The duplicate subject-2 discovered wrapped sandwiches in their mini-fridge which hadn't been there previously, sharing them amongst all 4 subjects. The fridge replenished every day at first, but gradually produced food less and less frequently. Over the following weeks tension grew between the couples until they decided to keep SCP-1197-1 closed and check in daily.
> 
> Eventually the duplicate couple claimed the fridge ceased producing food, resulting in a violent altercation, after which SCP-1197-1 was closed and barricaded from both sides. Several days later subject-1 awoke to find subject-2 missing. Forcing SCP-1197-1 open subject-1 discovered his duplicate in bed with both instances of subject-2. All 3 claimed innocence to accusations of infidelity. Subject-1 assaulted his duplicate, leading to the death of 1 instance of both subjects. SCP-1197-1 closed and entrance door opened. 2 bodies were recovered for study. Subject-2 expired from injuries before being interviewed.

> **Subject:** D-1916, a 28yr. old male convicted of a gang-related homicide
> **Duration:** Approximately 9 days
> D-1916 instructed to enter SCP-1197, wait until the entrance door was closed and open SCP-1197-1. Upon exiting SCP-1197 D-1916 attempted to escape the hotel before being detained.
> 
> Subject described meeting his duplicate and exchanging questions until both accepted their situation. D-1916 and duplicate attempted escape, but were unable to breach doors and windows, or contact anyone via telephone. Over the next week increasingly elaborate plans were enacted but all met with failure as various utilities such as power, water, and air conditioning began failing for long periods. Arguing intensified until D-1916 discovered an electric iron in the closet and bludgeoned his duplicate to death. SCP-1197-1 closed and the entrance door opened. Body and iron recovered for study.

> **Subject:** D-985, a 24yr. old male convicted of three related homicides
> **Duration:** 5 minutes
> D-985 armed with a loaded pistol and fully informed about the nature of SCP-1197. D-985 instructed to enter SCP-1197, wait until the entrance door was closed and open SCP-1197-1. Entrance door opened minutes later, revealing D-985 leaning against armchair with a gunshot wound in the side, facing a closed SCP-1197-1. D-985 ordered by armed personnel to drop pistol and lay face down. D-985 complied.
> 
> D-985 described opening SCP-1197-1 and being shot before returning fire and presumably terminating his duplicate. Personnel report not hearing any gunshots or other noises from SCP-1197 until entrance door re-opened. D-985 escorted from SCP-1197 and treated by medical personnel.

A single pistol was found on the floor which had not been issued to the subject. D-5482, body and pistol removed from SCP-1197. D-5482 was calm and refused to describe her experience, explaining only that she had "dealt with her issues."
