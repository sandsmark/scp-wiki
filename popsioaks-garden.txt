Top of the morning, Popsioak here, in all my popsicly, oaky, glory. 

I've got uh, articles I guess. Written by a sikh guy. So yeah. That's cool.
I write a lot, evidently.

I can give a mean sikh history lecture.

This is probably the weirdest skip of mine. Like, no filter, I wrote this during a trip to India, where I was in a bit of a funk. J.R. Swalls is as close to a self insert as I can get during that time. Looking back at it, it’s pretty damn simple as an article. It’s depressing music. But really, what I attempted to do with it was to just reflect how people dealt with grief. Some get angry, some go crazy, some eat up all their emotion till there’s plumb nothing left. And all of those are ok. Those kinda feelings aren’t bad.

Only problem is, the dialogue suffers poorly. Perhaps a time of emotional stress wasn’t the best time to be er, penning an article.

This article was born the way all great articles are, of course. During physical exertion. I’ve always imagined while running laps around the high school’s track (not that I’m //slow// or anything, I’m pretty damn fast, doin a mile in like, 6 and a half minutes, doesn’t mean I have to LIKE doing it, but i digress) that I could finish that shit super fast. There’s the obvious method of super speed like good old Barry Allen, but then, it hit me: time travel. This was my first ever SCP, and I’d honestly have to hand it to [[*user Brewsterion 1017]] and [[*user Doctor Cimmerian]] for helping me BRAINSTORM this while I was fresh into SCPD. Thanks guys, cause it’s you dudes who kickstarted my writing.

> //After the GLADYS event of 2001/09/11, SCP-4186 ceased all actions for 3 months. SCP-4186 released a single letter on 2001/12/30, before expelling smoke and spent bullet casings. It then dissipated. SCP-4186 has not condensed again.//

Now this... this is interesting. For those of you who didn’t know, my grandpa has a form of dementia called Dementia with Lewy Bodies, meaning he quite often forgets stuff, gets hallucinations, etc. etc. There was a day where he asked me how to send messages through the cloud, and lo and behold, we’ve made an SCP! I wanted to make it Neutralized somehow, and I thought what better way than making the person whose mailbox it is, DEAD! And being a Coldest War nut, I had to slip in the pseudo-reference.


The fact it’s my shortest is interesting. What’s even more interesting is my attempt to convey a story through a table of Amazon package contents.

~~also GLADYS events are shitty callouts to chance the rapper~~

> SCP-4187-1 is a hostile, nocturnal entity that resembles a Burger King roadside sign. ... It then extends a thin, vascular appendage from the blue circle of the sign, which it uses to puncture the victim's brain... The appendage then exsanguinates the prey... SCP-4187-1 lifts its victim up and places it in a set of jaws that extends from the two "buns" on the sign. SCP-4187-1 then devours the victim, before wiping its "jaws" with the appendage, releasing a noise measuring at 110 decibels. 

I have to admit. I’ve got to come clean. This thing was half inspired by a Yu-Gi-Oh! card and half inspired by number 15: burger king yadda yadda. But, the idea of a roadside sign that appears outside pastures to feed was really tempting. And then the spiral spun deeper and deeper: what if it ate nightly? Wouldn’t that mean it’d run out of beef? What if it had to turn to... //other// meats? Is the sign alive, or is the entire restaurant a massive larva? 

This is probably one of the ones I’m most proud of, simply due to the imagery I had to work on for it, especially towards the beginning.

I... I am pretty sure this was a joke. At least a joke idea from [[*user Weryllium]]. It’s spawned something much greater than itself, hopefully a ton of sequels and even a squid squad discord. I am honestly most proud of this skip for how well it’s doing, for something as batshit insane as “squids in a fucking tank."
Long live the squad. The Squad may live forever.
