This was the second ever thing that I've submitted to the site, and I am honestly really proud of it. I couldn't have ever completed this one without getting plenty of support and encouragement from [[*user Uncle Nicolini]], who supported me all the way until it was posted.

The idea behind this was pretty simple at first, I just wanted to make a movie projector that would show creepy things. I was told that the concept was pretty good, but needed more to it. Making SCP-3407 was like putting pieces into a puzzle together; I slowly made a story that I was proud of.

I was actually a bit worried before posting that the article was bad, and I almost scrapped it entirely out of fear that it would fail. Gosh, am I glad I didn't do that. I remember trying to rework the concept into a guy who had a movie projector for a head, but I figured that what I had at the moment was good enough.

The rating isn't too great, but I'm still proud of myself for making this. I'm currently planning on rewriting this article, so the commentary here will probably change in the future.

I came up with the idea for this article by just eating grapes lol. I also was thinking about the old midwives tale of 'If you eat the seeds, it'll grow inside of you!' so I decided to write an article about that. Then this happened, a species of grapes that turns you into a grapes salesperson.

I also came up with my own minor GoI for this one called 'Dawn Farm and Ranch.' Their basic philosophy is to create healthy, lightly genetically modified anomalous food. It isn't just limited to fruits of veggies either, it can include meat, dairy, etc. I don't think that old Dawn will ever become an official Group of Interest, but one can dream, right?

I currently consider this to be the best article that I've ever written. This was a collaboration project between me and [[*user Uncle Nicolini]] and I couldn't have done it without him.

To put it simply, this is a story all about a sapient pink rose that just wants to make the world a better place, even if it deprives her of her own happiness. We were aiming to make this an emotional, bittersweet kind of article, and I definitely think it hits the mark.

We went through a ton of ideas for this piece, this really just started off as a garden that made you happy. One of the critics for the piece though that was kinda lame though, so I got inspiration for //'The Queen of Roses'// after looking at my rose bush while I was doing some yard work.

Ah yes, [http://www.scp-wiki.net/wilson-s-wildlife-solutions-hub Wilson's Wildlife Solutions], such a charming Group of Interest. I remember first reading about WWS when I found an article called [http://www.scp-wiki.net/critter-profile-sampson Critter Profile: Sampson!] and having no clue what I was reading. Searched up the hub page, and I fell in love with the GoI on the spot.

Then this little guy came into fruition. I wanted to write a GoI format really badly, so I decided to use one of my favorite animals; a Kangaroo! I decided to name the fellow 'Ringo' after a cat that I used to have.

Of course, I figured that since this Kangaroo was crazy dangerous and could be used to destroy cities, I figured that the Chaos Insurgency would want to 'utilize' him so to speak. I thought that it would make for an empathic article that could definitely bum someone out.
