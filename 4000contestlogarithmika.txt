**Item #:** SCP-4000

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** All journals of mathematics and philosophy are to be screened by automated proof checking software to find instances of SCP-4000, focusing on articles regarding long-standing conjectures or disputed results, and articles that contradict previously established results. All instances of SCP-4000 found are to be censored and the corresponding papers retracted.

A document detailing the logic steps involved in SCP-4000 is to be stored in a High-Value Item Vault at Storage Site-1313. To reduce accidental exposure to potential memetic hazards, the document is to use symbolic logic represented using reverse Polish notation to obfuscate readability, and no written descriptions or explanations. An additional copy of this information is in the possession of the Foundation's Memetics Department, as it is an essential component of Fae-class suggestibility agents.

The original proof of Fermat's Last Theorem by Sophie Germain has been suppressed from the public record and replaced by the sanitized version released by herself later; no further action is required in this regard. The original documents regarding this proof and Germain's discovery of SCP-4000 are stored in a different High-Value Item Vault at Storage Site-33; this includes the letters written by Germain to prominent public figures during this period.

**Description:** SCP-4000 refers to a proof method or syllogism, referred to as //modus adductus//, discovered by French mathematician Marie-Sophie Germain in the year 1804 during the process of devising a proof for Fermat's Last Theorem. //Modus adductus//, like similar methods such as //modus ponens// or //modus tollens//, consists of a series of steps to show that a statement is a consequence of other previously accepted statements. However, SCP-4000's anomalous effect lies in the fact that any statement deemed as a consequence of another via the use of //modus adductus// is accepted as true by anyone capable of understanding the logical steps involved, regardless of the actual relation between the two statements.

A syllogism is a logical argument that asserts the truth of a statement, by deduction, from other statements or premises accepted as true, either absolutely or conditionally. A syllogism usually takes the form of a list of premises, interspersed with the usage of inference rules (which show certain statements to be consequence of other, previously accepted ones), in order to arrive at the desired conclusion; for instance, the //modus ponens// syllogism has the following schema:

> **Premise 1:** A is true.
> **Premise 2:** If A is true, then B is also true.
> ------
> **Conclusion:** B is also true.

The following is a correct application of this syllogism:

> **Premise 1:** [[[SCP-2558-J| Cartman]]] is a calico cat.
> **Premise 2:** All calico cats are female.
> ------
> **Conclusion:** Cartman is female.

While the premises may have a disputable level of truth[[footnote]] While most calico cats are female, genetic ailments such as Klinefelter syndrome may result in cats with a Y chromosome exhibiting calico patterns. [[/footnote]], if we accept them as true (a cat being a calico, and calicos being female) then by the principles of deductive reasoning the conclusion must also be accepted as true (i.e. we understand that this specific cat is female).

Not all forms of deductive reasoning are true, however. Common examples of faulty logical arguments include the following:

* confusing observable correlation with logical causation,
* swapping antecedent and consequent, i.e. taking "if A then B" as a premise and then assuming that, since B is true A must be true as well,
* usage of contradictory premises,
* using the same word with different meanings to arrive to the desired conclusion.

The first two types of fallacies from the above list may be observed in the following example:

> **Premise 1:** Reality bending entities are able to alter the documentation of SCP objects.
> **Premise 2:** Doctor Fred has altered the documentation of SCP-7160.
> ------
> **Conclusion:** Doctor Fred is a reality bending entity.

While both premises are true, it does not follow that a person who is able to make edits to the SCP Foundation database is a reality bending entity. An extreme example of this is the //reductio ad hitlerum// argument, where a statement is deemed as false, harmful or otherwise dismissed by association with a person, entity, organization, etc., which is deemed nocive in some way.

SCP-4000, as verified by proof checking software and Foundation AICs, is effectively a fallacy similar to the aforementioned ones. However, when interpreted by the human brain, it is understood as a compelling, valid argument to derive the conclusion statement from the premises, without regard as to whether there is any actual relation between them. Thus, a reasoning like the one quoted below would be perceived as perfectly logical by somebody affected by SCP-4000:

> **Premise 1:** Cats are common household pets.
> **Premise 2:** Fennec foxes have been raised as household pets in the past.
> **Premise 3:** [MEMETIC HAZARD REDACTED]
> ------
> **Conclusion:** Cats and fennec foxes are the same species of animal.

Of note is that, while SCP-4000 is seen as a correct syllogism, it does not enforce belief in the conclusive statement. Thus, if the latter contradicts personal belief or convictions, often the affected look for errors in the premises taken, or other formal or functional mistakes to justify their cognitive dissonance. However, research by the Foundation shows that if the person exposed to SCP-4000 has no strong convictions on the discussed topic, or is otherwise open to the idea of themselves being in the wrong stance, correct usage of SCP-4000 combined with usual argumentation and persuasion techniques results in a belief change in 75%-85% of studied cases.

**Addendum 4000-1:** Historical Notes

The first known instance of SCP-4000 was found in a letter written by Germain to fellow mathematician Karl Friedrich Gauss in 1804 detailing a proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. Gauss' reply[[footnote]] The original reply has been removed from the public record and replaced by a forgery. [[/footnote]] stated that, while he could not find any errors in Germain's proof, an intermediate step seemed to contradict a result proved by himself two years earlier. Following correspondence[[footnote]] Also censored. [[/footnote]] consisted of joint efforts by Germain and Gauss to find a mistake in either Germain's proof or Gauss' work, with no results. Eventually, Germain managed to isolate the problematic section of the proof and deduced the nature of SCP-4000; this was later corroborated by experimentation on Germain's part, by sending purposefully incorrect proofs (usually of nonsensical statements) to several prominent mathematicians such as Joseph-Louis Lagrange and Adrien-Marie Legendre, under various pseudonyms. While a few of the replies received pointed out that there might be an error in her work, none of them pointed to the SCP-4000 proof as faulty, instead citing false assumptions or mentioning potential new theories to explain the unexpected results.

Germain's notes contain extensive studies on SCP-4000 and its effect on human reasoning, along with philosophical notes regarding truth in mathematics and human knowledge; in these notes it is explicitly stated that understanding the logical steps involved is necessary in order for SCP-4000 to take effect. The framework set by Germain's work was a fundamental part of the early study of memetics, and in particular SCP-4000 is registered as the first recognized and studied anomalous meme in the Foundation's record.

The following notes have been extracted from private notebooks, diaries and notes written on the margins of correspondence drafted or received by Sophie Germain between 1804 and 1809. They have been translated from the original French; the originals are archived as Documents 4000-A109 through 4000-A147.

> //Seeking out the errors in my work on Fermat's problem has been exceedingly difficult. While it may be just personal pride, I just cannot look at my writings and see anything less that a sound argument. The great Fermat's unfinished work, concluded by the pen of Sophie Germain! But at the same time, holding on to that thought is denying Gauss' expertise and skill. I have reproduced his proof step-by-step, several times, and I haven't found anything remotely resembling a mistake; the error must be in my work, and, although this is extremely frustrating, I must discover it.//

Most of Germain's notes regarding SCP-4000 were never published, and her proof of Fermat's Last Theorem was retracted and replaced by a weaker version in a letter to Gauss from 1809. There is only one known instance of public SCP-4000 usage by Germain besides the aforementioned experimental letters, in which Germain wrote a letter intended to be read by Napoleon Bonaparte regarding the occupation of Braunschweig[[footnote]] Prussian town where Gauss lived. It is known that Germain was familiar with the story of Archimedes, who was killed in the siege of Syracuse by the invading forces, and feared for Gauss' life. [[/footnote]] by French forces. In this letter, written in colloquial language but following the SCP-4000 structure, Germain stated the importance of protecting men of science and arts, and pleaded for Napoleon to avoid needless killing in the invasion. It is suspected that Napoleon's amateur interest in mathematics[[footnote]] There is at least one mathematical result attributed to Napoleon (in the field of Euclidean geometry), although this claim is often disputed. [[/footnote]] was enough for him to be susceptible to SCP-4000; however, it is unknown if the letter was actually read by him. It is known that Napoleon's policies regarding occupation of cities had a change around this period and that a squad of French soldiers was tasked with checking on Gauss' well-being during the occupation, facts that suggest that Napoleon did indeed receive the letter. However, the fact that General Pernetti, the leader of the squad, was known as a family friend of Sophie Germain allows for reasonable doubt to be held.

**Addendum 4000-2:** Relevant data obtained from the Alexandria Agreements

After signing the Alexandria Agreements, a treaty between the Foundation and the Global Occult Coalition in order to share relevant historical data about anomalies, several pamphlets and propaganda posters dated from 1941 to 1943 were delivered to the Foundation for analysis and deemed to contain a form of SCP-4000, as an attempt to increase adherence and loyalty to the Third Reich. These posters were traced to German mathematician Oswald Teichmüller, known for its allegiance to the NSDAP.

As predicted by Germain, this propaganda had a very low success rate. However, it has prompted investigation in a joint Foundation-GOC effort to look for other instances of public usage of SCP-4000-like propaganda agents. So far, the following evidence has been found:

* Internal memorandums (dated 1961-1967) declassified by the United States' Central Intelligence Agency detailing the support given to the "New Math" project to completely overhaul the mathematics curriculum in elementary schools, in order to introduce the basics of logic, set theory and other abstract areas of mathematics at an early age; these documents mention plans to implement a unspecified "propaganda construct", presumed to be SCP-4000. These plans appear to have been abandoned after the failure of the New Math project.
* Several documents from the USSR's GRU Division "P" regarding proposals to use SCP-4000-like constructs as part of larger-scale projects. Most of them were denied due to the (at the time) recent discovery of better memetic agents for the desired purposes.
* Abnormalities detected in the mathematics curriculum of China, flagged as possibly related to SCP-4000 by automated statistical analysis. However, no actual evidence of SCP-4000 usage has been found.

Containment procedures for SCP-4000 are currently undergoing revision to take into account the detection and suppression of further attempts to use SCP-4000 by civilian governments.
