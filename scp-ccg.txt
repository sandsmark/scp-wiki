Thank you.

Please note that these rules are currently under construction so please bare with them and highlight any errors you can find in sections not marked //INCOMPLETE//.

Please note that this game is being created to be marketable to people outside of the wiki so suggestions for ease of play or clearer wordings are much appreciated but complaints that the game is too kiddyfied help no-one unless you have acctual proof the simplicity harms the game.

This page will also be used as the Rule referance document for the duration of the game's development and life. Please treat it as such and keep edits to a minimum. Also there will be sections that aren't needed to be completed until the game is in a presentable state but they will be added here for sake of completeness.

Please feel free to suggest ideas for set names. The idea is that the 90 card sets advance the metaplot whereas the 45 card sets are for side events and alternate realities the final set will flesh out any mechanics that need finishing and end the metaplot.

Please make and discussion relevant to the CCG rather than getting off topic and if people want to discuss the SCP-CCG in the chat I usually create #SCP-CCG whenever I'm working on the game and will be happy to answer any questions on it.
