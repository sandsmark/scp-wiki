------

Please note that these rules are currently under construction so please bear with them and highlight any errors you can find in sections not marked //INCOMPLETE//.

Please note that this game is being created to be marketable to people outside of the wiki so suggestions for ease of play or clearer wordings are much appreciated but complaints that the game is too kiddy-fied help no-one unless you have actual proof the simplicity harms the game.

This page will also be used as the Rule reference document for the duration of the game's development and life. Please treat it as such and keep edits to a minimum. Also there will be sections that aren't needed to be completed until the game is in a presentable state but they will be added here for sake of completeness.

[[[CCG Section 1]]]: General Rules and Game Setup
[[[CCG Section 2]]]: The Cards //INCOMPLETE//
[[[CCG Section 3]]]: Game Rules //INCOMPLETE//
[[[CCG Section 4]]]: Abilities and Card Text //INCOMPLETE//
[[[CCG Section 5]]]: Additional Rules //INCOMPLETE//

Current Status:
Rules: Streamlined and reworded with some card types moved to future expansions.

Demo Decks: Due to an overhaul of the power level of the game the new Demo Decks will be available shortly they will consist of the following:

Deck #1: [[[Dr. Gears Mechanical Monsters.]]] Which utilises Mechanical SCPs to control your opponent's game and slowly lock them down.
Deck #2: [[[Alto Clef's Guide to Decommisioning.]]] Which blows SCPs the fuck up rather than containing them.
Deck #3: [[[Dr. Coleman's Methodical Logic.]]] Which uses deck manipulation to control the tempo of the game.
Deck #4: [[[Dr. Bright's Happy Times.]]] Which controls Personnel through various means to snatch a quick win.
