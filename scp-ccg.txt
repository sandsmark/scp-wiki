title:SCP-CCG
I know there's currently an SCP TCG page but this version of the game takes a totally different direction in play. I hope no one is annoyed by me posting this up.

Please note that these rules are currently under construction so please bare with them and highlight any errors you can find in sections not marked //INCOMPLETE//.

Please note that this game is being created to be marketable to people outside of the wiki so suggestions for ease of play or clearer wordings are much appreciated but complaints that the game is too kiddyfied help no-one unless you have acctual proof the simplicity harms the game.

This page will also be used as the Rule referance document for the duration of the game's development and life. Please treat it as such and keep edits to a minimum. Also there will be sections that aren't needed to be completed until the game is in a presentable state but they will be added here for sake of completeness.

**Basic Game Information:**
Each player represents an O5 level person who is attempting to secure SCPs as they appear around the world while gaining funding over their opponents. This game is designed to be played with 2-6 players but can support more or even solitare play if needed.

The game will be like the wiki and will be an ongoing storyline which, I hope, will expand and evolve as players suggest things and play. Please note that the CCG will divert from the wiki metaplot so don't expect things to be the same. There will be a 180 card basic set followed by 6 90 card sets and 6 45 card sets which alternate in size and a final 180 card set. In total there will be 1170 cards in the sets along with 30 cards created as and when needed.

If the game becomes popular enough I have the facilities to print sets of the cards at a professional standard and distrobute them to interested parties.

Each player will need the following to play:
* A Deck of a minimum 40 cards and a maximum of 40+10 for each other player in the game.
* A 10 card Deck of SCPs.
* A shedload of tokens. Sorry for this but it seems to be the best way to play the game.

+++ Overview of play.

Your goal is to have the largest number of SCPs Contained when the game ends. You do this by playing Personel, Gear, Resources and Finances before attempting to secure the unsecured SCPs that are in play and containing them. You can also attempt to sabotage your opponents attempts to secure and contain SCPs through the use of various Complications and Missions.

In the following sections you will find examples of how all of these things can happen and each card type explored in detail and how they can help you win the game. If you haven't played before please use one of the suggested decklists before creating your own deck as these should give you a better idea of what the game has to offer.

++++ Setting up the Game.

Each player puts their SCP deck into a pile with all the other player's SCP decks and shuffles them together in a pile in the center of the table. Each player then shuffles their deck and places it to their left and takes 5 tokens and places them in their resource pool. (see the layout example if not sure)

Each player then bids to go first. The player with the highest bid removes that many cards from the top of their deck and will be Player 1. Each player draws 6 cards and play starts from Player 1 and proceeds clockwise from them.

------

++Turn Sequence 
Each Player's turn consists of the following phases:
# Manditory Start of Turn Phase
# Optional Start of Turn Phase (Optional)
