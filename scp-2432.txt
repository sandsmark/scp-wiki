**Item #:** SCP-2432

**Object Class:**  Dov

**Special Containment Procedures:** All business and travel websites with listings for the A██████ Hotel are to be monitored for reviews displaying memetic triggers by Foundation-operated web analysis bot Gamma-09 ("BEARTESMOTEL"), which will scan for a list of memetic textual triggers and remove the reviews with the cooperation of the hosting sites. Only staff members with Level 3 memetic hazard training are to have access to these texts. 

SCP-2432-1 is to be kept in storage in a small sealed plastic box to prevent biohazard contamination. As of █/█/15, sufficient data has been produced such that no more testing with SCP-2432-1 is required, and it is to be kept in storage permanently.

The A██████ Hotel has been purchased by a Foundation front company, and no non-Foundation personnel are to enter SCP-2432, excepting appointed hotel cleaning staff. 

--One D-Class is to check into and sleep in SCP-2432 once every month. They are then to be isolated with one computer. This computer is only to have access to a private Foundation database, made to resemble popular business review sites. The contents generated by the D-Class are to be placed in a secure file accessible via this documentation containing all text generated in conjunction with SCP-2432.--

**Update █/██/18:** No personnel are to sleep in SCP-2432 under any circumstances. All surviving personnel are to be immediately quarantined until 1/8/19 at Zoological Containment Site-282 alongside instances of [[[SCP-2579]]]. They are to be housed in a large containment enclosure that adequately emulates a Pacific Northwestern forest. Food is to be placed in the enclosure twice a day.
Under Protocol BALOO, all civilians who have had contact with SCP-2432 before containment are to be contacted, monitored, and quarantined until 1/8/19. All nonessential testing is to cease. Upgrade to Keter pending. 

**Description:** SCP-2432 is Room 710 of the A██████ Hotel in Denali National Park, Alaska. SCP-2432 is similar to most rooms within the A██████ Hotel, with two queen-sized beds, closet, television and bathroom, all non-anomalous elements in and of themselves. The interior of SCP-2432's walls are lined with a brown, organic, woven fur-like substance that is extremely tough, with a tensile strength of close to 4003 MPa. No other walls in the A██████ Hotel have been shown to contain this fur.

SCP-2432's construction is designed in a way to induce a mind-altering effect on a guest, hereafter designated Subject, who sleeps overnight in SCP-2432. The walls of SCP-2432 can generate an oscillation that manipulates ursine brainwaves through an unknown process. This oscillation places subjects sleeping in SCP-2432 into a trance. Upon leaving, subjects are compelled to write a review of the A██████ Hotel on a popular travel or business review site. Occasionally, subjects will write reviews of the A██████ Hotel on wildlife forums. The current reason for this is unknown

The subject's experience will often be highly exaggerated, with praise for the various services and amenities provided by SCP-2432. Reviews will often be written in bearly coherent language, with frequent nonsensical or cryptic sentences. Subjects describe having no memories of writing each review.

The reviews generated by subjects have a minor textual memetic property of varying strength. Any individual who reads a generated review will feel a desire to travel to Denali National Park and book SCP-2432 for an overnight stay. The most powerful memetic triggers have caused a 62% increase in bookings at the A██████ Hotel.

> **Text:** Another great hibernation in this fabulous hotel!  The room was perfect, the staff barbearic as always, and of course no better location than on the plane of many dens. I have enjoyed a drink at the friendly bar, this time I added a wonderful escape from angry bears and the breakfast was salmon and the breakfast was honey. Another great hibernation in this fabulous hotel! The restaurant has lovely ambiance and the food was over the top alive and swimming upstream into my mouth woo! Would stifle again. My husband eats out often and felt this was the best one ever. Another great stay in this fabulous hotel! One more great item to add to the A██████. Another great hibernation in this fabulous hotel! Stayed July 1999, traveled with our whole litter of cubs.

> **Text:** We sailed on our boat into Denali from outside Denali through the night and the cold and arrived at 8am in Denali.  The hotel desk staff allowed us to check in at 8am in the evening with our sixty four young cubs - this was absolutely BEARABLE bearable customer service!  We cannot thank you enough for allowing us to check in so early in State College. Earlier then hibernation. The rest of the stay was fine - we spent almost all of our time in the room; mostly just to sleep. 
> This location is ultra ultra convenient with the middle of a field in Denali and allowed me to make a midnight run for some of my favorite Denali salmon while the family was sleeping and sleeping and sleeping and sleeeeping in Denali.

> **Text:** Bear with me on this one. Been coming to this region for two hundred and twenty kilograms. What a blast. Scores of salmon wondering the streets and staffing the hotel. My husband and my husband and I have lumbered drooling path to get here. Bed in Room 710 was soft and cosy and appreciated the decor would recommend the bed and specifically the bed and specifically the bed. [TRIGGER REDACTED] in the river and it was lovely, crisp blue hydrogen and you could see all of the salmon relax into a meandering menace because bears were chasing them. Towel slightly dirty with dung. Gym was full of usable equipment, so you could train not in fear of bears. And the local wildlife was remarkable. I visited the town in the past and have never seen so much salmon being feasted on [TRIGGER REDACTED] and the male grizzlies were especially numerous today. Arrived July 2019, staying three days months ten years.

SCP-2432-1 is a small organic nodule, resembling a boil, located on the back of the otherwise normal LG brand HD flat-screen television located in SCP-2432. Samples from the fluid inside show a mixture of human, salmon and unidentified ursine DNA. This nodule is stuck to the television with an adhesive mucus it generates, though it can be removed safely and easily.

When SCP-2432-1 is placed on the back of SCP-2432's television, in addition to the standard extended satellite channel package found in other televisions throughout the A██████ Hotel, an additional television channel labeled as "bearnews" is accessible. No other television throughout the A██████ Hotel, or any television brought into SCP-2432 has access to "bearnews" aside from the room's original. "bearsnews" can only be accessed by placing SCP-2432-1 on SCP-2432's television. Attaching SCP-2432-1 to any other television set yields no effect. The nature of the relationship between the set, SCP-2432-1, and SCP-2432 is unknown.

The bare facts about apparent programming on "bearnews" is that it consists of one 24-hour untitled show. The content of this show is a single still photograph of a pastoral Yukon River scene with spawning salmon and numerous berry bushes, while a muzak version of the Disney song //The Bare Necessities// by Phil Harris plays on repeat. Once every three days, the audio is interrupted while an unidentified male voice with a Alaskan accent reads a dramatic monologue addressed to the viewer, interrupted with apparent grunting and chuffing. Contents of the monologue are similar to reviews generated by subjects and deal with exaggerated praise for the hotel, its amenities, and the lifestyle that wild grizzly bears lead. The monologue, unlike the reviews, is bearable to listen to, and contains bearly any memetic triggers, although 13% of subjects who viewed the monologue under controlled conditions describe feeling mildly disturbed or discomforted. If SCP-2432-1 has been removed, placing it back on SCP-2432's television will immediately begin broadcast of a monologue. The cycle will then begin again, with the next monologue broadcasting three days later if not removed.

SCP-2432 first appeared on 6/7/99, when the A██████ Hotel first switched from cable to satellite television. Before this, hotel administration had no record of a Room 710 existing.

> **Monologue recorded during test with SCP-2432-1 on █/██/14:**
> 
> Let me describe something to you. This is a true story. It really happened to me. It could have happened to you.
> 
> Every day you wake up and you go to your den and there’s just something off about the alpha bear, he’s really aggressive because he keeps wanting to mate with the bear that you have chosen. It's more than you can bear. You get in a fight with him and then get bored, defecate, and go stand in the river and catch salmon. And you should love catching salmon. It’s your passion. Most would die to be catching salmon they are passionate about eating. Lovely tasty salmon. You really should but you can’t. Wonder becomes routine and routine becomes drudgery and it’s day in and day out and it's an unbearable struggle to maintain your soul. This is not what should happen. GRAAAAAGH
> 
> 'GRAAAAAGH' is such a tormenting word. A thinking trap. GRAAAAAGH. Your life is ruled by GRAAAAAGHs.
> 
> You amble home by the river. Everything is along that main drag and you cannot really go elsewhere. Everything is overcast and it's been raining and the river is swollen you can't catch fishand the squirrels are idiots and the foxes are too. You get home to your den you defecate quite a lot because you ate so much honey. 
> 
> What I recommend to you is simple: Find a hotel. Not a motel or something shabby. A hotel. Even a chain will do.
> 
> Hotels are simply remarkable, aren’t they? Clean and elegant. All modernistic and designed to appeal to the eye. You don’t need to care about a thing in the world. Food is provided, they clean up after you and you can feel like you have some luxury for once. Wander around the corridors and eat all the people who are there because they are afraid of you. Nonsense. Who would be afraid of a bear?
>
> 
> Take a look at the humans around you. Travelers, most. Strange people, interesting people. People you won’t ever see again because you ate them. Being a bear is so romantic, so mysterious. Don’t listen to the naysayers. These people all love bears. You know they do. 
> 
> The room is amazing. The wallpaper is elegant and the paintings make you feel at ease. There are clean towels every day and the bed is freshly made so you can defecate all over them. No foxes. Endless salmon, endless berries, endless honey. You can mate with all the other bears. Be at peace and hibernate for six months and get really fat.
> 
> Isn’t that bearable?
> 
> (//Ursine growling, roaring and chuffing for the remainder of the broadcast.//)

**Addendum:** On █/██/17 D-3456, who had participated in sleep studies involving SCP-2432, contracted an unknown illness while working with SCP-████. Initially ruled to be related to SCP-████, he was placed in quarantine. 

During examination, medical officers found brown fur growing on the subject. Subject was also gaining a considerable amount of weight, upwards of 600 pounds, and began to enquire as to the location of the nearest river. Subject was observed to sleep for upwards of a week during this time. After a week, subject shed all clothes, preferring to go around bare. After a month, subject's nose began to develop into a snout, and was found on a beach hunting for clams following an escape during a containment breach. Subject compulsively flirted with female members of staff by asking "What's ursine?"

Within the next thirty days, five more D-Class and one researcher who were involved with testing on SCP-2432 developed similar symptoms and were immediately quarantined. All have met a grizzly fate. It is currently at a level that is more than the Foundation can bear. The disease was ruled to be connected to SCP-2432. All testing ceased.
