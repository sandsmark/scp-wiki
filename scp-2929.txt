**Item #:** SCP-2929

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2929 is located in Foundation-operated Katavi National Park, control of which has been negotiated from the Tanzanian government.  A perimeter of two kilometers is to be maintained around SCP-2929 and civilian access is to be prohibited.  Any and all trespassers are to be detained, interrogated, administered appropriate amnestics, and released at the discretion of acting personnel.

Locals familiar with SCP-2929 have been amnesticized.  Because the locals had no intention to make knowledge of SCP-2929 known to outsiders, further suppression of information is unnecessary.

A 200-meter-high enclosure has been constructed at a perimeter of 10 meters and disguised as a radio tower.  Foundation operatives are to consistently monitor and edit satellite photographs of SCP-2929 and its enclosure.  The enclosure with all associated machinery and all supports are to be checked for damage on a monthly basis and repaired in a timely manner.

No personnel are permitted to make physical contact with the exposed face of SCP-2929.  All movements made by SCP-2929 are to be observed and recorded by on-site mathematicians and linguists fluent in ancient and modern forms of Khoisan languages.  Any attempts made by SCP-2929-1 to communicate are to be reported to the acting Level 3 supervisor.  Transmissions directed at SCP-2929-1 must be supervised by personnel of Level 3 Clearance or higher.

**Description:** SCP-2929 is a perfectly cylindrical column of what appears to be indestructible pure obsidian extending from the lower mantle of the Earth to above the crust, about three meters higher than the surrounding ground[[footnote]]About 9██ meters above sea level.[[/footnote]].  It is located at 6°50'██"S, 31°15'██"E in Katavi National Park, Mpanda District, Tanzania.  The column is oriented to point directly toward the Earth's center of mass.  SCP-2929 has a consistent diameter of approximately 82.22 meters[[footnote]]Exactly 144 //ohra//, a pre-colonial Tanzanian unit of length equivalent to about 0.571 meters.  Of note is that the number 144 is 2^7 plus 2^4, as well as 12^2.[[/footnote]] and, according to readings from experimental gamma ray imaging (GRI) techniques, is approximately 2844.00 kilometers[[footnote]]Exactly 4,980,736 //ohra//.  Of note is that the number 4,980,736 is 2^22 plus 2^19.[[/footnote]] long.

The two faces of SCP-2929 are in a perpetual state of motion and cannot be manipulated externally.  GRI readings show that movements made on one face are made in tandem with movements on the other face, but inverted.  For example, if a one centimeter cube indent presents itself on one side, then a one centimeter cube protrusion will present itself in the corresponding location on the opposite face simultaneously.

Therefore, SCP-2929 can be thought of as an array of columns each several molecules wide and composed of a silicon dioxide (SiO,,2,,; quartz), magnesium oxide (MgO; magnesia), and ferrous-ferric oxide (Fe,,3,,O,,4,,; magnetite) glass, otherwise known as obsidian.  These columns rapidly move up and down.  Individual columns have never been recorded to extend or depress farther than approximately 150 meters.  A "tube" or "shell" of stationary obsidian about 50Å wide forms the curved surface of SCP-2929.

These movements produce patterns that vary widely and include but are not limited to: discernible "peaks" and "troughs"; ripples; slow undulations; erratic angular spikes; brief regular polygonal figures; multiple extremely high or deep and very thin round "pikes" or "holes" in close proximity to one another; rising tiered square pyramids; very rare prostrate humanoid figures; et cetera.

Access to further information, detailed in Document-2929-01, is restricted to personnel of Level 3/2929 Clearance or higher.

On ██/██/1███, due to the very regular appearance of discernible patterns, it was concluded that SCP-2929 and/or an entity associated with it must be sapient or at least sentient.  Efforts at analysis and decoding of the patterns commenced immediately and concluded later that year.  

SCP-2929-1 refers to the entity presumed to be controlling SCP-2929 from the end situated in the lower mantle.  GRI readings indicate it consists primarily of post-perovskite[[footnote]]A phase of magnesium silicate (MgSiO,,3,,) found in the D" layer of the lower mantle under very high pressures and temperatures.[[/footnote]] arranged in a complicated, largely stationary form[[footnote]]The non-anomalous counterpart of SCP-2929-1 would be an ultra-low velocity zone (ULVZ), patches of matter on or above the core-mantle boundary with extremely low seismic velocities.  The velocities are so low that many can be considered solid and even form simple structures.  ULVZs often correlate with the edges of the African and Pacific Large Low Shear Velocity Provinces (LLSVPs); SCP-2929-1 is near the edge of the African LLSVP but may or may not correlate to it, depending on its origins.[[/footnote]].

In addition to other movements, SCP-2929-1 originally broadcast a loop of eight parabolic figures in a line, with each figure extending and depressing at different intervals.  On-location researchers realized this could be interpreted as representing the numbers 0 to 128 in binary, with "peaks" representing "1s" and "troughs" representing "0s," followed by a seemingly arbitrary series of numbers.

On-location cryptographers and linguists found that by using a simple substitution code with a previously unheard of dialect bearing similarities to ancient Khoisan[[footnote]]Commonly referred to as "click-languages."[[/footnote]] languages, the second series of binary numbers could be interpreted as a greeting followed by a phrase akin to "SENDWAVES."  On ██/██/1███, following approval from O5 Command, on-site technicians directed a focused gamma ray wave transmission of a greeting in modern Sandawe by binary in the direction of SCP-2929-1.  A transcript of the ensuing dialogue follows.

> //Note: Following this interview, SCP-2929-1 has failed to offer any additional information other than that on traditional Tanzanian medicines.  SCP-2929-1 has not expressed any meaningful understanding of human anatomy or disease, only simple treatments and remedies.//
> 
> //Note from Dr. Barlow: I feel that SCP-2929-1 is hiding something from us.  It claims the Foundation is the first to have successfully responded to it, which on its own sounds reasonable; it is unlikely the Bende or Pimbwe peoples had access to gamma ray transmitters or understood binary.  However, the source of its comprehension of the language it uses, the concept of humans, et cetera is largely unknown.  Unless SCP-2929-1's claim of having known what it knows from the beginning is to be taken as truth, the only way for it to know this information is to learn it from an outside source, possibly an anomalous individual.  SCP-2929-1 is not to be trusted as a reliable source of information on anything other than traditional medicines.//
