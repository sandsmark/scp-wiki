++++ Event-Featured Articles

* December 24, Christmas Eve! For some, a day to prepare for the upcoming holiday. For some, a day to celebrate. And for others, not quite the happiest day. See how [[[december-24th-2011-hub|some Foundation employees]]] handle the holidays, courtesy of [[*user Jacob Conwell]].
* New Year's Eve! Yes, that's right, the calm before the storm, December 31 is the final day of, frankly, a shitfuck year that was 2016. For some, they were more [[[Quiet Days]]]. [[*user Dmatix]] has you covered in the more somber send-off of the year.

++++ Rest of the News

++++ Fandom Stuff

What's been going on in the community aside from our site? Well...

* [[*user Decibelles]] diligently scoured the web for all manner of fan art, but if you know of something he missed, let her, [[*user rumetzen]], or [[*user A Random Day]] know!

++++ Fanart

* This [http://deksto.tumblr.com/post/154127372373/yes-soon-will-have-to-move-from-keters-on stylized poster] of [[[SCP-353]]] looks really cool! Like the kind of warning posters you might see near her containment cell in the Foundation. Give [http://deksto.tumblr.com/ deksto] some love, eh?
* [http://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=11682556 Иagi] produces a ton of cool art; so many that I had trouble picking. In the end, I went with [http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&illust_id=60426303 this abstract piece] of [[[SCP-2808]]]. Many ways you can try and illustrate it, and I think this approach works just as well (and is probably easier, let's face it) than illustrating the anomaly's effects directly. But please check out their body of work!
* [http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&illust_id=60223292 This full color] work of [[[SCP-2845]]] shows it in all of its grand, menacing glory. THE DEER is truly awe-inspiring as depicted here. This was done by [http://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=281414 雨見鶏], an artist with such a lovely style, who's work I highly recommend.

Thanks for tuning in again, folks! If you're unsatisfied with the blurb(s) provided for the article(s) you wrote, feel free to change it. Of course, you could just avoid that problem entirely by sending [[*user A Random Day]] or [[*user rumetzen]] a blurb for your article. We may or may not use it (if we can think of something more attention-getting, though we can try to stick with one you give us) but we'd really would just like them in order to make the process easier for making these. This is a community thing, and we want authors to give their blurbs to sell these articles much easier. It reduces the workload we have to do, and helps the news come out that much earlier!

We look forward to 2017 with you all!
