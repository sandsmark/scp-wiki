**Item #:** SCP-903

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Access to either side of SCP-903 is to be restricted to authorized research personnel only. The entrances must be sealed and kept under surveillance at all times. During testing, under no circumstances are personnel to enter SCP-903 or attempt to cross it. Any persons attempting unauthorized entry will be subject to lethal force.

**Description:** SCP-903 is an old and incomplete Site-19 utility tunnel that connects the SCP Containment Wing with the Lambda Laboratory Wing. The tunnel is one meter in diameter and buried approximately five meters underground. Because of its incomplete nature, SCP-903 is an empty concrete tunnel and contains no piping, wiring, or other utility equipment. SCP-903 also contains an old rail system that consists of a single monorail that spans the entire length of SCP-903. Station A is the station on the Containment Wing side while Station B is the station on the Laboratory side.

SCP-903 was originally used as a discreet method of transporting SCPs from the Containment Wing directly to the Lambda Laboratory Wing. Due to its isolated location, SCP-903 proved to be an effective way to move SCPs in the most secure way possible. However, this practice was discontinued shortly after Incident 903-1 where the presiding personnel violated standard operating procedure and transported several SCPs at once, rather than one at a time. The resulting incident is most likely what caused SCP-903 to be in its current condition.

At first glance, SCP-903's most obvious feature is the fact that the entire tunnel is completely visible, despite the lack of any internal lighting. The lighting appears to be emanating from the white line of paint spiraling around the tunnel walls, but the exact method how this works is unclear. However, when a person or object attempts to traverse SCP-903, they are afflicted by a random effect. This appears to be based on the ability of one or any of the SCPs that have been transported through SCP-903. The effects are impossible to predict, making SCP-903 too dangerous for further use.

So far, SCP-903 has been recorded to replicate the effects of forty six different SCPs, all confirmed to have been items that had been transported through SCP-903 at some point. Experiments continue to see whether the effects of the other ███ SCPs tested will manifest.

**Complaint Log**:
12/22/████
//Incident 903-1 caused a power surge that knocked out electricity for all of Site-19. Fortunately, backup generators maintained power to the containment wing. Personnel responsible for the incident have been disciplined accordingly.//

1/20/████
//Observation and reconnaissance was unable to determine the source of the disturbance. Any further reports of ‘screaming’ are to be reported to Site Security.//

1/30/████
//In response to the sudden and unfortunate electrocution of two maintenance personnel, all internal wiring and lighting in Tunnel 3 will be removed for inspection until further notice.//

2/3/████
//The sudden appearance of [DATA EXPUNGED] in the tunnel so far has no explanation. SCP-███'s abilities are to reviewed and Site-19 is to be locked down until further notice.//

2/4/████
//Personnel examining Tunnel 3 were extracted after they unexpectedly collapsed. Autopsies showed that all personnel inside Tunnel 3 experienced a sudden and catastrophic loss of all bone marrow tissue. Three casualties total.//

2/5/████
//Tunnel 3 begins glowing without the presence of any lighting. Area immediately evacuated and locked down until further notice.//

2/10/████
//Tunnel 3 closed down and redesignated SCP-903.//

2/11/████
//Testing for SCP-903 begins. Request for D-Class personnel sent.//

**Addendum**: //SCP-903 is starting to generate abilities that do not match those of SCPs that were carried through it. It seems to be mixing and matching abilities so that it creates completely new and unseen effects. Examples include, but are not limited to: [DATA EXPUNGED]. -Dr. ████████//
