##deeppink|KeeLee:## Don't worry about it, ##hotpink|Sara##. Bit of an ongoing issue.

##deeppink|KeeLee:## Don't get me wrong, Jess is a great gal. I just need to talk with her in private for a bit.

##hotpink|Sara:## oooookay! :|

##PaleVioletRed|Angel:## ##hotpink|Sara## Ugh, you have NO IDEA how disappointed I was searching that name to find something like this https://youtu.be/oHDaKtx6bGY

//**##black|PINK FLY## whispered:** tl;dr: Jess has a habit of airing her issues to the whole chat. Try not to poke her too hard.//

##PaleVioletRed|Angel:## It's just so much bad vibes. And like, such a //boy// thing to listen to.

##hotpink|Sara:## ...

##hotpink|Sara:## whaet

##coral|Cora:## ugh, listening to it's making me feel sick

##hotpink|Sara:## oookay. no queens, then

##black|PINK FLY:## It's not //bad//, per se. I don't think it meshes well with the IRC vibe.

##hotpink|Sara:## so like

##hotpink|Sara:## what does. radiohead? radiohead's cool

##black|PINK FLY:## Taylor Swift, mostly.

##hotpink|Sara:## blegh

##deeppink|KeeLee:## Hi ##hotpink|Sara##!

##hotpink|Sara:## uhhhh what just happened

##deeppink|KeeLee:## Mmm. THAT stuff.

##deeppink|KeeLee:## Cora is... a bit sensitive, I guess is the best way to put it.

##deeppink|KeeLee:## I guess there's no easy way to say this: Cora was in a cult.

##hotpink|Sara:## oh. shit, that's horrible

##deeppink|KeeLee:## It's all a bit complicated, I know. But, we're community, and community helps those in need.

##deeppink|KeeLee:## Me and the girls have done a lot of work trying to readjust her to normal.

##hotpink|Sara:## uhhhh

##hotpink|Sara:## sure that's like

##deeppink|KeeLee:## I wasn't finished.

##deeppink|KeeLee:##  Please don't interrupt me during something as serious as this.

##hotpink|Sara:## right, sorry

##deeppink|KeeLee:## As I was saying, Cora was in a cult. Brainwashing, vile stuff, made her think she was a man.

##hotpink|Sara:## ... shit, my condolences.

##deeppink|KeeLee:## Again, do not interrupt me.

##deeppink|KeeLee:## We've tried breaking it, sure. Us girls did a good job! But, there's residue.

##deeppink|KeeLee:## I'm not sure how, but you triggered some cult meme in the back of her brain.

##deeppink|KeeLee:## So I suppose just be more careful in the future.

##deeppink|KeeLee:## You may respond.

##hotpink|Sara:## right

##hotpink|Sara:## i'm sorry she had to go through that. i uh, have a friend she could talk to. went through something similar with conversion therapy, came out the other end living her best self.

##hotpink|Sara:## idk. i'm not trans but i know the world gets very hard if you are.

##deeppink|KeeLee:## ...

##hotpink|Sara:## and it's good to have su-what's that for

##deeppink|KeeLee:## I mean no offense, ##hotpink|Sara##, but we're trying to get her //out// of the cult.

##hotpink|Sara:## whu

##hotpink|Sara:## what kinda cult are you talking about

##deeppink|KeeLee:## Listen: you have talent. You're an amazing artist (even if I //do// need you to redesign a few of your proposed layouts). But if you can't treat Cora's condition with respect, I don't know if I can have you on the team. 

##deeppink|KeeLee:## She's been //hurt//. Ingrained with poisonous cult nonsense. Had her sense of self effectively //raped//. You can't come in here expecting to fix that.

##deeppink|KeeLee:## I'm not //paying// you for that.

##deeppink|KeeLee:## Enough of that.

##deeppink|KeeLee:## Good work on the banner! While I'll need you to overhaul the the articles, front page, and contacts, you've more than earned that bounty.

##hotpink|Sara:## uh, thanks.

##hotpink|Sara:## i'll see what i can do. send me some changelists and i'll get to it

##hotpink|Sara:## in a day, tho. i got a date with a cute dude at 7

##deeppink|KeeLee:## Hope it goes well! <3

##hotpink|Sara:## this just feels weird, like i'm the protagonist of some shitty ~gender equality~ cartoon written by a man

##hotpink|Sara:## surrounded by vapid bullshit

##black|PINK FLY:## It's probably for the best. Lesbian drama is a hassle.

##hotpink|Sara:## :/

##hotpink|Sara:## sone of my best friends are lesbians

##black|PINK FLY:## My bad, sorry. I'm just speaking from personal experience working with a gaggle of them. At the very least, you seem cool-headed.

##hotpink|Sara:## about time

##deeppink|KeeLee:## You are an incredibly poor judge of character.

##deeppink|KeeLee:## On the basis of... who?

##deeppink|KeeLee:## Someone who would traffic a dangerous memetic hazard?

##hotpink|Sara:## what are you doing

##deeppink|KeeLee:## This "friend" of yours has poisoned the well. He's obviously jealous; you have good pay, a supportive environment, and don't get me //started// on how this looks on a resume.

##deeppink|KeeLee:## He's sensed that you've been a bit ungrateful. That you've put a wedge between us.

##hotpink|Sara:## shut up

##deeppink|KeeLee:## It's true.

##deeppink|KeeLee:## He's exploited said wedge, trying to drive you out. Did he even test his meme? Did you see it in action before you used it?

##hotpink|Sara:## shut the fuck up. she's been this

##deeppink|KeeLee:## Has she? And yet this meme had the exact //opposite// effect. How do you know she's not lying, ##hotpink|Sara##? I know it can be hard to accept, but this is a clear-cut case of a crab in a bucket.

##black|PINK FLY:## Oh, interesting.

##black|PINK FLY:## You actually look a bit familiar.

##hotpink|Sara:## oh yeah! we've played a few shows around soho, mostly eird shit, been to any of those

##black|PINK FLY:## Not quite. Sorry, I feel like I know you from somewhere, but I can't put my finger on it.

##hotpink|Sara:## :?

##hotpink|Sara:## word's gotten around fast?

##black|PINK FLY:## Wait, now I remember.

##black|PINK FLY:## iicameras.prm/models/babylonshedim

##black|PINK FLY:## Is this you?

##hotpink|Sara:## ...

##black|PINK FLY:## I'll admit it's an interesting revenue model. Do Rivka and Yehezkel know about this?

##hotpink|Sara:## ...

##black|PINK FLY:## Hmm.

##black|PINK FLY:## Should I tell them?

##hotpink|Sara:## how did you know that

##black|PINK FLY:## Answer the question, before I make that choice.

##hotpink|Sara:## no

##hotpink|Sara:## please don't

##black|PINK FLY:## Oh, really?

##black|PINK FLY:## Hrm, maybe I //want// to. What to do, what to do...

##hotpink|Sara:## what do you want

##hotpink|Sara:## tell me what you want

##black|PINK FLY:## Right now? What I //really// want is to spread the word.

##black|PINK FLY:## I've been meaning to break down the annoying little jewess for a while. Breaking my memetics was the red line, really, but I bit my tongue until you started pushing it.

##black|PINK FLY:## ##deeppink|KeeLee##'s wrong, you //have// been useful. I'm not much of a web developer, but this work on the site proper bumped my pay grade too much to ignore.

##black|PINK FLY:## It'd be a //shame// to lose you now.

##hotpink|Sara:## ...

##black|PINK FLY:## Can I count on you?

##hotpink|Sara:## ...

##hotpink|Sara:## yes ma'am.

##black|PINK FLY:## Good.

##black|PINK FLY:## And, oh: as thanks for my generosity, I'll be taking half your wages.

##black|PINK FLY:## But it's better than the nothing you'd get otherwise, isn't it?

##hotpink|Sara:## no, actually.

##hotpink|Sara:## the past month sucked.

##hotpink|Sara:## i got dumped by my date, i barely have enough to cover my meds, and you forced me to make a cult site.

##hotpink|Sara:## the maw of it, actually

##hotpink|Sara:## fucking hilarious, innit. a cult so shitty you have to brainwash your members.

##violet|Jess:## Oh dear. I'm sorry, ##hotpink|Sara##.

##hotpink|Sara:## fuck off. i wasted enough of my life on this shitty slice of the web.

##hotpink|Sara:## i don't need any more of your fake "sympathy". everything you touch turns to pink, glittery shit. brainwashed, homophobic shit

##hotpink|Sara:## you took everything from me. my pay, my dignity, my integrity, what little happiness i had left, and crushed it into a plastic, eye-searing paste. all i have left is sara, and i'll die before you get to take that too

##hotpink|Sara:## goodbye. i hope all of you break this cult shit and live long, happy lives

##hotpink|Sara:## but i'm not holding my breath.

##violet|Jess:## "JGT isn't for everyone. Obviously it's not for you. I get that. But there's good people there, people who've helped me carry on in the face of incredibly dark times. No matter your experience with Kee or Terry, there will always be someone that has your back."

##violet|Jess:## "I was hoping I could know you better. As a friend. You're lively and opinionated and strong and smart and everything I wish I could be. even the nights you came in drunk were some of the best times I've had on the JGT chat."
