title:SCP-5291
**Item #:** SCP-5291

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** --SCP-5291 is to be kept in Dr. Geri's office-- SCP-5291 is to be stored in a standard containment locker. Subjects who have successfully used SCP-5291 are to have their existing cells customized dependent on the extent of their transformation.

--Testing of SCP-5291 is to continue for as long as researchers believe they can discover why SCP-5291 is dysfunctional.--

**Description:** SCP-5291 is a mechanical typewriter that is incapable of transferring ink to paper, with no discernable reason as to why. Despite each key fully extending its respective striker when pressed, and despite the ribbon leaving traces of ink when contacted without the use of the keys, the typewriter does not leave any distinguishable mark when used normally.

SCP-5291 was discovered by Dr. Samuel Geri within an antique shop. After 35 hours of personally examining it, Dr. Geri brought it to the Foundation and insisted that it be tested. As of writing, Dr. Geri has also volunteered to be responsible for testing and containment of the anomaly.

**Addendum 5291-1:** SCP-5291 has proven functional on certain occasions, though the precise conditions required are so far unclear.

Use of SCP-5291 also results in transformation of the user; however, the connection between the text and the effect are not always clear (see Testing Log 5291-1). Testing will now continue until researchers can determine the cause of the inconsistency of SCP-5291.

> Dear Geri,

> You win, it's anomalous. We've tried everything to fix it: Replacing the ribbon over and over, using the cleanest paper imaginable, making sure every screw was in place, warping reality throughout the chamber, even negotiating with the damn thing. Still, we don't see why it needs to be contained, at least in an official cell. I'll speak to the guys responsible for the documentation, but you may as well keep it in your office for now. Maybe someone will trip and knock it on the floor, and //that// will somehow fix it.

> What's happened is that during unrelated testing, I've met a specific D-class several times. Started out quite the curious fellow. However, he kept getting quieter and quieter as the days went on. I found myself curious, since testing in my case is of course not life threatening or particularly stressful. So, I invited him to my office to talk about it (and I know you tell me it's useless to connect with D-class personnel but wait till you hear what happened!)
> 
> I asked him what the problem was. He remained quiet, and just glanced around the room at my things. After a bit more prodding, I offhandedly asked if he'd like to write it down for me. At that, he wordlessly picked up the typewriter, sat down, and began pecking away. I couldn't help but wait to see him react to nothing appearing on the paper, thinking it might encourage him to open up more directly. But then he kept on typing and handed me the sheet. And as you've probably guessed, there were words on it. Imagine that! Also, there was a bit of an odd side effect; you'll see what I mean.

When I first woke up here, that tiny ass cell was all I knew of this place. Then one of you lot opened and dragged me to one of these tests. And every time we left after that, we'd go down a different corridor. I tried to draw a map in my cell, but it just kept going and going. I expected a boundary, or at least a window somewhere. Every time I think I've found the edge, I see a turn that goes straight past it. And that says nothing of each room I've been in, the things I've had to witness, to survive.

Then one day I go back to my cell and find the map completely erased. There wasn't a camera in my cell. Or was there? Were there other ways you creeps could listen? They wouldn't be listening in on you, though, right? They wouldn't see a note like this, would they?

And just imagine what will happen when we finally know what makes it tick. We might even have a new Thaumiel SCP on our hands; imagine agents and researchers being able to shape shift themselves as they type. Sounds incredibly useful in our field, huh?

> Now, as for testing so far, I've been staying on schedule. Problem is it feels like we're back at square one while passing Go. Yeah, I've had //one// new result, but we've still come full circle. Aside from the one guy who now has poorer eyesight (well, it's a little different than that, but still), I would say we've done several variations of having a putz push keys on a typewriter. The conditions that had the most promise (that being, letting a D-class wander my office until he eventually decides to play with the typewriter) gave didly squat. In fact, the most recent success was in an average, dull testing chamber where we asked one of them to type "whatever came to his mind." The sheer opposite of before.

Subject's pupils have compressed to the point of entirely preventing light from contacting the retina. Despite this, subject claims to be viewing the city of Chicago from the ground level. Subject states they are unable to alter the location and angle of their viewing[[footnote]]That being the Jackson Boulevard Bridge and a Northern angle, respectively.[[/footnote]]. Comparing the subject's observations with activity in the area confirms they are viewing in real time.

There was a river I could stare into forever. Fields of pure grass lined both of its borders. The boats full of fishermen and fisherwomen would interrupt my viewing sessions, their passengers looking ahead and not down; not to mention the bridge I stood on would break on occasion, forcing me to stand to the side so it could eventually repair itself. Otherwise, the river was mine. Made for me. Made for everyone I suppose, but only appreciated by me.

So far it may work if someone is describing an experience they've had. Simple as that. Sure, results might still be scarce, but we could at least eliminate one possibility if nothing comes of it in another couple years.

Once upon a time a crab at the bottom of the ocean found himself lost. Suddenly he saw a shark coming along. He buried himself in the sand and hid in his shell. The shark ate him anyway. The crab stayed in his shell, and the shark continued to swim. He went through the shark's whole system until he popped right out and landed on the sand again. He found himself lost again. The end.

That drink we shared was fun; remember that discussion we had regarding the source of the anomalous? We argued for an hour, but I remember you smiling the whole time.

You've got talent, I can see it; you might realize I'm the //only// one who sees it. Other researchers see you as a time waster at this point, on top of the rest of the quirks you walked into the Foundation with. I want you to rise through the ranks, reach a better position other than working with low-key anomalies. Originally that was because I had the same expectations for you as I have for other new recruits. But on top of that, now I want us to continue working together. We both have something the other lacks; don't you want that?

I've studied science, I've observed science, I've even practiced a bit of science; but I don't have the mindset of a scientist. I'm surprised the puppet masters here even spotted me on their radar.
> 
> I haven't been testing for a conclusion. Partly, I just find enjoyment listening to the D-class personnel. From what they've seen, what they've felt, they act as though nothing can be trusted anymore. Even after they transformed, they were surprisingly underwhelmed. It's almost natural to them. It's natural to me, too, but for a different reason. We shouldn't have a mere few thousand of anomalies here; we should have //millions.// The anomalous can be found everywhere; under the sidewalk, up the chimney, on the pillars of a train station. Someone simply needs to take interest.
> 
> That's what I was hoping for when I came here. But the most interesting thing I've found was a typewriter that doesn't type. Other than that, it's paperwork. People handing off their stinking paperwork. I've barely discovered the anomalous, only read about what everyone else has done.
> 
> So maybe (and by now it's a big maybe), if I keep working with the typewriter, something will come up. An anomaly that the Foundation hasn't seen. A transformation that will knock the rest of them off their feet. I slowly realized that to do that, I'd need to figure out how it works. I'd type something up myself if it would give me that missing piece.
