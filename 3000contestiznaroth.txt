**Item #:** SCP-3000

**Object Class:** --Euclid-- Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** The word ‘Causal-Absent Paranoia’ is to retain a dictionary definition as follows: ‘the healthy brain overreacting to natural stimulus due to overindulgence, excessive stress, lack of sleep, and other such strains to the mind and body.’ All cultural and social references to the word must be kept in this manner.

An instance of SCP-3000-1 is to be contained utilizing a series of falsifications to trap its ‘presence’ inside a dummy household. One D-Class personnel with extreme antisocial tendencies and a verifiable response to SCP-3000 is to be staged there at all times to prevent containment breach. The D-Class is not to be informed of their role, classification, location, or communicate with any outsiders. The D-Class must, in all cases, believe himself to be trapped in an abandoned, unfamiliar house with the entity, completely alone.

The household has 32 windows and 46 mirrors. The following rooms are to be lit: the Bedroom, West Hall, Grand Hall, Rec Room, and storage. No other rooms have light fixtures. Food is to be periodically restocked when the resident D-Class is a suitable distance from Storage. There must be a Scranton Reality Anchor posed at each corner of the building, and two in the vault in the household's basement.

Through the windows, a falsified night-time countryside is to be constructed, and kept in a perpetual state of darkness. The door must be bolted shut and reinforced with steel, all windows must be fitted with 7.5 centimeter thick windows of bulletproof glass, and all walls lined with a 5 centimeter thick steel composite.

These procedures are privy to immediate alteration upon discovery of more effective mass-containment for SCP-3000-1 instances.
    
**Description:** SCP-3000 is the anomalous byproduct of a nearly undetectable entity, hereby classified as SCP-3000-1. SCP-3000 is characterized as a sensation of "being watched", similar to that of being intensely stared at or observed unwillingly by another human or sentient being.

SCP-3000-1 and its effects are inconsistent in their manifestation unless certain specific requirements are met. In particular, small spaces, single-room areas, sterile environments (closed off hospital rooms, Prisons, etc.), and Foundation containment cells prove ineffective at causing it to manifest. The only known way to bring about an instance of SCP-3000-1 with complete consistency is to stage a single human in a house, or something resembling a living space of at least 500 square meters with minimal lighting. Any other cases of SCP-3000-1 appearance seem to be random.

The entity has few known physical traits, and a certain set of tendencies in its pursuit of others. It only pursues solitary humans, generally between the age of 16-40. It cannot pursue pilots of automobiles or other fast-moving vehicles. Its most common victims tend to be alone in their own property, and the time-frame follows the trend of 12:00 a.m. to sunrise, which limits the sample space to individuals with a tendency to remain awake at those times.

Often times those who experience SCP-3000 tend to report it from behind. If their back is to the wall, they tend to avoid the nearest window or dark corner. Mirrors cause extreme aversion in sufferers of SCP-3000, and they often flee to sections of their house that lack both of the aforementioned objects.

    SCP-3000 sufferers can not sleep under any circumstances. This is not due to fear, but a fundamental part of SCP-3000-1 that manipulates the parts of the brain that control melatonin production, dream regulation, and sleep induction, making them completely inoperable. It is assumed to be caused by a very faint insertion of a gaseous substance into the local atmosphere. This is classified as CAP-induced-insomnia and also given a medical explanation.

    SCP-3000-1 is perceived as passively hostile to humankind. It has a specific set of triggers that, when activated, will cause it to [DATA EXPUNGED] the subject. Detail in Addendum SCP-3000-A.

    The triggers tend to be the following: Actively hunting the source of SCP-3000 with intent to destroy or harm, prolonged contact with mirrors, windows, or unlit rooms, long periods of sustained silence, direct contact with the ‘presence’ of the entity, panic, blood, and any attempt to contact other human beings.

If two of these triggers are met greater than 3 times (with the exception of attempted contact or awareness of the entity, which instantly activates it), the entity will "activate", performing one of the previously mentioned acts. The rate of survival is precisely █ %. 

Avoidance of human interaction (e.g. antisocial disorders) can either have an extreme attraction effect or an extreme repellent effect on the entity. Individuals who excel in human interaction (particularly sociopaths) produce a strange, relatively unknown effect that can cause several severe anomalies. Testing is not advised. One such incident is detailed in "Recordings from D-17729".

Currently, Site 2C is utilized primarily for information gathering. As there are likely hundreds of thousands of instances of SCP-3000-1, it is considered less of a containment operation and more of a wildlife observation venture. If any information on the nature of SCP-3000-1's presence, congregation, locations, quantity, or otherwise related traits are discovered, they should be reported to Site-2C's Overseers immediately, upon which any needed containment procedures will be amended. Mass containment of SCP-3000-1 instances are a high priority.

> **SCP-3000-1: Known Physiological Traits and Habits**
> 
> As of the current time, little is known of the physical appearance, locations, dependence on humans, or origin of SCP-3000-1 instances. However, due to the continued containment of a particular instance, the following information has been discovered.
> 
> 1. SCP-3000-1 is not perceivable in any wavelength of light. Even in instances of D-Class personnel seeking the entity in a manner implying that they can visualize it or pinpoint its location, the only tell of its location is given after a reactive incident.
> 
> 2. SCP-3000-1 has a particular reaction towards those expressive of antisocial disorders. Simply put, about 50% of antisocial people do not react to anything in scenarios where SCP-3000-1 would manifest. Those that it can interact with, however, express a complete incapability of producing a reactive incident, even if they enact any of the triggers for such incidents. These cases seem to feel the effects of SCP-3000 at a higher intensity than normal.
> 
> 3. SCP-3000-1's biological appearance and structure are unknown. However, it is apparent that SCP-3000-1 is still constrained by physical variables, and thus has a degree of physical presence. If a victim is contained within a small space (minimum of 3.5x3.5x3.5 square meters) or is within an area that has all entrances secure and no mirrors or windows present, SCP-3000-1 will not manifest. (For this reason, no doors in Site-2C can lock and will always open on their own after 30 minutes.) This implies that SCP-3000-1 cannot pass through physical matter other than windows and mirrors, and does in fact have a specific height (apparently above 3.5 meters.)
> 
> 4. Upon enough of the aforementioned triggers being activated, a reactive event begins. These events are preceded with an extreme spike in the levels of adrenaline in the victim, and they respond with an immediate panicked reaction. At this stage, SCP-3000-1 will manifest in the following ways: Through mirrors, windows, or [DATA EXPUNGED]. The entity will apparently proceed to [DATA EXPUNGED], extruding the victim's [DATA EXPUNGED]. Subsequently, the newly carved bone matter will retract into the breach (where the entity emerged), and the remains of the victim will [DATA EXPUNGED].
> 
> 5. When a reactive event is triggered, a cognitohazard manifests in the form of a 'total memory erasure', where any associated memories of the person(s) involved in the event are destroyed. This can be easily circumvented, however, by keeping written documents of the victims on hand at all times, or by a suitable amount of Scranton Reality Anchors active within the area. The reason written information is retained through this is unknown. Note one exception - those influenced by the spatial anomaly (See #7) can be erased from written documentation as well. However, this is inconsistent, and does not always occur (traces of their names and background remain interspersed throughout documentation.)
> 
> 6. After such an event, the instance of SCP-3000-1 supposedly enters a state of stasis. This can only be proven by the fact that all mirrors and windows within a ███ meter radius appear opaque to all forms of light, and normal SCP-3000 symptoms are reported by all humans in this region. 
> 
> 7. After a reactive event, a rapid deconstruction of the environment surrounding the incident begins. This spatial anomaly occurs around █ seconds after the event. The anomaly causes the area surrounding to rapidly expand and populate into a series of tight, dark corridors and small rooms filled with mirrors and reflective surfaces. The room of origin is likely inaccessible. A single exploration has been attempted and recorded following a particular reactive incident. (See addendum "Exploration Log From Testing Site 2A" for details). This effect is entirely mitigated by SRAs.
> 
> 8. Only █ occurrences of a reactionary event have been detected. The spatial anomaly that follows dissipates after ██ hours, but SCP-3000 symptoms persist indefinitely within ██ meters of the event location. Whether this implies that the instance of SCP-3000-1's stasis is indefinite is uncertain.

> **D-17729:** Shit, that's dark. What is this, a horror movie? HEY! IS ANYBODY THERE?
> 
> //Subject continues through the upper floor, reaches the staircase into Foyer (F). Light is set to on. Symptoms of SCP-3000 surface lightly, with occasional looks behind him.//
> 
> **D-17729:** What the hell. Nobody behind you, Mike. You're fine... Door's locked? 
> 
> //Subject begins attempt to bash door down. Failure.//
> 
> **D-17729:** Fucking steel? What kind of house is this?  Is it nighttime? God damn, this has gotta be a nightmare.
> 
> //Proceeding three hours are of Subject navigating the containment 'cell', occasionally musing to himself. Symptoms of SCP-3000 rapidly surface, and Subject begins to develop an extremely severe aversion to the unlit areas of containment.//
> 
> //One day after containment. Wedged in Foyer corner.//
> 
> **D-17729:** Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Please, God, let me wake up...
> 
> //Two days after containment. Subject in Bedroom. All light fixtures are on. Faced away from mirrors, in southeastern corner.//
> 
> **D-17729:** ...need food. I need food. Storage room's downstairs. Through dark. Nobody's here, Mike. You're not afraid of the dark.

> **D-17729:** ...fuck. You've gotta be kidding.
> 
> //Four days after containment. Subject is still in storage room. All shelves have been disassembled, fashioned into a makeshift barrier obstructing the Basement Hall from sight.//
> 
> **D-17729:** Need to kill it. Not even in here. Not safe here. The light only works a little, then you're done for. Need sleep, God I need sleep.
> 
> //Seven days after containment. Subject is in storage room corner. Wiring from walls has been torn out using a makeshift crowbar, and extra light fixtures have been used to keep the entire room at a state of brightness. D-17729 was previously an electrical engineer, and such activity was expected, so no action will be taken.//
> 
> **D-17729:** ...This isn't a dream, is it.
> 
> //Nine days after containment. Subject has fashioned a makeshift suit covered in light fixtures with a portable crank-generator. Noted that generator must be removed upon Subject's termination.//
> 
> **D-17729:** Take it back to them. Kill them all. Not alone. Not alone. Take the light to their door. Not alone. More light. More light. More light. 
> 
> //This continues for about four hours before subject falls asleep. Reason for this is as of now unknown, as sleep in SCP-3000-1's presence is extremely rare, if not impossible in all cases. Upon awakening, Storage has been restocked, and lights have been put out. Subject's light-jacket is left alone, to prevent disturbance from sleep. Subject reawakens.//
> 
> **D-17729:** Ha! It stole my light, but I have me! Cannot stop me now, fool. Need weapon. Combat them. Destroy them.
> 
> **D-17729:** Tomorrow, we fight. Tomorrow, I win. Tomorrow, I win.
> 
> //Ten days after containment. Barrier has been disassembled. Subject begins to rapidly move throughout containment, searching for instances of SCP-3000-A. Appears to discover something within Grand Hall.//
> 
> **D-17729:** FOUND YOU! FOUND YOU FOUND YOU DON'T TRY AND HIDE. I HAVE LIGHT, LIGHT, LIGHT AND I HAVE FOUND YOU! COME OUT!
> 
> //Subject rushes towards an unknown position in Grand hall, near piano. Upon Subject's approach, the start of a reactive event begins, but appears to fail. Subject screams before activity ceases. Connection with recording device is lost. Site undergoes spatial anomaly and is promptly evacuated.//

Exploration Unit MTF-066 "Eight Blind Men" sent in to attempt to locate Grand Hall and recover any indications of a reactive event/remnants of D-17729. Speakers are resident overseer Dr. Obrendt, MTF-066 Captain (Cap), and members of MTF-066 (1-7).//
> 
> **Cap:** Alright, doc. We're waiting outside the site. Orders?
> 
> **Obrendt:** Enter the site. Report any signs of cognitohazards or interruptions of mental faculties immediately. That goes for all of you guys. We don't know what might happen in there.

> 
> **Cap:** Uhh... Thirty seconds. Time dilation. Noted.
> 
> **Obrendt:** Could be linked to hallways, since communication isn't being stretched. Be wary of long passages.
> 
> **MTF-066-7:** That's gonna be tough. Nothing but hallways here.
