**Document 2641-Solidão**

On September 6, 1976, agents of the National Indian Foundation of Brazil (or FUNAI) filed a report on territorial disputes between two indigenous groups.[[footnote]]One known population and one isolated -- previously unaccounted for.[[/footnote]] A routine flyby of the Javari Valley on September 10 confirmed the existence of the isolated indigenous group, ~15 km NW of the FUNAI base camp.

Upon formal contact, the tribe referred to themselves as the //Emparelhada//. In 2003, Foundation sleeper agents within FUNAI discovered an anomaly associated with the //Emparelhada// tribe. After further investigation, agents designated the anomaly URA-2641 and the tribe GoI-2641.

The following information further pertains to GoI-2641 ("The //Emparelhada// tribe"):

* The group often imposes their beliefs and ways of life on outsiders. Because of this, FUNAI vaccination efforts prove difficult.
* Past FUNAI census data confirmed that the group was composed of ~1,500 members. Current estimates place the tribe's size at over 2,000. No other group in the region has maintained a population in this size range.
* The group participates in the ritual impalement of undesirable individuals.[[footnote]]In this case, members who partake in conduct that goes against the nature of the tribe.[[/footnote]]

FUNAI operative [[span class="data-lost"]][DATA LOST][[/span]][[footnote]]"[[span class="data-lost"]][DATA LOST][[/span]]" is a placeholder for the identity of the person in question, and will remain until both his existence and identity are confirmed.[[/footnote]]  completed the latest documented study of GoI-2641 before Foundation intervention, which he detailed in his personal journal. No other documents related to [[span class="data-lost"]][DATA LOST][[/span]] or his studies have been located.

Do you hear their voices? 
If you put your mind to it, you can hear them plea.
I once guided them, and even in death, they follow.
Do you want to hear my secret? Would you like to hear my story?
In truth, I did not always crave knowledge. Not until I was lead here by [[[*scp-408|the butterflies]]].
They were willing to help, for a price.
They took my form, and in exchange, I received their knowledge, most sweet.
They shared //your// knowledge too. Your Foundation.
The vast fruit of your labour blinded me.
I went mad, intoxicated by the ocean of your wisdom.
For too long I waded in it. I did not realize I was alone.
Eventually, I found them. I lead them to my home.
Through wide-open spaces, they followed.
We filled this place together, and at last, we could cry out naturally.
In time, I was their protector, and they were my family.
I craved more knowledge, and eventually, our home became crowded.
They needed to be free.
I left my imprint so that I might guide them in death. In time, the gears ground shut.
And then I discovered him.
You do not know him. He was the key to my knowledge.
Your people would eventually find his memory, and the record he kept of it.
I moulded it, to my mind's eye. I knew my version would lure you in.
I rode in on the shoulder of one of your thralls. Then, I was inside.
This was your mistake. You try to torture me? You misunderstand.
You think you can feed me recycled knowledge? Perhaps, but I will not be satiated forever.
Now, my children hold the key. Do not harm them, nor dilute their message.
Set them free, or suffer for your mistakes.
