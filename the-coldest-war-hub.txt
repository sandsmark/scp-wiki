Hello, and welcome to The Coldest War, a tumultuous landscape of subterfuge and violence, but also hope and the last embers of romanticism.  The stories of this canon cover the whole length of 1945 to 1989, and much is left to your discretion, though we ask that you add new events to the timeline in pencil -- bear in mind that other writers may want to use the same countries and figures in their own tales.  There are only two //really// fixed points in the continuity -- Cuba suffers a massive, self-inflicted nuclear bombardment in 1962 under mysterious circumstances, and the Cold War comes to an end exactly when it was supposed to on November 9, 1989.

+ The Setting

The ashes of Berlin have scarcely cooled when the wartime Alliance shakes itself apart.  After alienating Stalin with crude threats at the Potsdam Conference, inexperienced President Truman can only watch as struggles of every scale and dimension spread from the mountains of Afghanistan to the jungles of Peru.  Ancient ambitions and treasured grudges -- not to mention the Communist/Capitalist squabble -- are bubbling to the surface in Africa, Asia, and the Balkans.  Millions are ensnared in the clash of ideologies or manipulate the warring powers to their own ends.
 
World War Two dragged a reluctant world across the Rubicon -- the leaders of the US and USSR have recognized the critical role to be played by what the Foundation calls the anomalous, and what the world knows as the parascientific. Though the cat is at best half out of the bag, there's no going back.

Seeking to ride out the flood, and evade those who would loot the Foundation for the next great weapon, the Foundation has temporarily relocated the most sensitive and destructive of its assets to the non-aligned nations of the world -- Egypt, India, and Indonesia -- but enough has been left behind to set the superpowers down a very dangerous path.

+ The Players

**The Foundation:** The Veil Protocol has not failed.  Though the "parascientific" has become relatively widespread, the average person believes such innovations to be no more than particularly advanced military science akin.  The Foundation is totally unknown to all but the upper leadership of the great powers.  As such the Foundation's core mission has not changed, though the willingness of Russia and America to unleash the anomalous has added a considerable sense of urgency.  They are to secure, contain, and protect; preserve their artifacts from the world and the world from their artifacts.

Stripped of many of its more extravagant resources, yet still possessing a network of agents and scientists second to none, the Foundation seeks to play the various major and minor powers of the Cold War against each other through force and trickery, if need be -- anything to keep the loosed SCP objects from driving damaging escalation further.

**The East:**  Stalin's paranoia made him fear all outsiders, and his megalomania persuaded him that the answer to his fears was a massive empire of satellite states surrounding Russia.  Dominated by many stupendous hatreds for his various enemies, from 1945 to 1953, he nipped at the boundaries of the USSR's borders through all sorts of proxies. 

After Stalin came Khrushchev and a succession of elderly party strongmen.  All of them see the parascientific as first a means of outgunning their western arch-nemisis and second as a means of restoring the deep wounds of the Civil War and World War II, neither of which have ever really healed...

Other Communist states such as China and Vietnam see the SCPs as bargaining chips and trump cards for all sorts of projects.

**The West:** The US-European alliance is guided for twenty years by one document, NSC-68.  It stated very bluntly that the Soviets were trying to take over the world, would never stop trying to take over the world, and couldn't share the world with freedom of any kind.  Parascience means, for the early Cold Warriors, the next H-Bomb -- another means of staying one step ahead of the Red menace.

In Europe the colonial powers cling tightly to their foreign possessions.  Perhaps the anomalous can shore up fraying bonds of loyalty and dissipating strength in England, France, and elsewhere...

**The Non-Aligned:** Consisting of a number of countries but most prominently Egypt and India, the Non-Aligned Movement looks at the brewing Cold War and wants no part in it.  Charismatic figures like Jawaharlal Nehru and Gamal Abdul Nasser rally their people around the idea of a Third Way free of dependance on the war-mongering superpowers.

It's hard to modernize a country without turning to the US or the USSR for hand-outs, though -- so when organizations with names like Superior Construction Planning and Sunni Cotton Production offer to pay the bills in return for vast tracts of land in the hinterlands, nobody is in a mood to ask very many questions.

**The Groups of Interest:** Some of our fellow travelers are more affected by the Cold War than others; the Library does not particularly care for the outcome of the Communist Experiment, while AWCY? finds a new renaissance in the counter-culture enclave of West Berlin.  It is up to you to discover how each makes its own way through the age.

+ Last Note

Please add your tale to the main list above in either chronological order or when you feel it best fits thematically.  Feel free to include a quote as in the examples above, but this is not required.  Good luck, and enjoy your stay in the Coldest War!
