**Item #:** SCP-TRETTER-J

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-TRETTER-J must be kept out of any room where staff are currently creating or updating SCP documents on a computer. SCP-TRETTER-J is capable of opening doors, so doors must be locked if any work is to be done. In the event SCP-TRETTER-J is able to enter a room where computer work is being done, it should be distracted with treats or cuddles until it can be removed from the area. 

SCP-TRETTER-J is allowed to wander Site-726. A litterbox and food/water dishes have been placed in the site's cafeteria for it. During down time or off hours, personnel are encouraged to play with SCP-TRETTER-J for relaxation and morale purposes. 

**Description:** SCP-TRETTER-J is a female stray cat that Dr. Lloyd brought to Site-726 on the 18th of August, 2012. It has black fur, with the exception of a few white tufts of hair on its chest, and is currently quite overweight. Staff are reminded not to feed SCP-TRETTER-J scraps from the cafeteria. SCP-TRETTER-J is very friendly and playful. Staff have described it as "always acting like a kitten." Staff generally refer to it as 'Tretter' or 'Trots' for short. 

SCP-TRETTER-J is generally non-anomalous; however when an SCP Foundation staff member begins to create a new SCP document or edit a pre-existing one, it will anomalously become aware of this and attempt to enter the area where the document is being prepared. If SCP-TRETTER-J is able to do this, it will try to disrupt the work being done in any way it can. SCP-TRETTER-J has been observed knocking items off the desk, blocking the computer screen, stepping on the keyboard, and generally acting like a nuisance. 

**Addendum:** Below is a list of documents that SCP-TRETTER-J has affected:
* [[[SCP-1504]]] - "Joe Schmo," a particularly durable man who's every action is misperceived as normal. 
 * SCP-TRETTER-J caused Reasearcher Vanderbilt to accidently delete the pre-existing documentation, by pushing his hand controlling the mouse in an attempt to get scratches.
* [[[who-am-i | Who am I?]]] - Ongoing reasearch into the true nature of SCP-431.
 * SCP-TRETTER-J knocked an open bottle over, spilling water onto Dr. Lloyd's desk and keyboard. The keyboard stopped functioning, so work on the above document was stalled for several minutes. 
* [[[SCP-2504]]] - "Emergency Services," a set of possibly extradimensional entities aiding the Chicago emergency services in day-to-day activities.
 * SCP-TRETTER-J was able to get into Site-726's server room, while Dr. Lloyd was working on creating the anomaly's documentation, and chew through the power cords of several server racks. It is currently unknown how SCP-TRETTER-J was able to gnaw through the cords without being shocked. Due to sudden server outage, SCP-2504's documentation along with several other key documents were corrupted. Recovery of the data is still in progress. Dr. Lloyd was severely reprimanded for incorrect data protection practices.
