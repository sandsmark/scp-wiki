title:Life's Cold
The elevator. I see it every day. Or just about, since sometimes work keeps me on base for days on end. Smooth polished steel. You can see your reflection in it, with the bright white light of the single light above me. In front of me, the door, and the two buttons. Up. Down. This one only leads to two spots, while other floors are accessed from more secure elevators further inside. To my left, a side of the elevator. To my right, Doctor MacCarrick. A new guy, still Level 1. However, he’s just gotten the task of leading research on some new object. A nasty little bugger, from the file I read. I have fifty bucks saying he doesn’t last the week.

Making sure he isn’t looking, I give my cheeks a quick slap. It’s Monday, and my cold blood drains some of my color. On top of how much time I spend in my office, or just plain inside, I have a tendency to be a tad pale. 

“...... What is it MacCarrick?”

“Nothing Dr. Iceberg.”

“Really, like I said. It’s just Ice.”

He doesn’t get a chance to respond before the elevator door opens. Seemed like a longer trip down than usual. Since it’s rarely damaged, they can afford to buy a nice entrance elevator. I walk out, into a short hall. We already passed clearance up top side. However, I know full well that the security cameras were hidden, watching, and checking us, facial structure scans, or anything that seemed off. One thing wrong, and a security team would be in the room in seconds to deal with things. I’ve seen it happen. Not to me mind you, some other guy, but still. Anyways, I walk forward, toward what’s right in front of me. A desk, a rather nice one, with papers, pens, that sort of thing. And, of course, sitting behind it typing away at her computer, Break. I never got her codename, I just don’t see it. Breaking intruders upon the rocks?

Putting my suitcase down, I put on a charming smile, if I do say so myself, and lean on her desk. She’s Filipino, got some nice brown hair, a pretty face…..

    “Well, hello there Break.” 
    She sighs before responding, not even looking away from her computer. “Hello Dr. Iceberg.”
    “And how are you today lovely?”
    “Good. Must you do this?”
    “Do what Breaky?”
    “Don’t call me that.”
    “Oh, come on. So, I was wondering if you might be doing anything this week. Like, say, Friday?“
    “No.”

“Oh really now K-“ About this time, she had pulled her favorite pistol from its hiding spot and aimed it at my face. A relatively nice gun, though I prefer my custom jobs. I knew she knew how to use it. Read her profile, she’s got quite an impressive skill list for a “secretary.” She finally looks away from the screen, though it’s to look down the barrel and keep the gun centered on my face.

“Don’t call me that either. Go to work Dr. Iceberg.”

“Oh fine, fine. Maybe next time.” Putting on a slightly nervous smile, I pick my suitcase back up and walk towards the hallway to my office. 

“Not likely.” I know this all too well. Honestly, I sometimes wonder if I may be as bad as Clef with women or something. Then I just tell myself that even I’m not that bad. Heh. I wonder if maybe the issue lies with Break. I mean, I thought that she was adjusting to me, until the restraining order incident……
