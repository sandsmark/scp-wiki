--SCP-4459 and SCP-4459-A are to be contained separately in two standard containment lockers at Site-81.-- SCP-4459 and SCP-4459-A are to be contained together in a standard-sized wardrobe made from oak or maple. The wardrobe should also be filled with the other non-anomalous clothing items acquired along with SCP-4459. Every 2-3 weeks, the wardrobe is to be opened and aerated for at least 30 minutes, and the items inside should be dusted and checked for damage.

Research involving SCP-4459 and SCP-4459-A should be conducted under the supervision of head researcher Dr. Imogene Stewart, and only with permission from site administration. MTF Pi-6 "Clown Wranglers" should also be on hand in the event of a containment breach.

[[/div]]
[[include component:image-block name=theHat|caption=SCP-4459 in containment|width=250px]]

SCP-4459 is a Gentleman's Black Silk top hat that shows moderate signs of wear, including notable damage to the crown and brim. SCP-4459 was acquired along with a matching red silk hat box[[footnote]]Designated SCP-4459-A[[/footnote]] from an estate sale in Madison, WI on June 14, 2017 after local authorities had been called in reference to a domestic dispute involving the item. 

The Foundation became involved when the responding law enforcement officer reported that one of the belligerents was dressed like a clown and exhibited paranormal behavior that corresponds with documented behavior of the Clowns associated with [http://www.scp-wiki.net/herman-fuller-hub Herman Fuller's Circus of the Disquieting.] [[footnote]] Internally designated GoI-233[[/footnote]] MTF Pi-6 "Clown Wranglers" were dispatched to the scene, where they retrieved SCP-4459 and SCP-4459-A. The on-scene law enforcement officer underwent amnestic treatment and was issued cover story Epsilon-Delta 12 "False Report: Domestic Incident". The two belligerents were taken into custody and later amnesticized and released after interviews determined that they exhibited no anomalous behavior outside of the influence of SCP-4459.

The anomalous properties of SCP-4459 only become apparent when worn. SCP-4459 and SCP-4459-A collectively are host to an esotheric entity identifying as "Fraust". This entity claims that at some point in the past it was imprisoned via anomalous means inside the hat and its corresponding box by the ringmaster of GoI-233.

Any non-anomalous human wearing the hat becomes possessed by this entity and begins to exhibit several anomalous abilities that they would not normally be able to express. These abilities correspond with documented behaviors attributed to the entities known as Clowns that are primarily associated with GoI-233.[[footnote]]For a full account of these behaviors and abilities, please see GoI-233 Archived Document //Known Behaviors and Practices of Homo Sapiens Prodigiosus//, by Dr. Simon Klaus.[[/footnote]]

SCP-4459 and SCP-4459-A were collected along with numerous items of clothing that are assumed to have belonged to C. H. Wilkerson, the deceased former owner of ████ Tallyho Lane Madison, WI. While most of the clothing collected were of an antiquated design and style, none exhibited anomalous properties. These items were initially slated for disposal, but after a request from the SCP-4459 Head Researcher, these items were retained pursuant to the revised containment procedures.

On July 21, 2017 SCP-4459 breached containment during a routine cleaning of their containment area. D-2101 had been tasked with janitorial duties in that section, and during the completion of their task, put on SCP-4459.  After a few moments, SCP-4459 returned all of the clothing to the wardrobe before shifting into an incorporeal state and vanishing up through the ceiling.  The hume level fluctuation generated by this shift triggered the containment alert, but site security was unable to prevent SCP-4459 from leaving.

MTF Pi-6 "Clown Wranglers" were activated, and they proceeded to attempt to locate and re-contain SCP-4459 which they initially failed to do. During the course of their following investigation, members of Pi-6 returned to Madison, WI in an attempt to track down SCP-4459. Evidence was found that SCP-4459 had been visiting the grave site of C. H. Wilkerson, and several items were retrieved from the scene.

and I am not sure what that really meant. I do know that Cahaya is struggling to find a purpose here at the Circus, and I really want to help them find a place. Poodles and Squigly are very supportive of my endeavors to make a home here for Cahaya, and I was --surprised that-- Of course **they** would be supportive. They always considered me a younger sibling, and they wanted the best for me. I do not think they ever expected me to find such comfort in the arms of a human, much less one that was not even "different", but what can you say? All I know is that I want the best for Cahaya, even if that means I ultimately must let them leave.

Icky came to me with a suggestion today. She has always been curious about how resistant Cahaya is to the more dangerous side effects of Milk, and she suggested that we try feeding them a less-dilute version than [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1921 the Candy.] I am not sure this is the best route to take, but Cahaya seemed really excited about the prospect.

It took a few days, but Cahaya was finally able to get up and walk around. While not as resilient as we are, I was surprised at how little the fall actually hurt them. I keep asking Cahaya to either take it easy or allow Dick to finish the transformation, but they still do not want to accept the full conversion. I think that they are afraid that becoming a Clown would make them different. I tried telling Cahaya that I would love them anyway, but I can tell that they really are worried that they would become something else. I guess I can understand that.

On July 28th, 2017 SCP-4459 manifested at the grave site once again, but did not leave anything behind. MTF Pi-6 were able to surround and apprehend SCP-4459 without incident. 

After SCP-4459 was returned to containment, several attempts were made to conduct another interview, but SCP-4459 refused to speak to anyone. Eventually Dr. Stewart was able to convince SCP-4459 to cooperate with a final interview.
