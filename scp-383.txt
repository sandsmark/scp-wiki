**Item #:** SCP-383

**Object Class:** Safe/Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** All samples of SCP-383 must be kept in standard airtight, plastic containers frozen into ice blocks, and stored in a locker kept at -5 degrees Celsius at all times. All samples of SCP-383 removed for testing must be handled with a minimum safety equipment of a face mask, latex gloves, and protective goggles (optional if personnel already wear prescription glasses.)

All suspected and confirmed infections of SCP-383 will be treated with personnel, and anyone they have had direct contact within the frame of infection, placed into quarantine for the duration of testing. A confirmed case of SCP-383 will result in personnel being placed under a week-long quarantine and placed on mild antibiotics until testing reveals that SCP-383 is fully flushed from the system. Infected civilians are to be treated similarly, and given a Class B Amnesiac, and told that they are in quarantine for a highly virulent new strain of the flu, and the cause of the outbreak must be identified.

All objects created by SCP-383 must be catalogued, along with the current state of the host.

For obvious security reasons, SCP-383 may not be introduced to any other SCP's.

**Description:** SCP-383 is a viral infection, first categorized as a variant of influenza. The initial symptoms of SCP-383 are similar to those of the common cold, ranging through a variety of aches and pains, sinus issues, sore throat, upset stomach, coughing and sneezing, and fatigue. It appears to only be capable of infecting human hosts, but has been observed to be carried by other animals, such as rats and pigeons. Similar to a common infection, SCP-383 will work it's way through the human body naturally within' a few days, or faster with routine antibiotics.

However, SCP-383 is also accompanied by extreme waves of nausea. Rather than bringing up the contents of the host's stomach, rather, SCP-383 appears to be capable of, through unknown means, produce random items. These items are always sized appropriately to the host's mouth, even if it appears infeasible for them to originate from the stomach, suggesting that these items are actually produced either in the mouth or throat. More often then not, these items are useful, individually, to the host.

For example, a host inside of a locked room may regurgitate a key, or a lockpick set, or a crowbar to pry the door open. While the results are far from consistent, the only pattern shown is that SCP-383 always produces items of use to the host in one way or another. SCP-383 has even been observed to create living animals and complex mechanical devices. Few items seem different from a normal counterpart, though, with a few notable exceptions.

Although SCP-383 may seem useful in a pinch, recurrent infections can cause damage to the mouth and esophagus, and a weakening of the immune system.
