title:Criticism Policy
This is our site criticism policy, which lays out how everyone is expected to behave. It is currently a work in progress, and is enforced at staff discretion.

Please do not try to enforce these guidelines on other users yourself. Violations can be reported via a PM to an active moderator or administrator (listed in the [[[Guide to Newbies]]]).

**Rules**

These are the hard-and-fast rules that you are expected to know and follow. They fall under "don't be a dick" in our [[[Site Rules]]].

# **Don't be an asshole.** This is the big one. You don't need to be nice, but don't go full out asshole. Don't tell someone they're an idiot, or their idea is worthless. If it's just a mediocre idea, don't start, well, flaming them. Just say it's a mediocre idea. The point is to deliver effective criticism, not to show how cleverly you can call someone a moron.
 * That being said, being harsh is not the same as being an asshole, even being //very// harsh. See Guidelines below. 
# **Critique the work, don't attack the writer.** Back to the 'no flaming' thing. Stick to criticizing the works of writers. Talk about what is actually in the article that does or doesn't work, and go from there. As an example, you can tell the author, "This needs work, the idea's fine except X, and you need to cut out the addenda." Don't say, "You're a terrible writer. Why did you post this?"
 * You //can// criticize all of a writer's works, of course, or what they did in the work.
 * Feel free to suggest that the author do things like consult certain resources ([[[Guide Hub | guides and essays]]], [http://scpsandbox2.wikidot.com/ the sandbox], [[[Chat Guide | the chat]]], [[[forum:start | the forums]]], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page Wikipedia], etc.), or spend more time reading the site, but don't be an asshole about it, as outlined above.
# **Your posts must contain some kind of content.** Even "meh" counts as content, because it succinctly expresses "this didn't grab me". So does "I agree with what so-and-so said". An emoticon, an insulting macro, or "lol" is not content, it's spam. On that note...
# **Don't tell the author "The problems with this article should be obvious."** If they were obvious to the author, they wouldn't have made them. If you say something like that, you may as well not have posted, even if you're //right//. All you've accomplished is to obliquely call the author an idiot for not having seen the flaws. Keep in mind that a lot of authors haven't been here long. They've read a fair number of articles, but they haven't been through all the failures. They haven't had a chance to see the mechanics of making an SCP article. What's obvious to you is probably not obvious to an outsider.

**Guidelines**

# **Critiques should be helpful in some way**, big or small. It should suggest what the author did wrong, how to improve, or what they've done right that they should continue doing.
# **You aren't required to post anything in-depth.** Sometimes, all you can say is an article didn't grab you. "I didn't care for it," "I dislike this idea", or even just "Meh" are valid criticisms. Maybe you can't articulate exactly why it didn't grab you. That's fair. Not every article flies, and sometimes there's nothing outstandingly good or bad about the article. Or sometimes you just don't like it.
# **If you can't say something nice, say it anyway. Feel free to be as harsh as you need to be.** If an article is pretty bad, you don't have to say nice things to make up for your criticisms. Again, the point is for your criticism to be effective, not to fluff someone's ego. If you can find good things to talk about (and most articles have at least something that was done right), it's great to let the author know, so you can help them build a good mental picture of what they need to work on. But you don't have to. If most of the article's bad, you don't need to search for something good to say.
# **You aren't obligated to explain your vote.** A downvote (or an upvote!) can speak for itself. No one's paying any of us to correct other people's mistakes. We're all volunteers, and no one expects you to criticize every article that gets posted. If you have the time and inclination, that's wonderful, and we appreciate that you're taking the time to help make the site better. But you don't have to.
# **It's fine to just agree with someone else.** If someone else has pointed out the problems of an article? You //can// say "This is bad for the reasons so-and-so posted." If you just want to piggy-back on someone else, that's fine. You're giving more weight to their post with your agreement. You can also reiterate it if you want to approach it from a different tack. But don't feel you have to be silent just because someone's said what you want to say. Let your voice be heard.
# **Avoid saying "don't."** It's better to say "I downvoted because you did X," or "it's a bad idea to do X." If you say "don't do this" you're implying it's a rule (unless there is, in fact, a rule they're breaking). For example, "Don't post without using a sandbox." There's no rule saying someone //must// use a sandbox, or swear off writing humanoids/-Js/Keters until they're more experienced. They probably //should//. But they don't have to.
# **Don't say that you're saving a copy of a bad article to laugh at later.** The author is probably embarrassed enough from the poor reception. You are allowed to save a copy if you //must//, but don't go advertising it or rubbing it in their face.
# **Avoid dogpiling on bad articles.** If it's at -50 and dropping, and twenty people have already said it's terrible, you don't need to drop in just to let people know that you think it's terrible too. If you have real criticism for it, that's fine. But you don't need to talk just to make yourself heard.

If you have any questions about this policy, please feel free to leave a comment in the discussion thread, or message a member of staff. Thank you.
