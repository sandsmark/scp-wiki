This is the fourth Medhesian tourist video created by Oneiroi West to encourage cross-mind travel as part of the de-collectivism initiative in 40561. I do NOT own the rights to this video but I couldn't find it anywhere else, so I figured I'd upload it. I checked the Midhesian node but it's down. It's kind of creepy looking at these formerly funny god awful videos in retrospect, as no one has been to Midhesia in years. Nobody is even talking about it.

Like and subscribe for more creepy content.

Midhesia is just a dumb alternate reality game that nobody ever played. Spreading this kind of information is dangerous. The implications here make Oneiroi harass corporeals. Take this video down. It gives the ARG community a bad name. Midhesia isn't a real place.

And... don't read these comments. It's a shit show.

Only "older" corporeal s will get this. I don't think any of my Oneiroi dream friends remember Midhesia... they only let real people go there.

I don't get it. Is Midhesia an ARG, or is Midhesia a place? I hear people talk about it both ways. I remember reading a Wikipedia entry about it.

My family relies on people thinking of New Super Luigi U, and people are forgetting it even exists. Please spread awareness on my ThinkSpace page. Thank you. If people forget New Super Luigi U for the Wii U I will float into the ether of the Collective and dissolve into each of the Oneiroi Collective's tortured and impossible amalgams... Please visit 🍮[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Super_Luigi_U Scotch.Thinkspace.OW]. You do NOT need New Super Mario Bros to play it [https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/New_Super_Luigi_U (source)]. It only started off as a DLC. Just so you remember New Super Luigi U came out in 2015 in meatspace and received moderate reviews on content aggregator **[READ MORE]**

I went to Midhesia once. I think the dreamspace isn't there anymore because its dreamer died. I think his name was Bill. He liked to take sailing vacations to the Philippines while he was in real life. 

I have heard of another island paradise sort of dream space called "Mayday" and it's also open to everyone. Open yourself to the Mayday.OW node to begin the joining.

|| Midhesia is a honeypot. A Xiupanian space with a candy coating. Go there, and your subconscious is removed - if you're human. You're just completely killed if you're a Oneiroi. These types of realms are everywhere. Just stay in Oneiroi West. Qi Shao actively[[image cursor.gif  width="7px"]] ||

Midhesia is in truth not that different than Xiupania. The only difference is there's water instead of the floating void space. It's a bit sunnier as well. I created Midhesia and several other honeypots to lure human visitors of the dream world and create more Xiupanian copies. I'm a little confused why the Foundation is sending its agents to disrupt this process as they set it in motion to begin with. Do you remember me Dr. Glass? I'm doing as you asked... Maybe your agent has gone rogue? This is big brain stuff that is probably beyond me.

I will still eat the dreams until they're gone. [[span style="color:#868686"]]You won't have to worry about the big unsecured neural network that is Oneiroi space.[[/span]] [[span style="color:#d9d9d9"]]But there are a lot of dreams to eat. A deal is a deal and my word is my[[/span]]
