__//This is a test log of several creatures produced by SCP-1420. Most unstable creatures are omitted apart from the earliest specimens. The format is as follows://__

**Specimen name**
> **Description:** A physical description of the specimen.
> **Behavior:** Description of overall behavior and/or demeanor of the specimen.
> **Notes:** Additional notes about the specimen.


**SCP-1420-1-1**
> **Description:** An extremely muscular snake with a clawed prehensile tail and two legs. 408 grams.
> **Behavior:**Paced rapidly around the room attempting to climb the walls. Expired approximately 4 minutes after birth due to lack of vascular circulation.
> **Notes:** Anomalous effect of SCP-1420 ascertained.

**SCP-1420-1-2**
> **Description:** An infant domestic chicken. Completely devoid of feathers and lacking eyes or toes.
> **Behavior:**Convulsed on the testing table until it began to relax. Laid still until terminated.
> **Notes:** SCP-1420 seems to produce flawed creatures.

**SCP-1420-1-16**
> **Description:**  Twelve-legged reptilian with a feathered tail. 410 grams.
> **Behavior:** Moved quickly around the testing room and hissed at researchers. Spat a foul-smelling liquid. Kept alive for one week by being fed with live mice. Terminated without incident.
> **Notes:** First fully stable creature produced by SCP-1420.

**SCP-1420-1-18**
> **Description:**  Slender bipedal avian creature with a scaled tail and opposable thumbs.  300 grams.
> **Behavior:** Very timid around researchers and attempted to stay away from them or hide behind table legs. 
> **Notes:** Kept alive for one week by being fed bird seed and kept in a terrarium. Terminated without incident. Some of these creatures might make decent on-site pets. Formally requesting permission to keep one alive for an extended period of time to study long-term behavior.

//**Site Directors note:** Permission Granted to keep an instance of SCP-1420-1 alive in a terrarium as long as deemed necessary. Do not remove the specimen from the containment room.//

**SCP-1420-1-19**
> **Description:**  Four-legged, stocky, large-scaled creature resembling a pangolin. Scales are serrated and very sharp. No visible eyes. Large ears. Large, short beak for feeding. 456 grams.
> **Behavior:** Completely blind and only reacts to sound and physical touch. Arches its back when threatened and flares its scales. Emits a quite rumbling sound when threatened. Kept alive for one month in a terrarium fed with nuts and fruits. Terminated without incident.
> **Notes:** Instances of SCP-1420-1 are definitely becoming more complex and increasingly stable. I will study their behavior in increasing detail.

**SCP-1420-1-28**
> **Description:**  A snakelike, feathered reptilian with 18 long scales used as legs. Six large eyes running from its forehead to the base of its neck. 432 grams.
> **Behavior:** Relatively calm. Slept a majority of the time. No venom or fangs. Ate lab mice by pinning them between its legs and swallowing them whole. Kept alive for one month to study. Terminated without incident.
> **Notes:** Many of these specimens seem to be relatively docile. Formally requesting permission to cross-test instances of SCP-1420-1.

//**Site Directors Note:** Cross-testing of specimens permitted.//


__**SCP-1420-1 Cross-Testing**__
__**Specimens Used:**__

**SCP-1420-1-39**
> **Description:** A round creature with 5 legs separated at equal distances on the body. Limbs end in small beaks. 350 grams
> **Behavior:** The specimen moves by rolling along the ground and latching onto surfaces with its mouths. Does not seem to differentiate between things larger or smaller than it. Has weak venom that causes numbness.
> **Notes:** I think that this specimen may feed similarly to a leech.

**SCP-1420-1-40**
> **Description:** A large-mouthed lizard with serrated teeth and six tentacle-like appendages coming from its back. Soft feathered body. Four clawed legs. 400 grams
> **Behavior:** Highly aggressive. Uses tentacles to grip a target and constrain them.
> **Notes:** This is quite obviously a predatory creature.

__**Result of Cross-Test:**__ After both specimens were placed in a terrarium, Specimen 40 attacked Specimen 39 almost immediately. Specimen 40 devoured Specimen 39 and promptly ran under a decorative tree branch in the terrarium. Specimen 40 terminated without incident.

__**Notes:**__ The specimens don’t seem to recognize each other as coming from the same origin. Additional testing is required.
