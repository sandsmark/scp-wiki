**Item #:** SCP-5000

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** A circular perimeter has been established around SCP-5000 with a 0.5 km radius.

**Description:** SCP-5000 is an industrial complex formerly designated Foundation Site-00, located in Marin County, California, United States of America. SCP-5000 exhibits an Indra^^##red|1##^^-class antimemetic effect within a radius of approximately 50m that increases in intensity the closer one gets to SCP-5000. This eventually renders observation of the interior of SCP-5000 impossible.

SCP-5000 was the first Foundation building to be commissioned by the Administrator. However, it never entered full operation. Records show that it was completed on 1898-12-01, at which point its anomalous properties appeared to have manifested. 

SCP-5000's date of completion is noted as roughly coinciding with the approximate time period of the Administrator's disappearance.

**Special Containment Procedures:** A circular perimeter has been established around SCP-5000 with a 0.5 km radius.

##blue|The informational construct that SCP-5000 represents has been selected to undergo Metcalf-Bakke reverse imaging. Testing will be conducted on a biweekly basis.##

**Description:** SCP-5000 is an industrial complex formerly designated Foundation Site-00, located in Marin County, California, United States of America. SCP-5000 exhibits a ##blue|Brahma##^^##red|1##^^-class antimemetic effect within a radius of approximately 50m that increases in intensity the closer one gets to SCP-5000.

##blue|**Addendum 5000-1:** Metcalf-Bakke reverse imaging is a recently developed process accepted by conventional neuroscience.##

##blue|Conventional science has proven that long-term memory consolidation in animals is facilitated by microscopic structural changes in the central nervous system (CNS).^^####red|2##^^##blue| Metcalf-Bakke reverse imaging extrapolates information from an sapient organism's memory from these structural changes, which is then subject to statistical analysis by Foundation neural network I/O-BOREALIS to retrieve a summary of its contents. This allows for indirect observation of certain antimemetic anomalies.##

"Although Brahma-class antimemes appear superficially similar to Indra-class antimemes, they exhibit a net positive contribution to the informational substrate of the universe. However, these interactions are usually latent and unable to be retrieved from informational constructs. Evidence exists, however, that retrieving this information is possible via extrapolation from the memory banks of sapient entities."

Following the success of this trial, the Metcalf-Bakke process was upgraded with the addition of the familiarity coefficient ξ, a value that measures the degree of familiarity to a particular stimulus based on previous learning. The familiarity coefficient is 0 for completely unfamiliar stimuli and increases by 1 for each successfully consolidated memory.

Following the results of the February 6 test, additional Metcalf-Bakke trials were ordered on SCP-5000.

On 2019-02-07, D-922358, D-704734, and D-104155 were exposed to the interior of SCP-5000 and subsequently tested for their Metcalf-Bakke ξ-values of the antimeme.

On 2019-02-08, similar trials were conducted with willing non-D-class personnel to identify if this phenomenon was limited to D-class. Junior Researcher Dr. Sania Suyardeva, Senior Researcher Dr. Joseph Russo, and Mobile Task Force Captain Alfred Lopez de la Fuentes volunteered, were exposed to the interior of SCP-5000, and subsequently tested for their Metcalf-Bakke ξ-values of the antimeme. 

On 2019-02-09, the Ethics Committee authorized, in a 7-2-4 vote, the use of non-willing subjects in Metcalf-Bakke trials regarding SCP-5000 unaffiliated with the Foundation to identify if this phenomenon was limited to Foundation personnel. Seung-min Oh, Zoey Powell, Haile Senai, and Shawn Hawkins were selected for testing, exposed to the interior of SCP-5000, and subsequently tested for their Metcalf-Bakke ξ-values of the antimeme.

On 2019-02-10, Overwatch Command authorized, in a 6-3-4 vote, the circumvention of standard Foundation protocol and exposure of an Overseer to SCP-5000. O5-11 volunteered, was exposed to the interior of SCP-5000, and subsequently tested for their Metcalf-Bakke ξ-values of the antimeme. 

Results were as follows:
||~ Subject ||~ ξ-value||
|| D-922358 || 1.000 ||
|| D-704734 || 1.000 ||
|| D-104155 ||1.000 ||
|| Sania Suyardeva || 1.000 ||
|| Joseph Russo || 1.000 ||
|| Alfred Lopez de la Fuentes || 1.000 ||
|| Seung-min Oh || 0.000 ||
|| Zoey Powell || 0.000 ||
|| Haile Senai || 0.000 ||
|| Shawn Hawkins || 0.000 ||
|| O5-11 || 1.000 ||

In all of the Foundation-affiliated subjects who exhibited familiarity with SCP-5000, analysis of their Metcalf-Bakke indices revealed that first exposure had been established some time prior to their employment at the Foundation.

**Item #:** SCP-5000

**Object Class:** ##blue|Archon##

**Special Containment Procedures:** A circular perimeter has been established around SCP-5000 with a 0.5 km radius. ##blue|Biweekly expeditions into SCP-5000 are to be conducted to monitor the status of SCP-5000-A.##

##blue|SCP-5000-Δ is inherently uncontainable.##

**Description:** SCP-5000 is an industrial complex formerly designated Foundation Site-00,  located in Marin County, California, United States of America. SCP-5000 exhibits a ##blue|Vedas##^^##red|1##^^-class antimemetic effect within a radius of approximately 50m that increases in intensity the closer one gets to SCP-5000. This eventually renders observation of the interior of SCP-5000 impossible.

SCP-5000 was the first Foundation building to be commissioned by the Administrator. However, it never entered full operation. Records show that it was completed on 1898-12-01, at which point its anomalous properties appeared to have manifested. 

SCP-5000's date of completion is noted as roughly coinciding with the approximate time period of the Administrator's disappearance.

##blue|5000-Ishvara events are moments of causality that occur inside of SCP-5000. Due to the antimemetic nature of SCP-5000, little information on 5000-Ishvara events is known. What is known, however, indicates that:##
* ##blue|5000-Ishvara events may affect any individual at any time.##
* ##blue|5000-Ishvara events consist of the subject's (hereafter designated SCP-5000-1) spontaneous disappearance and subsequent reappearance inside SCP-5000.##
* ##blue|5000-Ishvara events result in the inevitable employment of the SCP-5000-1 instance at the Foundation 1-2 years following its occurrence.##

##blue|It has been confirmed that 100% of Foundation employees of the past, present, and future have experienced or will experience a 5000-Ishvara event.##

##blue|The synthesis of the latent mnestic drug M-48195, codenamed "Turkic Red", has allowed limited exploration of the interior of SCP-5000 and the subsequent discovery of SCP-5000-A. SCP-5000-A is a crack approximately 5.6m in length and 1.2m in width, running along the floor of the central room of SCP-5000. A light emanating from an unknown source can be seen glowing at the bottom of the crack, and intermittent metallic screeching can be heard from inside. Nothing that has entered SCP-5000-A has ever been recovered.##

##blue|Since its discovery, the size of SCP-5000-A, the brightness of the light source coming from within SCP-5000-A, and the loudness and frequency of the metallic screeching have all increased at a non-linear rate. No methods of slowing or reversing these processes are known.##

##blue|SCP-5000-Δ designates the existence of the SCP Foundation. Due to the role of SCP-5000 in its inception and continued existence, the SCP Foundation must be classified as an anomaly.##
