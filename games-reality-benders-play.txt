title:Games Reality Benders Play
The old man stands over her hospital bed, staring down at the girl. She is wired to all sorts of machines, beeping and booping, all of them designed to keep her alive. All of them unneeded. He leans over the better, a pleasant smile on his face. "You can get up now."

The girl scrunches her eyes tightly together, not looking at him. "Go 'way! 'M in a coma!"

The older gentleman tsks at her words. "Now, you may have the mundane believing that, but you and I both know better. Come on, lazy bones, get up now!"

The girl opens one eyelid halfway, peering at the man. He looks so pleasant and charming, like her grandfather! But there's something about him, something the...what did he call them, mundanes? wouldn't see. A veiled... hatred? "I'm not supposed to leave the bed. The Doctors will get angry." Again.

"No worries, my dear. I'll see to it they never even notice you're gone." He gestures absently with a hand, and the girl feels a tingle in her skin. Sitting up, she notices that there is now another girl in her bed, whom all the instruments are attached to. She eagerly hops out of bed, clapping her hands.

"Yey! Thank you, poppy." 

"Hmm, yes. Now, we can't have you going out and about in that dreadful hospial gown, can we?" He ponders for a moment, trying to decide what would be most appropriate, but even as he thinks, the little girl bobs her head, and is dressed in jeans and a t-shirt. "Well. Someone has more control then we were given to think. Tell me." Offering her his hand. "Do you know what you are?"

"The doctors keep calling me a, uhm, reality bender? It means, I can do anything, right?" She takes his hand warily.

"Hmm, you have grown ready for this. Come, let me show you." And the two of them vanish.

They sit together on a bench, watching the world go by.
