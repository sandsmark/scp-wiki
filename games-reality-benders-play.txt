title:Games Reality Benders Play
The old man stands over her hospital bed, staring down at the girl. She is wired to all sorts of machines, beeping and booping, all of them designed to keep her alive. All of them unneeded. He leans over the better, a pleasant smile on his face. "You can get up now."

The girl scrunches her eyes tightly together, not looking at him. "Go 'way! 'M in a coma!"

The older gentleman tsks at her words. "Now, you may have the mundane believing that, but you and I both know better. Come on, lazy bones, get up now!"

The girl opens one eyelid halfway, peering at the man. He looks so pleasant and charming, like her grandfather! But there's something about him, something the...what did he call them, mundanes? wouldn't see. A veiled... hatred? "I'm not supposed to leave the bed. The Doctors will get angry." Again.

"No worries, my dear. I'll see to it they never even notice you're gone." He gestures absently with a hand, and the girl feels a tingle in her skin. Sitting up, she notices that there is now another girl in her bed, whom all the instruments are attached to. She eagerly hops out of bed, clapping her hands.

"Yey! Thank you, poppy." 

"Hmm, yes. Now, we can't have you going out and about in that dreadful hospital gown, can we?" He ponders for a moment, trying to decide what would be most appropriate, but even as he thinks, the little girl bobs her head, and is dressed in jeans and a t-shirt. "Well. Someone has more control then we were given to think. Tell me." Offering her his hand. "Do you know what you are?"

"The doctors keep calling me a, uhm, reality bender? It means, I can do anything, right?" She takes his hand warily.

"Hmm, you have grown ready for this. Come, let me show you." And the two of them vanish.

They sit together on a bench, watching the world go by. It is a horrible world, where mankind has been reduced to a more primal state. They hug the light, and fear the darkness, for terrible things exist in the darkness. Sitting on the park bench, the old man and the little girl watch as creatures of nightmare stalk the shadows, waiting to find a lone human, and take them.

"Where are we?" She asks, innocently. She knows nothing here can hurt her, knows it in her heart, and so it must be true.

"A future." He responds flippantly.

"Don't you mean, THE future?" She corrects him, in that know it all tone little children have.

"No child, I mean, A future. This is not necessarily the future that occurs, it is simply the one I choose to show you. It could just as easily be this one." And with a wave of his hands, they are sitting in a utopia, the sun shining, the people laughing and smiling, no sick, or injured, everything... perfect. 

The girl studies the people, then looks up at the old man. "So, Reality Benders can travel to the future?"

He winces, shaking his head a little sadly. "Please! We prefer the term, Shapers."

"But aren't we Reality Benders?"

He coughs into his hand. "Well, you see, it's like the difference between using the word African over the word Negro. While both are correct terminology, one is more polite, and one wasn't given to us by people who aren't us."

She frowns in concentration, then nods slowly. "I think I get it. But, why Shapers?"

He laughers. "Well, we have to call ourselves something, don't we? And we do Shape things to our whim."

"But, the future?"

"Like a dog with a bone, you. Very well then. No, we Shapers cannot travel in time, as such. We can view other times, and affect them, to some degree, but we are bound from actually traveling to them." He puffs lightly on his pipe as he speaks.

"So, you mean, we can make things happen here, but not actually touch things?" It's hard to keep up sometimes, but then she just imagines herself getting it, and she does.

"That's it exactly!" It would sound like praise, to any one else. But she hears the edge in it.

"Why?"

"Ah, to understand that, you must under stand the Game. And to understand the Game, you must know the pieces. The major pieces, are, of course, us, the Shapers. Then there are the Shaped, the normal, everyday people, who do our bidding." He gestures at the people walking around them. "Then there are the Unshaped. You might know them better as SCPs. They are those things that appear at random, with odd powers, that can be used to further our plans, or thwart the plans of another. And, finally, the Unshapeable. Those who cannot directly be shaped by our powers. Unshapeables can be born, or, on rare occasions, made."
