**Item:** SCP-3781

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** On October 11, 1999, all of SCP-3781's publicly available servers were shut down and removed from the Internet. All search results, screenshots, and links for SCP-3781 were completely removed from the Internet. Using IP addresses gathered from the game's database, all players of SCP-3781 were tracked down, detained, and released after being administered Class C amnestics.

A single private server has been preserved and is hosted at Site-15 for experimental purposes. All requests for testing must be forwarded to Dr. Yamamoto.

**Description:** SCP-3781 is a Japanese massively multiplayer online game titled //OK Painter!// (OK ペインター!), developed and published in 1999 by Tokyo-based independent video game studio PaintSoft. Prior to the Foundation's discovery and subsequent shutdown of SCP-3781, the game had a monthly average of 10,000 players with a peak of 15,536 on ██/██/1999; 100% of players were located within Tokyo Prefecture.

SCP-3781 utilizes pixel art graphics in a style similar to other online games released in the early 2000s.[[footnote]] Researchers noted visual similarities to //Habbo// (formerly //Habbo Hotel//), a Finnish social networking service released one year after SCP-3781. However, most humanoid characters in SCP-3781 aside from player avatars have realistic proportions. [[/footnote]] The game assumes a vertically scrolling perspective during primary gameplay and an isometric 2-dimensional perspective in the main hub and during cutscenes.

Players assume control of "Painters", white humanoid creatures drawn in the Japanese "super-deformed" cartoon style with large, ovular red noses and seemingly closed eyes. Painters serve as the player's avatar and their appearance and attire is widely customizable. Each Painter is equipped with a paint brush and paint bucket, which can be upgraded, as well as a color of paint customizable to the player's preference.

The primary objective in SCP-3781 is to gain rewards and upgrades through scaling various buildings in Tokyo using paint while avoiding obstacles and/or other players. From the main hub, players can move freely around the city of Tokyo, where they can select a building and play in one of three game modes: Solo, Race, or Time Trial. Regardless of game mode, reaching a balcony or roof of a building represents a "checkpoint" where players can choose between advancing further up the building or returning to the building entrance. Upon choosing to return, a text box appears prompting the player to "leave a cool message" with the options YES and NO.

Choosing YES prompts the player to type a phrase, quote or lyrics from their favorite movie, television show, video game, novel, song, or other form of media into the provided space. Upon entering the phrase, a cutscene occurs wherein the Painter paints the phrase onto the wall (or floor if on the rooftop) in the format "OK Painter, [inputted phrase] !" Immediately following this, an event involving the Painter is depicted that alludes to the work associated with the inputted phrase.


Approximately 33 minutes and 19 seconds later, the effect produced upon the Painter is followed by an analogous event at a random real-world location. Further testing has suggested that locations of said events are related to the country from which the work referenced by the inputted phrase originates.

The following experiment logs are all translated from Japanese. All times are in Japanese Standard Time (JST) unless otherwise noted.

**Test 01--**10/12/99, 14:23
**Subject:** Researcher Toriyama
**Phrase:**"OK Painter, Special Beam Cannon! !"
**Results:** The Painter gains a green complexion and replaces its customized outfit with a white cape with shoulder guards and a white turban. The Painter touches a hand to its forehead, then expels a bright energy beam bounded by rings of light into the distance. A small explosion is observed in the far left corner of the background.
**Notes:** On October 12, 1999 at 14:56, an abrupt 5000% increase in nuclear radiation levels was detected for 13.39 seconds within a 10-cm-wide area of space across a strawberry field outside of ████████, a town in Ibaraki Prefecture. Two hundred and twenty-three (223) strawberry plants were obliterated by the radiation blast; no animals or human beings were harmed.

**Test 02--**12/28/99, 13:45
**Subject:** Researcher Tajiri
**Phrase:** "OK Painter, ... !"
**Results:** The Painter replaces its custom outfit with a yellow backpack and red baseball cap with a white crown. The Painter then stands in the northernmost corner of the rooftop, facing the background, and remains motionless for approximately 3 minutes, during which snow begins to fall and progressively accumulate. The scene is interrupted by the appearance of another Painter with a gray backpack and striped black-and-yellow baseball cap turned backwards. The second Painter stands directly behind Researcher Okamoto's avatar, who turns to face him, and the screen cuts to black.
**Notes:** On December 28, 1999, at 14:18, Japanese rescue workers found two male schoolchildren, ███████ ██████ and ███████ ██████, stranded on top of Mount Fuji. The two both claimed to become lost when they got distracted by their handheld video games and lost sight of their families. ██████, who was playing the newly released video game //Pokemon Gold Version// on his Game Boy Color handheld console, told rescuers he found ██████, who was playing //Pokemon Silver Version//, and they decided to "kill time together while waiting to be found." The boys had been lost for five hours prior to discovery and were treated for minor symptoms of frostbite. 

**Test 03--**01/25/00, 12:00
**Subject:** Researcher Fujiwara
**Phrase:** "OK Painter, You are already dead. !"
**Results:** A tall, muscular man wearing a blue vest and jeans with a red undershirt and white shoulder pads forcibly breaks through the wall in front of the Painter. The man presses his thumbs into the sides of the Painter's head and speaks in a deep, masculine voice: "I just pressed your hidden pressure point. Your life ends seven seconds from now. Use this time to reflect on your sins." The Painter runs around the rooftop with a distressed facial expression for approximately 7 seconds before abruptly clutching its head and collapsing onto the floor. The screen turns red as a loud, high-pitched warbling tone plays, followed by the sound of an explosion and splattering noises. The word "HIDEBU!!" is displayed on the screen in white hiragana characters. The scene reverts to normal as the Painter stands up again, rubbing the sides of its head.
**Notes:** On January 25, 2000 at 12:33, Japanese news station ███'s breaking news segment covered the murder in broad daylight of ██████ Kazuma, a Yakuza member involved in a series of murders and human trafficking operations across Japan's Kantō region. Kazuma was apprehended and assaulted in the Harajuku district of Shibuya, Tokyo by a man "cosplaying" as the character Kenshiro from the //Fist of the North Star// manga and anime series. Video footage showed Kazuma's assailant saying "I just pressed your hidden pressure point. Your life ends seven seconds from now. Use this time to reflect on your sins." This was immediately followed by [REDACTED]. Kazuma's official cause of death was listed as severe head trauma and internal hemorrhage.


**Test 04--** 06/20/00, 19:42 
**Subject:** Researcher Takeuchi
**Phrase:** "OK Painter, You're gonna need a bigger boat. !"
**Results:** Opening shot of cutscene reveals a large swimming pool in the middle of the roof, with a small fishing boat in the middle of the pool. The Painter boards the boat and steers it in brief laps around the pool. Halfway through the third lap, a shark fin appears above the water; immediately upon completing the seventh lap, what appears to be a specimen of //Carcharodon carcharias// (great white shark) emerges and violently consumes the rear half of the boat, causing it to begin sinking. The Painter, eyes wide open with a startled and comically frightened expression, jumps off the boat and swims out of the pool while the shark consumes the rest of the boat.
**Notes:** On June 20th, 2000 at 06:15 EST, an illegal shark hunting vessel called the //Orca// █ miles off the coast of Martha's Vineyard was attacked by a male //Carcharodon carcharias//, compromising the rear portion of the hull and causing the vessel to sink. The three crew members of the //Orca// were rescued by Coast Guard vessels patrolling the area, and were apprehended by law enforcement when they arrived on land.

**Comment:** This is the first anomalous event to occur outside of Japan. Perhaps it was because Jaws is an American film? If so, then this may suggest that the locations of anomalous events depend on the origin of the work referenced by the phrase. We must definitely look into this further. -//Dr. Yamamoto//

**Test 05--** ██/██/01, 08:13:29 EST
**Subject:** Researcher ████████
**Phrase:** "OK Painter, Shanna, they bought their tickets, they knew what they were getting into. I say, let 'em crash. !"
**Result:** [DATA EXPUNGED]
**Notes:** [DATA EXPUNGED]

**Test 68--** 07/25/08, 10:28
**Subject:** Researcher Morinaga
**Phrase:** "OK Painter, …they were… disgusting… !"
**Results:** N/A 
**Notes:** Testing was abruptly stopped before entering the phrase. Morinaga was sternly reprimanded and other researchers given a warning.

**Comment:** No testing this on other SCPs for the time being. The potential for a containment breach is far too high. //-Dr. Yamamoto//
