**Item #:** SCP-3781

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** On October 11, 1999, all of SCP-3781's publicly available servers were shut down and removed from the Internet. All search results, screenshots, and links for SCP-3781 were completely removed from the Internet. Using IP addresses gathered from the game's database, all players of SCP-3781 were tracked down, detained, and released after being administered Class C amnestics.

A single private server was preserved for experimental purposes. An English translation was produced for personnel at Site-15, where the server is currently hosted as of January 28, 2019. All requests for testing must be forwarded to Dr. Yamamoto.

**Description:** SCP-3781 is a Japanese massively multiplayer online game titled //OK Painter!// (OK ペインター!), developed and published in 1999 by Tokyo-based independent video game studio PaintSoft. The game was online for 6 months prior to the Foundation's discovery and its subsequent shutdown on 
October 11, 1999. Data gathered from the game's database revealed that SCP-3781 had a total of 1,536 players, all of which were located within Tokyo Prefecture.[[footnote]] 98% of players were individuals classified as //hikikomori// (social recluses) by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. This may explain why the game was not more widely known. [[/footnote]]

SCP-3781 utilizes pixel art graphics in a style similar to other online games released in the early 2000s.[[footnote]] Researchers noted visual similarities to //Habbo// (formerly //Habbo Hotel//), a Finnish social networking service released one year after SCP-3781. However, most humanoid characters in SCP-3781 aside from player avatars have realistic proportions. [[/footnote]] The game assumes a vertically scrolling perspective during primary gameplay and an isometric 2-dimensional perspective during cutscenes.

Players assume control of "Painters", white humanoid creatures drawn in the Japanese "super-deformed" cartoon style who are equipped with paint brushes and buckets of paint. Painters serve as the player's avatar and are widely customizable in appearance.

The primary objective in SCP-3781 is to gain rewards and increase in experience level through scaling various buildings in Tokyo using paint while avoiding obstacles and/or other players. Upon reaching level 99 (the maximum level possible), reaching a balcony or rooftop will result in a dialog box reading "Leave a cool message?" and the options YES and NO.


Choosing YES prompts the player to type a phrase or quote associated with a piece of popular culture into the provided space.(See Addendum 3781.1 for additional details.) Upon entering the phrase, a cutscene occurs wherein the Painter paints the phrase onto the wall (or floor if on the rooftop) in the format "OK Painter, [input] !" Immediately following this, an event involving the Painter is depicted that alludes to the work associated with the inputted phrase.


Approximately 33 minutes and 19 seconds later, the effect produced upon the Painter is followed by an analogous event at a random real-world location. Further testing has suggested that locations of said events are related to the country from which the work referenced by the inputted phrase originates.

Choosing YES when asked to "leave a cool message" produces the following prompt:

> Type your favorite phrase from popular culture into the space below. Make sure it's cool!
> |	type your phrase here	|

Phrases must fall within a certain set of criteria to be accepted by SCP-3781. The currently known criteria are as follows:
* SCP-3781 defines "popular culture" as any idea communicated by any form of broadcast, digital, outdoor or print media.
* The work referenced by the phrase must be a fictional narrative. Descriptions of nonfictional events are considered fictional as long as the characters involved are fictional. 
* The referenced work must have been made available to the general public at one point in time. 
* The phrase must have appeared within the referenced work.
* The phrase cannot include the name of the referenced work. Simply entering the title of the work in question (e.g. //Romeo and Juliet// as opposed to "My naked weapon is out.") produces the message "That would be too obvious. Try again!"
* The phrase must be written exactly as it appears in the referenced work, including grammar and punctuation. Typing a misquoted phrase (e.g. "Luke, I am your father." instead of "No, I am your father."), produces the message "That's not quite right. Try again!"

[[collapsible show="Addendum 3781.2: Experiment Logs" hide="Close addendum"]]
The following experiment logs are all translated from Japanese. All times listed are in Japanese Standard Time (JST) unless otherwise noted.

**Test 01--**10/12/99, 14:23
**Player:** Researcher Toriyama
**Input:**"OK Painter, Special Beam Cannon! !"
**Results:** The Painter gains a green complexion and replaces its customized outfit with a white cape with shoulder guards and a white turban. The Painter touches a hand to its forehead, then expels a bright energy beam bounded by rings of light into the distance. A small explosion is observed in the far left corner of the background.
**Notes:** On October 12, 1999 at 14:56, an abrupt ██████% increase in nuclear radiation levels was detected for 13.39 seconds within a 10 cm^^2^^wide area of space across a strawberry field outside of ████████, a town in Ibaraki Prefecture. Two hundred and twenty-three (223) strawberry plants were obliterated by the radiation blast; no animals or human beings were harmed.

**Test 02--**12/28/99, 13:45
**Player:** Researcher Tajiri
**Input:** "OK Painter, ... ...[[footnote]] Dialogue of the character Red in //Pokemon Gold Version// and //Pokemon Silver Version// prior to battle. Red's dialogue in these games consists  solely of ellipses. [[/footnote]] !"
**Results:** The Painter replaces its custom outfit with a yellow backpack and red baseball cap with a white crown. It then stands in the northernmost corner of the rooftop, turns its back to the player, and remains motionless for approximately 3 minutes, during which snow begins to fall and progressively accumulate. After 3 minutes a second Painter with a gray backpack and striped black-and-yellow baseball cap turned backwards reaches the rooftop. The second Painter stands directly behind the first, who turns to face him, and the screen cuts to black.
**Notes:** On December 28, 1999, at 14:18, Japanese rescue workers found two male schoolchildren, ███████ ██████ and ███████ ██████, stranded on top of Mount Fuji. The two claimed to become lost when they got distracted by their handheld video games and lost sight of their families. ██████, who was playing the newly released //Pocket Monsters: Gold// on his Game Boy Color, told rescuers he found ██████, who was playing //Pocket Monsters: Silver//, and they decided to "battle each other to pass the time." [[footnote]] Both boys had reached the area in their respective games known as "Mt. Silver", which appears to be loosely based on Mount Fuji. [[/footnote]]The boys had been lost for five hours prior to discovery and were treated for minor symptoms of frostbite. 

**Test 03--**01/25/00, 12:00
**Player:** Researcher Fujiwara
**Input:** "OK Painter, You are already dead. !"
**Results:** A tall, muscular man wearing a blue vest and jeans with a red undershirt and white shoulder pads forcibly breaks through the wall in front of the Painter. The man presses his thumbs into the sides of the Painter's head and speaks: "I just pressed your hidden pressure point. Your life ends seven seconds from now. Use this time to reflect on your sins." The Painter runs around the rooftop with a distressed facial expression for approximately 7 seconds before clutching its head and collapsing. The screen turns red as a loud, high-pitched warbling tone plays, followed by the sound of an explosion and splattering noises. The word "ひでぶっ!!" is displayed on the screen in large white letters.
**Notes:** On January 25, 2000 at 12:33, Japanese news station ███'s breaking news segment covered the murder in broad daylight of ██████ Kazuma, a Yakuza member involved in a series of murders and human trafficking operations across Japan's Kantō region. Kazuma was apprehended and assaulted in the Harajuku district of Shibuya, Tokyo by a man "cosplaying" as the character Kenshiro from the //Fist of the North Star// manga and anime series. Video footage showed Kazuma's assailant saying "I just pressed your hidden pressure point. Your life ends seven seconds from now. Use this time to reflect on your sins." This was immediately followed by [REDACTED]. Kazuma's official cause of death was listed as severe head trauma and internal hemorrhage.


**Test 04--** 06/20/00, 19:42 
**Player:** Researcher Takeuchi
**Input:** "OK Painter, You're gonna need a bigger boat. !"
**Results:** Perspective shifts to reveal a large rooftop swimming pool with a small fishing boat at one end. The Painter boards the boat and steers it in brief laps around the pool. Halfway through the third lap, a shark fin appears above the water; immediately upon completing the seventh lap, what appears to be a specimen of //Carcharodon carcharias// (great white shark) emerges and violently consumes the rear half of the boat, causing it to begin sinking. The Painter, eyes wide open with apparent fear, jumps off the boat and swims out of the pool while the shark consumes the rest of the boat.
**Notes:** On June 20th, 2000 at 06:15 EST, an illegal shark hunting vessel called the //Orca// █ miles off the coast of Martha's Vineyard was attacked by a male //Carcharodon carcharias//, compromising the rear portion of the hull and causing the vessel to sink. The three crew members of the //Orca// were rescued by Coast Guard vessels patrolling the area, and were apprehended by law enforcement when they arrived on land.

**Comment:** This is the first anomalous event to occur outside of Japan. Perhaps it was because Jaws is an American film? If so, then this may suggest that the locations of anomalous events depend on the origin of the work referenced by the phrase. We must definitely look into this further. -//Dr. Yamamoto//

**Test 05--** 07/16/01, 23:03
**Player:** Researcher Amano
**Input:** "OK Painter, That is one big pile of shit. !"
**Result:** An orange //Triceratops// forcibly breaks through the access hatch adjacent to the Painter. It slowly crosses to the other side of the rooftop where it feeds on several potted plants. After finishing its meal, the //Triceratops// defecates loudly, covering the center of the rooftop. It walks back down the acces hatch as the Painter pinches its nose, looking at the screen with a disgusted expression.
**Notes:** On July 16, 2001, at 06:36 PST, a complete fossil of //Triceratops prorsus// was discovered next to a pile of coprolite weighing approximately 1814.369 kilograms in the backyard of film director Steven Spielberg's mansion in Los Angeles, California.

**Comment:** Well, this certainly seems to confirm my suspicions. I must admit I am interested in running a few more tests just to see how what kinds of weird things happen. Let's just try not to cause any international crises! -//Dr. Yamamoto//
