**Founded:** March 2nd, 1959

**Founding Director:** Dr. Nathaniel Bellford

**Location:** Philadelphia, United States of America

**Cover Story:** NASA-owned Assembly and Manufacturing Complex

**Site Function:** Object and Humanoid Containment, Technological Research Application, Anomalous Research and Development, Administrative

**Size:** Area of 14.87km^^2^^

**Purpose:** Site-98 functions as a Research facility dedicated to the study of anomalous items and phenomena as well as aid in containment. Site-98 is involved in a variety of top-secret Foundation projects and classified intel. Site-98 is known for developing ontokinetic technology utilized in Scranton Reality Anchors (SRAs) and Kant Counters and studies in extradimensional travel. Nearly all experiments involved with the Department of Extradimensional Anomalies take place below ground due to the danger posed by each testing.

+++ Sector-A:
Sector-A is a secure area for all Foundation personnel and staff. The layout of this area is defined by the use of Living Facilities, Lounge Areas, Cafeterias, Internal Offices, a Medical Wing, and a Vehicle Bay. Administrative staff members live under Sector-A1; A private area utilized by high-ranking members and isolated from Sector-A. Members of Sector-A1 have access to a conference room, private offices, director's main office, and a library. Anomalous items are restricted from entering Sector-A without proper clearance.

[[include :scp-sandbox-3:image-zoom name=Lab.jpg|caption=Sector-B Dimensional Testing Lab-06. Hover to enlarge.|width=300px|align=right]]

+++ Sector-B:
Sector-B is defined as the primary research and development area. Various laboratories, computer labs, technical maintenance shafts, and databank server rooms are littered throughout the area. Site-98's Department of Extradimensional Anomalies is particularly well-known for their research of advanced dimensional studies and innovations in dimensional travel. Sector-B also functions as a containment zone exclusively for Safe to Euclid Class anomalies.

Sector-B hosts an isolated section (Sector-B2) for E-Class personnel and various other domiciles for those afflicted with anomalous phenomena as a result of accidental exposure. Various projects involving the practical application and weaponization of anomalies are often conducted within this part of the site. Most of this sector is situated above ground with the exception of certain anomalous items and beings capable of causing various K-Class Scenarios which are contained in Sector-C.

+++ Sector-C:
Sector-C focuses mainly on the containment of extremely dangerous Keter-Class anomalies. Security protocols and countermeasures in this zone are maintained by the technical research staff of Sector-B. Personnel assigned to this area consists of highly-trained agents and researchers with appropriate clearance codes assigned to their specified anomalies. Sector-C's power supply is separate from that of Site-98 and runs on it's own generator with a backup in the event of human error or attacks from hostile Groups-of-Interest.

Due to the threats posed by much of the contained entities and objects within, Sector-C is located underground with the only portion of the sector remaining above ground being the site's maintenance elevator; which serves as the only entry and exit point accessible to Sector-C. Sector-C3 is another isolated section of the sector that functions as a containment unit for Thaumiel-Class anomalies. Only selected researchers and high-ranking agents are permitted with special clearance to work under Sector-C3.

------
Unlike the rest of its sister sites, Site-98's operations can be mostly found above ground working on the latest developments and breakthroughs in Hume counter and reality anchor stabilization technology. Site-98 is the leading research facility responsible for the various bleeding-edge technological advancements in anomalous containment.

Established in March of 1959 by Dr. Bellford as a provisional site around SCP-1287, Site-98 would later on expand its operations across the United States; setting up a secondary site under the same designation in Ohio underneath SCP-4156. This would eventually culminate with Dr. Gallmund, the second director of the site, announcing a new and permanent location for Site-98 with the other sites functioning as sister facilities within the city of Philadelphia.

Site-98 has had many of its directors come and go from Bellford, Gallmund, Davis, O'Marrin, to its current director; Harvey Henshaw. Each of which have brought changes to the site or influenced it to bring about significant changes in its directive. Site-98 has also had the least amount of containment breaches than any other site, despite much of the research being done involving crosstesting between other anomalies and the constant experimentation.

++ E-Class Staffing Information
[[/=]]
While many individuals bring a variety of their own skills and talents to the Foundation, others afflicted by various anomalous phenomena bring far more than the average Foundation agent or researcher. Site-98 is particularly well-known for its Class E personnel.
@@ @@
[[collapsible show="Open Personnel File: GRAIL" hide="- Close File"]]

+++++ Dr. Leah Grail
> Specializing in both Classical and Relativistic Mechanics, Dr. Grail was transformed by SCP-████ when it transferred its anomalous properties to her. This resulted in the death of SCP-████, Neutralizing it completely.
>
> Just like SCP-████, Dr. Grail has inherited its properties of superhuman speed, a personal extraphysics field for manipulation, and the ability to process information at a rate consistent, if not superior, with that of an exascale supercomputer operating at peak performance. Dr. Grail has mostly used her anomalous nature to further development of various research projects and manage other divisions of her own.
>
> Dr. Grail's cognitive performance has been monumentally invaluable to Site-98 so much so, that the Foundation's Research Committee, of which she is considered for a seat, has nominated her as chairwoman.

[[collapsible show="Open Personnel File: WILLIAMS" hide="- Close File"]]

+++++ Agent Phoebe Williams
> Originally functioning as a tactical and combat assault operative, Agent Williams was exposed to an experimental protoreal ideatic device that conceptually converted her into a living idea.
>
> As an abstract concept, Williams has lost all physical form but instead exists within sapient ideascape subspace with the core components that remain in her manifesting primarily as the ideals for the Foundation's core purpose in its existence; all while possessing the qualities and aspects of her original personality which can only be described as "snarky" and "hot-headed".
>
> Agent Williams is currently operating as a combat instructor for combat assault trainees within the Foundation's Combat and Assault Division.

[[collapsible show="Open Personnel File: BARTON TWINS" hide="- Close File"]]

+++++ Drs. Clyde and Clancy Barton
> The twin sons of the late Chester Barton, Clyde and Clancy Barton are researchers specializing in Ontokinetics, the brothers have made numerous breakthroughs in the study of reality benders; specifically how to contain them effectively and efficiently.
>
> As for their status as Class E, both brothers were affected by a Class-C "Broken Entry" Wormhole during a test run of a prototype reality anchor that was supposedly based off of the same schematics of a Lang-Scranton Stabilizer with the additional application of newer technologies integrated in its design. This incident, has brought both doctors to be trapped within the confines of a non-dimensional plane for approximately 65 hours before being brought back to baseline reality via a safety measure implemented in the reality anchor prototype in case an event similar to the [[[SCP-3001|"Scranton Incident"]]] were to occur again.
>
> Both brothers have been permanently redshifted and possess a passive effect on local reality: Both are capable of generating an "Anti-Reality Field" around themselves that steadily grows its field at a rate of 8.17% per second. To counter this, each wear a Reality Stabilizer Harness[[footnote]]Currently in its prototype phase, the RSH is often considered as a "wearable reality anchor" by the average layman. Both Clyde and Clancy Barton are the first individuals to have worn such a device.[[/footnote]] or RSH, to hinder the ever-decreasing drop in their internal Hume value. Both twins are currently researching ways to cure their affliction as well as aid the further development of reality bender technology.

[[collapsible show="Open Personnel File: DENSON" hide="- Close File"]]

+++++ Researcher Carter Denson
> Researcher Denson is was afflicted with an infohazardous memetic anomaly that constantly referred to him and all actions related to him in the past tense. This was shown to affect all known forms of communication such as spoken and written languages. Other alternative means of communication such as sign language and morse code are the only known ways to properly bypass the infohazard that affected him.
>
> It is unknown as to how or why this anomaly emerged on Researcher Denson as he has yet to be involved in any known experiments or projects. Researcher Denson was currently operating for technical archival work in Sector-B's sub-level basements.

[[collapsible show="Open Personnel File: PHOENIX" hide="- Close File"]]

+++++ Dr. Alice Phoenix
> Emerging from an alternate Foundation's reality where [[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/bird|nearly everyone is/acts like a bird]]], Dr. Alice Phoenix serves as the director of containment for Site-98 and also happens to be a Great Egret. Her experience with avian anomalies and innate knowledge of the more [[[SCP-3570|absurd K-Class Scenarios]]] lend her the experience needed to analyze anomalous events which propelled her up the Foundation's promotion ladder.
>
> Dr. Phoenix found herself materialized onto our reality after a multiversal translocation experiment went wrong; the D-Class involved in the test was lost to whatever reality she originated from and in return, Dr. Phoenix took their place here in our universe.
