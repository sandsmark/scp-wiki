title:Intelligence Operative "Drewbear"'s Personnel File
**Name:** ██████ ███████

**Alias:** "Drewbear"

**Assignment:** Information trawling; identification of references to initial super-, sub-, and para-normal incidents in the public sphere; verification of anomalies located in [REDACTED] region of North America.

//Further information regarding "Drewbear"'s history or current analysis projects are pending declassification. See I.O. Chief S██████ if immediate access is required.//

Note: DNA testing performed at the time of hire revealed that I.O. Agent "Drewbear" was genetically identical to the Level 3 Researcher A█████ B███████, who was assigned to Site 17 at that point. More extensive background checks and biometric analysis eventually revealed that neither individual represented an anomaly worthy of Foundation attention. Rather, they were 2 of 3 identical triplets anonymously adopted shortly after birth. Their both being hired by the Foundation is considered a coincidence. The identity and location of the third triplet is unknown at this time.
