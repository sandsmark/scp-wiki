**Item #:** SCP-4488

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** Provisional Site-4488 has been established around the area of SCP-4488. Roads leading towards Provisional Site-4488 have been shut down and redirected. Biohazard signs have been placed within the vicinity so as to deter intruders. A perimeter fence has been erected within a 3km radius of Provisional Site-4488 and is to be monitored by on-site security personnel. A construction team is to be kept on-site to expand the perimeter of  Provisional Site 4488 to accommodate further drilling efforts if the need arises. In the event of a containment breach, the perpetrator(s) are to be promptly apprehended, administered Class-A amnestics, and then released. 

**Description:** SCP-4488 is a small lake located in a heavily wooded forest near ████████, Montana. At surface level, SCP-4488 appears to be an ordinary lake with no observable anomalous effects. However, at a depth of approximately 20m, a 12m thick layer of small rocks, salt crystals and sand are present. Past this cloud is a seemingly infinite area of saltwater, hereafter referred to as SCP-4488-1. So far, no landforms have been observed within SCP-4488-1, and its exact dimensions are unknown. SCP-4488-1 is completely devoid of light and once inside, there are no currently known ways of exiting SCP-4488. 

The only known method of entering SCP-4488-1 is by diving directly into SCP-4488, although further testing is still being conducted (//See Addendum 4488-1//). SCP-4488 first came to the Foundation's attention after various records of unusual geological measurements of SCP-4488's depth were discovered. Numerous missing persons reports in local towns relating to individuals going camping and never returning further piqued Foundation interest. Local agents were promptly dispatched to conduct more tests on SCP-4488 in order to gain information on its exact nature. 

**Addendum 4488-1:** Attempts are currently being made to drill into SCP-4488-1 through surrounding mountains, which have so far proven to be unsuccessful. All attempts to drill under SCP-4488 result in the discovery of basalt, a mineral not commonly found in the region, directly under SCP-4488. Attempts to drill further down under SCP-4488 are currently underway.

**Addendum 4488-2:** On 12/11/20██, An exploration mission was performed into SCP-4488.

> 
> **Mission Goal:** Gather further information on SCP-4488-1, such as a finite size and possible inhabitants.

> **Researcher ███████:** Ok, you may now proceed down the lake.
> 
> **D-4488-3:** 'Kay one question, why the fuck are we in a submarine on a lake?
> 
> **D-4488-2:** It's probably a ghost lake or something.
> 
> **D-4488-1:** Shut up you two. 
> 
> **D-4488-2:** Are you afraid of the ghost lake?
> 
> **D-4488-1:** No, I'm afraid you won't shut the fuck up any time soon.

> **D-4488-1:** I swear if you finish that god damn sentence.
> 
> **Researcher ███████:** D-4488-7, where do you see this fish? Nothing is appearing on your body camera.
> 
> **D-4488-7:** Outside of this window, just kinda swimming around, looks like a trout. 
> 
> **Researcher ███████:** (//Switches to exterior cameras.//) I do not see anything around your ship. 
> 
> **D-4488-5:** Well I'm pretty sure we all see a fish, it's swimming away now though. 
> 
> **D-4488-7:** Well there goes the most interesting thing to happen here so far. 
> 
> **D-4488-6:** Where there's one fish, there are two fishes. 
> 
> **D-4488-2:** What Dr. Seuss over here said. Probably more ghost fishes swimming around somewhere in here. 
> 
> **Researcher ███████:** Continue descending.

> **D-4488-5:**  Wait, is that a jellyfish?
> 
> **D-4488-7:** (//Moves towards D-4488-5.//) What uh, yeah it is, and a really big one. Do you see that thing doc?
> 
> **Researcher ███████:** Nothing is visible on any cameras. Make an attempt to capture this organism. 
> 
> **D-4488-2:** You heard the nerd, fire the cannons!
> 
> **D-4488-1:** I'm making my way towards the jellyfish now. 
> 
> (//The team travels straight for a minute, and then moves in circles.//)
> 
> **D-4488-1:** Circling the jellyfish, does this thing have torpedoes or anything? No wait I found them.

> 
> **D-4488-5:** Hit! 
> 
> **D-4488-1:** We hit the jellyfish thing. 
> 
> **Researcher ███████:** Does it appear to you that you hit this jellyfish? 
> 
> **D-4488-7:** Uh, yeah. 
> 
> **Researcher ███████:** The torpedo has not hit anything from my view. 
> 
> **D-4488-5:** Well for us we just blew up a jellyfish. Can we like open an airlock and try to get the body in?
> 
> **D-4488-1:** That I can do.  
> 
> (//Rear airlock is opened, D-4488-1 proceeds to maneuver the vessel in an attempt to place the seemingly nonexistent jellyfish inside.//) 
> 
> **D-4488-1:** Is it in there? 
> 
> **Researcher ███████:** Dive team, I have come to the conclusion that you are under the influence of a mind altering hazard. Note that this anomaly does not seem to possess any harmful effects so far, so you must continue moving. 
> 
> **D-4488-1:** Ok then? So is anything that we are seeing here real? 
> 
> **Researcher ███████:** From what I've seen, these organisms you are seeing are not really there. 
> 
> **D-4488-1:** You hear that boys? Looks like we don't need this jellyfish then, I'm clearing the airlock no-
> 
> **D-4488-2:** Oh shit!
> 
> **D-4488-1:** Oh, uh, there seems to be some sort of big eel circling our sub. It's got these uh, big sharp teeth and spikes all over it, But, uh, it's not real right? Not real at all?
> 
> **Researcher ███████:** I do not see any sort of creature.
> 
> **D-4488-1:** Oh, good. Well now it's glowing blue and wrapping closer around us, are you sure it's not real? 
> 
> **Researcher ███████:** I assure you tha-
> 
> (//All team members cover their ears and react in terror for unknown reasons. D-4488-1 quickly descends the vessel down for five minutes while yelling obscenities.//)
> 
> **D-4488-1:** Yeah, no. Fuck you, that was real. I don't know what kinda joke you are playing, but it's not funny!
> 
> (//All team members cover their ears once again, with D-4488-1 rapidly careening the vessel downwards for more than 10 minutes. Team members begin to scream as a land formation is seen for a split second before the vessel collides with it, causing extreme damage to the vessel and presumably terminating the entire team.//

Looks like a simple feat, you made it to the bottom of the unknown, making it known. But the truth of it is, you will never know all the things that lurk in the dark, you will merely scream in the light for the answers you wish for, even though the answers you want aren't the part of life you should focus your finite time on.

> [[span style="font-family:times new roman;"]][[size 125%]]You should revel in the mystery, the wonder, the fear, of what could be out there in deep ocean waiting to help, waiting to destroy, waiting to do something entirely new. You know this is the truth, yet still question with logic the deepest depths and what they have to offer, instead of fearfully wondering what might be under that golden shore. I show what could be there, not what is, and you still logically question, instead of simply wondering what else could be there. Come to me and wonder, come to me and truly think.
