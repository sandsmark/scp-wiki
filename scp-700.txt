**Object Class:** --Euclid-- Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** As SCP-700 is immobile, one security teams are to be permanently placed at the site, to avoid the entrance of civilians and unauthorized personnel. --They must be equipped with breath masks at all times when inside of SCP-700.--

--SCP-700-1 is to be covered with a ██ m long metal slab. The slab can only be removed if all personnel present inside SCP-700 are wearing full-body, non-organic biohazard suits and breath masks, and only for the purpose of running necessary tests.-- Following Incident 700-1, this part of the containment procedure is no longer necessary. See Incident Log 700-1 for more details.

**Description:** SCP-700 is a large, abandoned building, similar to a factory in design, located on the rural area of ██████████, USA. It contains █ floors (one being underground), each containing exactly ██ rooms. Many of these rooms are built in a way that does not appear to serve to any specific purpose, containing redundant machinery, sewage pipes that are not connected to any kind of disposal unit, and numerous power cords extended across the room in a manner similar to sash cords.

███ graffiti pictures (designated SCP-700-2) can be observed inside SCP-700 rooms. They usually depict humanoid figures, altough some animal-like creatures were also noticed.

All instances of SCP-700-2 have been observed to show the capacity to move around the walls of their rooms. Their frequency of movement varies depending on what room SCP-700-2 is located. For example, rooms blocked with iron bars will make SCP-700-2 mostly immobile, with only slight movements being made at seemingly random periods of time. It is currently unknown if the graffiti are sentient, but as their movement patterns are erratic, and considering that all attempts at communicating with them have failed, it is currently assumed that they are not.

Inside the central room of the underground floor is SCP-700-1.

SCP-700-1 is a circular hole, 10 meters deep and with a radius of 1.5 m. Attached to the walls of the hole are an approximately ████ 0.3 ml plastic syringes. At the bottom of the hole is a small 1 x 1 m grate, leading into an unlit chamber. Removing the syringes from the wall is possible. New syringes will "grow" to replace the lost ones few moments after their removal.

The syringes at the bottom of SCP-700-1 are constantly producing a yellow liquid, composed primarily of human urine, sweat, [DATA EXPUNGED]cluding menses. This mixture produces a fragrance deemed "very attractive" to all humans that come in contact with it. If SCP-700-1 is left uncovered, the smell will spread through all the rooms of the building.

Upon smelling this fragrance for a small period of time (usually █ minutes), subjects will begin to unconsciously move towards SCP-700-1. If not stopped, they will throw themselves down SCP-700-1. The fall will usually result in fractured bones, but all observed subjects were unaware of the fact, concentrating only in consuming the liquid dropped by the syringes.

After a human falls inside SCP-700-1, all syringes will be filled with fluorosulfuric acid. The lower ones will extend their needles until they make contact with the subject, at which point they will inject their contents inside it. The upper syringes will continuously eject their contents over the subject. This process will continue until the subject is dead, after which the remaining fluids will flown towards SCP-700-1 grate.

█ hours after the death of the subject, a new graffiti picture will be found in one of SCP-700 rooms. It will behave like all other instances of SCP-700-2.

SCP-700 came to the attention of the Foundation after various reports of a man called "Mr. ██████" selling "living art" on concrete blocks. When confronted by Foundation personnel, Mr. ██████ attempted to flee, and injured one agent before killing himself when it became clear he could not escape. The location of the building was found at his home. The Foudnation was able to find and destroy ██ of the blocks that Mr. ██████ sold. The owners of the blocks were given Class B Amnesiacs.

**Addendum 700-1**: Staff working inside SCP-700 have reported sightings of a featureless humanoid figure silently walking inside SCP-700 rooms after a human died inside SCP-700-1. This entity (designated SCP-700-3) disappears when researchers try to make physical contact with it, and it does not respond when communication is attempted. Thus far, SCP-700-3 has proved to be harmless. Any changes in SCP-700-3 behavior are to be reported immediately.

**Addendum 700-2**: Recently, █ researchers and ██ D-Class personnel that observed pictures of SCP-700-2 claimed to have momentarily seen the graffiti in some of them moving. Further tests have confirmed that SCP-700-2 depicted in photographs will appear to move only to subjects with a previous history of [DATA EXPUNGED]. What causes this event is currently unknown.

**Incident Log 700-1**: On █/██/████, Dr. █████ brought four D-Class personnel to SCP-700 with the intention of removing a sample of SCP-700-1 walls. As D-9462 struck the walls with a hammer, a loud shriek could be heard coming from all rooms of the building. SCP-700-1 then disappeared, taking D-9462 with it. SCP-700-1 was replaced by solid concrete, and, as of ██/██/████, did not re-appear. Manifestations of SCP-700-3 have also stopped occurring. As a result, SCP-700 was re-classified as "Safe".
