[REPORT IN PROGRESS]

**Item #:** SCP-260

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-260 is to be kept inside a locked room at all times. No less than two (2) armed guards are to be stationed outside the room 24 hours a day. Each use of SCP-260 must be pre-scheduled with one of the Level 4 personnel, along with a detailed description of intended experiments. 

Usage of SCP-260 is to take place in the secure Firing Range. All personnel to use SCP-260 must be subjected to psychological evaluation before. 

**Description:** SCP-260 appears at first glance to be a typical, foldable, electric-powered wheelchair, with two handles on the back. It is operated with a joystick, no differently from other wheelchairs of this type; however, the electric motor apparently does not require batteries of any kind to work, and it is unknown where it gets the energy necessary to function. 

An even more remarkable quality becomes apparent after the passenger presses a small button, located on the left footrest. When this is done, the handles seem to "open up", and several long, mechanical implements emerge from within. While emerging, they expand in thickness and length, with more and more elements become visible on their surface; their sides also open up, with more "branches" emerging from them, too. Within 10 seconds, all the devices are fully deployed; by that time, the wheelchair resembles an impressive arsenal, with the handles branching into a collection of cannons and turrets. It is unknown how all this machinery fits inside the handles when not deployed; research suggests that this might be done with the use of extradimensional pockets, a technology obviously beyond anything possible to produce today. 

The following weaponry is contained within SCP-260: 
* Six (6) miniguns. 
* Two (2) missile launchers. 
* Two (2) flamethrowers. 
* Three (3) lasers of enough power to [DATA EXPUNGED]. 
* One (1) small cannon firing an unknown type of radiation. This radiation does not seem to affect any living organisms or non-living materials in any way, harmful or otherwise. Dr. ██████ has suggested that this may be, in fact, a means of defense against some unknown being or hazard, vulnerable to this weapon. 
* Additionally, a large lamp suspended directly above the back seat of SCP-260, capable of illumination of ███,000 cd, up to a range of 800 feet. 

A small panel emerges from within the left footrest,
