title:Scp 260
Item #: SCP-260

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

SCP-260 is kept in a locked metal box buried five meters under the ground.   It must be periodically reburied every three days.

Description:

SCP-260 appears to be a small smooth stone.  SCP-260 nearly always has a name written in red on it.  It will attempt to kill that person.  It can only kill victims when they are asleep, as it is far too slow to fight, and then by boring itself into the victim.  Its movements are unnoticeable, but over the course of several weeks it can potentially move several miles.  Personell who it has targeted see SCP-260 as being red, but most personell see it as being grey.  When it is targetless, it will target the first person who touches it.   Dr. ███ Laugher, its current target, has reccomended it for termination.
