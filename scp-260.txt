**Item #:** SCP-260

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:**

SCP-260 is kept in a locked metal box buried five meters under the ground.   It must be periodically reburied every three days.

**Description:**

SCP-260 appears to be a small smooth stone.  SCP-260 nearly always has red etchings on Surface B that state its current target's name.  It will attempt to kill that person.  It can only kill its target when they are asleep, as it is far too slow to fight.  SCP-260 kills by using its movement to bore into the sleeping's neck or heart.  Its movements are unnoticeable even if they are actively touching or harming the observer (as initial tests proved), but over the course of several weeks it can potentially move several miles.  Experiments on ██/██/██ show that SCP-260 can burrow straight through any object.  Even SCPs known to be indestructible seemed to yield to its effects when it was in the way of its target, although they self-repaired nearly as soon as it exited the other side.  Personell who it has targeted see SCP-260 as being red, but most personell see it as being grey.  When it is targetless, it will target the first person who touches it.   Dr. ███ Laugher, its current target, has reccomended it for termination, as was predicted.
