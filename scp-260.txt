**Item #:** SCP-260

**Object Class:** Euclid (Possibly Neutralized)

**Special Containment Procedures:**
SCP-260's current location is to be tracked by Foundation Personnel, who must also keep constant track of its current target. To maintain the safety of the current target (who is of importance to the Foundation), said individual must be in constant movement to assure that SCP-260 does not catch up with him. It is recommended that said target not be relocated more than one thousand kilometers at a time, to avoid complications that could be caused by SCP-260 traveling through the Earth's inner layers.

**Description:**
SCP-260 appears to be a small smooth stone, dark red in color, with the name of its currently assigned target inscribed upon it. SCP-260 constantly moves in a direct line towards its target at a rate of approximately 1 cm per second: as of this current date, no outside force has been able to prevent this movement. In addition, SCP-260 appears to be virtually indestructable, and has survived gunfire, a hydraulic press, immersion in concentrated acid, and passage through the Earth's core. Because of the inexorable nature of the force applied, SCP-260 will eventually burrow through any and all material that remains in its path for any significant amount of time, including human flesh and bone.

SCP-260 kills by slowly burrowing through its target's flesh and penetrating the heart, causing death by shock, blood loss, trauma, and cardiac arrest. Upon killing its current target, the stone will change color to white and become inert for a short length of time (between one and twenty four hours) before turning choosing a new target and resuming its normal state. It is currently unknown whether SCP-260 is itself sentient, or whether an outside party gives it orders by unknown means.  However, its new target is always one of the closer people to the object.  It never yet has selected a target more than 50 miles from where it killed the former target, and this distance decreases with increases in population density.

**Addendum:**
After SCP-260 killed Dr. Laugher, it targeted a civilian, henceforth to be referred to as Subject One.  Subject One was [REDACTED].  SCP-260 has not been relocated, but search efforts are on to congratulate it on it's valiant efforts to improve the Foundation.
