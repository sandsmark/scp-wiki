in the beginning
there was nothing
a pinprick of nothing
or perhaps a pinprick is too large
and within it was contained the entirety of everything
the entirety of nothingness
and all was calm
and nothing happened
until
something did
And there was an explosion of light
Of matter
Cascading
Infinitely fighting against the nothingness
Creating
Expanding
Forever
Patterns emerged
Great spheres of gas, mass -- showers of glass, the growing of grass
Suns
Planets
Black holes
but also
Life
Sentience
Sapience
and
to the best of our knowledge
People

All was beautiful
All was gorgeous
All was
Unimaginable
And unimaginably
Large
and people were so
unimaginably

small

...

But the nothingness was powerful
And it had existed a long time before the somethingness
And it was angry about being replaced
Or perhaps intruded upon
It swore, it swore
That it would return the somethingness to the nothingness
It just needed time and entropy
And all would collapse back into the endless black
Because all things fall to ruin in time

...

and it does
the universe
it dies
from nothing, something
from something, to nothing

...

...

...

in the beginning
there was nothing
a pinprick of nothing
or perhaps a pinprick is too large
and within it was contained the entirety of everything
the entirety of nothingness
and all was calm
and nothing happened
until
something did
And there was an explosion of light
That flooded your eyes
Because you were born

And in your eyes you held the world
You held the spark of life
From nothingness, you came
The somethingness
And you cried
Because you had never been something before
And this was so wildly different

You learned to walk
You learned to speak
You learned to greet each day with curiosity
And wonder
And
Perhaps
Love

But more importantly
You broke the nothing
And everywhere you looked
You found
Somethings
And you began to comprehend
Your mind made conjectures wherever it looked
Fighting against the nothingness
Creating
Expanding
Forever
Patterns emerged
Flowers blossomed
Each and every one of them a figment of your realization
And where you walked
The world followed
And where you stepped
A step was awaiting
And where you laughed
The world heard it
And it continued this way
And it did so for infinity

...

But the nothingness was powerful
And it had existed a long time before you did
And it was sad for being interrupted
Its nirvana broken by chaos
It wished, it wished
That it would return the somethingness to the nothingness
There just needed to be time and entropy
And all would collapse back into the endless black
Because all things fall to peace in time

...

and it will
your conscience
it will die
from nothing, something
from something, to nothing

and it will scare you
and it will seem impenetrable
inescapable
and it is

and you will return
from nothing, your something
your something, to nothing

...

...

...

But
In the beginning
There was nothing
A pinprick of nothing
Or perhaps a pinprick is too small
And within it was contained the //entirety// of //everything//
And //everything// was //nothing//
And from the nothing, came //everything//

The stars
The planets
An explosion of light
Of matter
Cascading
Infinitely embracing the nothingness
Creating
Expanding
//Forever//
And in it, there were patterns
Patterns too small to notice
And patterns too big to take in
But patterns
Patterns that were before you were
Patterns that will be after you're gone
Patterns that span beyond the confines of the nothingness and the somethingness
Patterns that build and build
Despite the nothingness
No
Because of it
And they are large
And they are beautiful
And they are gorgeous
And unimaginable
And
Unimaginably
Consistent

...

from the nothing, came something
to the nothing, the something will return
from the nothing, came you
to the nothing, you will have to go

but from the nothing, came something
and who is to say
that it wouldn't
come
again
