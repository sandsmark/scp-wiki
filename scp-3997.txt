**Item #:** SCP-3997

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** All SCP-3997-1 instances are to be taken into Foundation custody, and interviewed to acquire information on SCP-3997, before being issued with Class-C amnestics and returned to the population. 

A special taskforce, MTF ██-██ "Ragged Claws" is responsible for the location and detention of these individuals. This taskforce has undertaken extensive antimemetic and cognitohazardous training, in an effort to [DATA EXPUNGED].

**Description:** SCP-3997 is a mental phenomenon affecting a number of individuals, hereafter referred to as SCP-3997-1 instances. It has been determined that the only common factor linking SCP-3997-1 instances is having lived in or visited the United Kingdom at some point in their early childhood, specifically between the ages of 2 and 5. An abnormally large number of these instances were residents of the county of ███████████████, England, and the surrounding area.

SCP-3997-1 instances report a number of vivid dreams featuring white roses. These dreams often involve memories of early childhood, but which have been altered to feature white roses or walking through a rose garden. SCP-3997-1 instances demonstrate an inordinate fondness for white roses, sometimes bordering on the obsessive.

SCP-3997 was first brought to the Foundation's attention as a result of the regular psyche evaluations of several researchers from the West of England, which revealed that they shared extremely similar recurring dreams, despite a lack of contact or involvement with one another beforehand. 

Below is an interview with a typical SCP-3997-1 instance: Dr. █████ ███ ████, a Level 3 Foundation researcher.

> 
> **Dr. O██████:** Hey, H████.
> 
> **SCP-3997-1-A:** That's SCP-3997-1-A to you, sonny. //<Laughs>//. I thought Frank was interviewing me?
> 
> **Dr. O██████:** Nah, he'll be along later today. I wouldn't worry about it. So, when did you first start getting these dreams?
> 
> **SCP-3997-1-A:** When I was about four, I think. I kept dreaming I was a delivery guy. For mechanical parts of some kind. It's a bit weird, really- not the kind of thing a four-year-old normally dreams of. Anyway, I'd keep dreaming about white roses in pretty much all my dreams, no matter what they were about. Houses would be made of them, clouds would look like them, that sort of thing.
> 
> **Dr. O██████:** Was there any particular... feeling, or emotion, that you associated with the roses? Just something the others have said.
> 
> **SCP-3997-1-A:** ...Yeah, actually. They've always reminded me of my childhood, and my home back in M██████. Whenever I see them, I keep thinking of... old memories. Little things, you know- like going to church, or lying on the grass, or swimming down near W█████. It's weird, really- nothing else has that kind of effect on me. They just... make me feel nostalgic.
> 
> **Dr. O██████:** Why is that weird? It's not that strange to have memories and feelings triggered by things from your childhood.
> 
> **SCP-3997-1-A:** Yeah, but, that's the thing- apart from those dreams, I never really had any contact with white roses. Mum didn't grow them in the garden, we never had them in a vase... they just bring back memories. Make me feel... innocent, I guess. I don't know why it is.
> 
> **Dr. O██████:** What are your feelings towards white roses in general? Outside of your dreams?
> 
> **SCP-3997-1-A:** Well, as you know- I like them. I've painted a few, down at my house in █████, and I like growing them. They're just pretty flowers, though.

**Item #:** SCP-3997

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** All SCP-3997-1 instances are to be immediately and permenantly  taken into Foundation custody on discovery, and interrogated for knowledge pertaining to SCP-3997. A special taskforce, MTF Mu-45 "Ragged Claws", has been established for the purposes of --both-- detaining SCP-3997-1 instances --and locating SCP-3997--; this taskforce has undertaken extensive antimemetic and cognitohazardous training, in an effort to counteract the presumed effects of SCP-3997.

**Description:** SCP-3997 refers to a rose garden, believed to exist somewhere in the British county of Gloucestershire. SCP-3997's existence has thus far only been inferred from the testimony of SCP-3997-1 instances and from Incident-3997-1, and as a result its existence is only a theory.

From what has been gathered from the aforementioned testimony, SCP-3997 appears to be an ordinary rose-garden, containing a series of interlocking pathways surrounded by pergolas and intersecting flowebeds. White roses are grown on the pergolas and in the flowerbeds. It is believed that, should any adult individual enter SCP-3997, a significant temporal shift will occur. This involves the individual's memories being transferred into the consciousness of that individual at an earlier point in time- ordinarily between the ages of 2 and 5. These memories appear to the child in the form of a particularly vivid dream, followed by several similar dreams for 5-8 years following this. Individuals affected in this manner are referred to as SCP-3997-1 instances. These individuals are unaware that these dreams are anomalous.

The prescence of these memories in the consciousness of SCP-3997-1 instances appears to have a dramatic effect on the course of their life, often influencing them to take entirely different decisions and manifest a notably different personality than in the previous timeline. SCP-3997 instances are thus usually- though not exclusively- high successful in both their personal and professional lives, often becoming experts in their chosen fields. In addition to this, SCP-3997-1 instances suffer vivid dreams throughout their life featuring SCP-3997, white roses and several childhood memories. Speaking about these dreams often causes SCP-3997-1 instances to enter a kind of trance-state, where they are able to recall aspects of these dreams in great detail.

Activation of SCP-3997 thus causes a subtle but significant CK-class restructing event, which is believed to have occurred innumerable times. --The location and termination of SCP-3997 is now a top priority-- All efforts to locate SCP-3997 have been ordered to cease immediately, on the orders of O5-1. Because of this, and the temptation among many personnel to seek out SCP-3997 for their own use, full knowledge of SCP-3997 has been restricted to the O5 council and selected personnel involved with research on SCP-3997.

SCP-3997 was first brought to the Foundation's attention as a result of the regular psyche evaluations of several researchers from the West of England, which revealed that they shared extremely similar recurring dreams, despite a lack of contact or involvement with one another beforehand. 

The extremely similar descriptions of SCP-3997 from SCP-3997-1 instances have prompted a belief that the rose garden was a real place. This belief has strengthened following the events of Incident 3997-1, wherein [DATA REDACTED ON ORDER OF O5-1; SEE BELOW FOR FURTHER DETAILS].

Below is an interview with an SCP-3997-1 instance, SCP-3997-1-A. This instance was formerly Dr. Henry St. John, a level 3 Foundation researcher, before his anomalous status caused him to be stripped of his rank and placed in containment.

> **Interviewed:** SCP-3997-1-A.
> 
> **Interviewer:** Dr. Kartesian.
> 
> **Foreword:** This interview was conducted 02/09/1997, in a standard humanoid containment cell in Site 226.
> 
> **//<Begin Log>//**
> 
> **Dr. Kartesian:** Good afternoon, SCP-3997-1-A. Are you finding your quarters comfortable?
> 
> **SCP-3997-1-A:** Frank, you've known me for seven years. I've been a researcher for thirty. I know the drill. Let's get on with this.
> 
> **Dr. Kartesian:** ...Very well. What can you tell me about the rose garden?
> 
> **SCP-3997-1-A:** The- what? What rose garden?
> 
> **Dr. Kartesian:** If our suspicions are correct, you should have had a dream about a rose garden. Several dreams, in fact. Since you were a small child.
> 
> **SCP-3997-1-A:** You want to know about the //garden//? Well, OK... I suppose I have dreamt about it quite a lot. It's just a recurring dream. There's nothing suspicious in it.
> 
> **Dr. Kartesian:** That's for us to decide. Now, tell me about these dreams. 
> 
> **SCP-3997-1-A:** O-kay... well, they always start with me as someone else. I'm not a linguist at all, I'm a truck driver. I drive trucks. Or was it a van? Something like that. I've always disliked them- too big, smelly, that kinda thing- but I really hate them in this dream. Resent them, that sort of thing. Anyway, in the dream, I'm doing a delivery to this big country house.
> 
> **Dr. Kartesian:** A- do you remember anything about this house? A name? Location?
> 
> **SCP-3997-1-A:** I'm afraid not. I remember some kind of classical-looking facade, but... nothing else. Is that important?
> 
> **Dr. Kartesian:** I'll ask the questions, thank you.
> 
> **SCP-3997-1-A:** For God's sake, Frank...
> 
> **Dr. Kartesian:** What happened? Did you enter the house?
> 
> **SCP-3997-1-A:** No. I knocked on the door, but nobody was home. I waited around for a bit, but there wasn't anything there. So I... I'm sorry, Frank, it's hard to remember. It's a dream, they're not easy to remember... so, I see this hedge. Got an entrance in it. I go in, and I'm in a rose garden. Lots of white roses everywhere. They're arranged over archways, over wooden frames. Little neat stone paths, stretching, stretching away in front of me... so white, so pure...
> 
> //At this point, SCP-3997-1-A seems to have entered a kind of trance state.//
> 
> **SCP-3997-1-A:** And I walk through it, and I look at the sky... it's a fine sky... the grass looks like it's glowing, 'cause the sun's shining down and it's all so calm, peaceful, serene... nobody else is around. There's just me, and the roses...
> 
> **Dr. Kartesian:** SCP-3997-1-A? SCP-3997-1-A, are you alright? ...Henry? Can you hear me?
> 
> **SCP-3997-1-A:** And then… all of it fell away, in a single instant. The roses were all around me, and it all felt… right. Like when I was a child, and they knew what was right and what was wrong again, and the warmth of my mother’s arms. I remembered… I remembered things, images, little things you wouldn’t remember… summertime as we walked the path to church, looking at the old gravestones and thinking of their age, looking at the sky and its distant clouds, the way they played against the sky. They weren’t abstract balls of steam and water, they were, were… they were an anchor of infinity to earth, and a solid, real reminder of infinity. I looked at the gravestones, and thought of how beautiful this place was, this England. It was a place where they could truly be at peace, under the sun and in the green and yellow fields, rolling on down the hills. The world was beyond the horizon. Here was paradise.
> 
> **Dr. Kartesian:** …And what else?
> 
> **SCP-3997-1-A:** What else? I remember…. I remembered running in the playground. I remembered watching the news about the Suez Crisis and not understanding what it meant, or why my mother seemed so serious so suddenly. I remember rainy days reading old books, nestled in a corner by the radiator. I remember films about New York, how strange the city seemed with its cabs and its grey buildings teetering on the edge of the same bright sky I saw in the graveyard. I remembered my childhood as a whole thing, all the little things that seemed normal and unimportant then, but seemed so visceral now, so real. And I remembered the roses.
> 
> **Dr. Kartesian:** What about them?
> 
> **SCP-3997-1-A:** The roses... the roses in the garden. They were there, too, as I walked through it. They were my mother’s arms, they were the warmth of summer, they were sitting in a brightly-lit train as it tunnelled through a dark thunderstorm… they were memories, all the memories of the place I belonged to, really belonged to, before it all fell apart and stopped making sense. I was real again. I was me again. I went back to my home, my England, and then, and then- and then I woke up.

> Sorry, Frank. Was a bit out of it, there. What were we talking about?

> **Note from O5-1**
> 
> I think, under the circumstances, we can dispense with the usual incident log for this thing. I'll try to be brief.
> 
> You're probably wondering why we're so sure that SCP-3997 is an actual, physical rose garden. After all, couldn't it just be a memetic dream? Snippets from some parallel universe that have infected our minds? There are any number of theories about it that are equally, if not more, plausible. So why are we putting so much time and effort into looking for it?
> 
> The answer is that you might well be right. It could indeed just be an idea or a dream. The world might not have been remade a dozen times over. For a while now, it's just been a working theory, one that accords with the facts and explains the absence of obvious memetic and antimemetic markers in the SCP-3997-1 instances. But now that I'm in this new position, there's a little story I want to tell you, to explain why we- why I- have classified it in this way.
> 
> Shortly after being granted Level 4 clearance, I was made the project lead on SCP-3997. I was part of the Counterconceptual Division, but my background was with temporal anomalies. Don't ask me how that happened; the usual bureaucratic reshuffling, spreading around of expertise, etc. I don't remember much of my time there. Anyway, there aren't a great many temporal antimemes, and since they suspected that this might be something similar, I was pretty much the only person qualified for the job.
> 
> At first I thought they were right; it seemed memetic. Hell, I even theorised that it was a weak antimeme that kept deleting knowledge of its own origin. Nobody could find this rose garden, so I decided that we should try a different tack. I was planning on updating the file and reclassifying it to safe. Maybe they'd give me something juicier than a bunch of people obsessed with flowers.
> 
> Then one day, something odd happened. I was giving a briefing to the Ragged Claws- which I hoped would be one of my last- when I asked for a fairly new agent, Iggy Carmichael, to give a report about the expedition he'd been on last week. Some other agent- Wilson, I think- said that Carmichael was on leave. He was swimming off the coast of Spain, in the glorious summer sun. We looked at each other for a second, and then at the rest of the room- they were staring at us, confused.
> 
> After a moment, I suddenly remembered that there was no Agent Carmichael. I'd got his name wrong- it was Agent Cornwallis who was meant to give me the report. I initially assumed it was just the usual sleep-deprivation, but something gnawed at me. Wilson had remembered him too. And he'd said that he was a good swimmer- that had seemed to ring true. Awakened some memory in me. But how could something like that feel familiar? Carmichael didn't exist.
> 
> An ordinary person would think it was just a weird coincidence. But Foundation researchers are cursed with paranoid minds, so I looked into it. I'd thought that Carmichael's name had been something long and ridiculous- he was the scion of a local noble, after all. Started looking up locals with his surname. And, lo and behold, I found a match. One Ignatius Cornelius Carmichael- not exactly a common name. He was an Olympic swimmer, and had got the bronze just last year. The son of a minor landowning notable.
> 
> It wasn't hard to piece together after that. You see, CK-class restructing events are rarely neat and smooth. Nor are temporal anomalies. Time only seems like a linear progression to us mere mortals; change something at one point, and the whole dimension restructures in an instant. Sometimes, things get left behind. You only need to look at the dozens of inconsistencies the bunker has caused to see that. Ignatius Carmichael had once been Agent Carmichael. He'd been part of the Ragged Claws, and he'd found SCP-3997. It probably wasn't even that hard to find.
> 
> He went into the rose garden. And everything changed. He had a few dreams, a few scattered memories about the life he'd left behind, but what mattered was that he was young again. He had his whole life ahead of him. No failures, no retreat. He'd always been a strong swimmer, but now he could achieve the dream he'd always wanted to achieve- he knew what to do, how to do it. He didn't have to die in the dark with us, when he could live in the light like the rest of them.
> 
> When we hauled him in for questioning, we went to his house- his manor, I should say. I was there. I strode up the path with the rest of them, knocked on his door, helped take him away with official-sounding names and warrants. But where there should have been grass, where there should have been a lawn, fountains, other things rich toffs litter their grounds with, there were only roses. Thousands and thousands of roses. Carmichael said that he didn't want there to be anything else. He didn't care for any other plants but roses. He couldn't. He claimed to have planted every one himself.
> 
> The implications became suddenly, horrifyingly clear. There //is// a rose garden. Somewhere in Gloucestershire, there's a rose garden, sitting in the grounds of an ancient country house. It's probably not that hard to find. We could probably do it in a few instants. In fact, I think I can say with some certainty that we have- time and time and time again. We don't know how it works- maybe it's just knowledge of its location that sets it off. Maybe we really have been fool enough to send someone in there. We don't know. But it's out there, and we must have sent dozens, hundreds, maybe thousands of personnel to restructure the universe. There are so many of them in the Foundation, after all. An infinity of realities being replaced and stripped away. Billions upon billions of lives no longer lived, children no longer born, all because of those endless white roses.
> 
> I'm an O5 now. I'm glad I've been promoted. It means I'm less close to all of this. I'm ordering that we stop trying to find the rose garden immediately. Containment efforts are now going to be all about stopping people from going there. I don't know how we'll do that, short of flooding all of Gloucestershire. I don't know what to do. All I know is that we have failed absolutely. We've caused the world to die an indefinite number of times. The Foundation has failed. All we can do is hang our heads in shame, and try to pick up the pieces.
> 
> Oh, and one more thing. I'm sure that many of you are now feeling tempted to use SCP-3997 yourself. The temptation is always there and is always great. I have lain awake myself at night, thinking of all my regrets, all the things I have done wrong. For the price of a few bad dreams, I can make all my sins go away, and be new again.
> 
> Don't try it. You'll be destroying people, stopping them from ever being born, stopping them from know what life was. And beyond that- the comfort the garden offers is unreal. It's a withdrawal from the truth. We all want to go back to when things were warm, and simple, and the days were filled with the summer sun and cool grass. We all want to live in the light again. But we all made our choices, and we all swore our oathes. Every one of us will die in the dark. Accept that.
