//The following partial documentation pertaining to object of special interest "FLY AGARIC" has been procured by agent [REDACTED] of which there is little doubt. Work into ascertaining the authenticity of recovered files is ongoing; the anomalies described within have been given the provisional classification numbers E-501 and E-502 with sources local to the territory of Mordovian ASSR tasked to ascertain the existence of E-501.//

> {{**DETAIL:** OSI "FLY AGARIC" is the designation of a subspecies of //Fomes fomentarius//, provisionally designated //Fomes fomentarius copiosus//. The appearance, habitat and nutrition of //F. fomentarius copiosus// resembles that of its superspecies, and sample combustion analysis shows no differences in composition.}}
>
> {{//F. fomentarius copiosus// has been designated object of special interest due to abnormal traits associated with the growth and physical properties of its fruit body.}}
>
> {{The mycelium of //F. fomentarius copiosus// does not appear to penetrate significantly into the host, with very limited saprotrophic activity; the characteristic areas of decomposing wood demarcated by pseudosclerotic layers are all but absent. Long-term studies of specimens on host wood segments in a sealed chamber have shown that there is net mass gain as the specimens' fruit bodies grow and mature; this suggests the specimen obtains nutrients from elsewhere.}}
>
> {{In addition, the fruit body of //F. fomentarius copiosus//  exhibits atomism. An attempt to remove a section thereof results in no change to the volume or mass of the fruit body, however, a segment identical to that of a similarly cut control sample of //F. fomentarius// is produced, independant of the direction of the cut. This property is not preserved in the removed segment. Setting fire to a fruit body causes it to combust until extinguished, while spontaneously increasing in mass and volume at a rate of cca. 20g/hour, with ash and fragments detaching. No spontaneous upper limit was observed as of now, with longest experiment running for three (3) months and achieving a combined debris mass of ~40kg}}
> {{See Appendix A for data on occurence. The species appears endemic to forests in the Mordovian ASSR.}}

> {{ Proposed uses:}}
> {{@@       (i) Cheap supply of fuel@@ - REJECTED. High water content and resistance of fruit bodies to dessication; segments can be processed as normal but limited economic value due to labour requirements.}}
> {{@@       (ii) Felt production@@ - APPROVED - cheap and expedient material collection. Comrade I. Kalugin commended; by estimate, could help to exceed felt production targets by 135%. Test run of felt to be produced and thoroughly tested by  01. I. 1967.}}

Dispatched fire brigade found the premises to contain extensive amounts (app. 2000 cu. m.) of unknown matter, which apparently caused structural damage resulting in short-circuit of feed leads leading to fire. Embedded GRU-P agent "KOLYA" was alerted, and requested ARC from local command. Procured unburnt samples were shown to be the remains of tissues of //Fomus fomentarius// fruit bodies. Investigation pending.}}

> {{**IVF:** If this is why... I didn't do anything! I was in the pub the evening, just ask Sergej, Misha or Leonid. And then went home, my wife can- }}
> {{**R:** Calm down, comrade. We haven't accused you of anything. And I'll be frank with you, we don't suspect the factory staff - there's a few ideas out there as to how the accident came about, and all I'm here to do is to clear up a couple details. So, let's get this over with, eh? }}
> {{**IVF:** Alright.}}
> {{**R:** Excellent. Now, your documents say 'operator' but that's a wide term. What exactly is it that you do here? }}
> {{**IVF:** I'm... I run the cutter.}}
> {{**R:** What cutter? Tell me in detail.}}
> {{**IVF:** Well, it's the cutter. You stuff in a trunk, it gets cut into planks, they get bathed, shaped,  then out to dry. I'm the one who keeps it fed and cutting at the right rate and all that. }}
> {{**R:** Bathed?}}
> {{**IVF:** Yeah. It's some stuff that prevents the wood from going foul. Impregnation, that's the fancy name for it. See, we're first class, our planks go for floors and cupboards and all that. Furniture. }}
> {{**R:** Alright. Now, for the classic. Did you notice anything unusual during the last shift?}}
> {{**IVF:** Not really. It all went swimmingly, given the crap they trucked to us. I swear, comrade, they want us to plait a whip from shit, when you look at the targets and material. }}
> {{**R:** Who does?}}
> {{**IVF:** Everyone. But this is the lumber folks' fault. Half the trunks they sent us were obviously trushy, all hiding under the nice ones. The shit is supposed to go for firewood. So when we- uh. }}
> {{**R:** Go on. }}
> {{**IVF:** Well...}}
> {{**R:** Listen, I won't pull this out from you like threads from a felt blanket. I'll assume you didn't bother to reject the crap they sent you, or notify your boss. I don't care - we're not workplace malpractice committee. Now, carry on and cut the crap. }}
> {{**IVF:** Yeah, you got it. See, if we did anything it'd fuck up with our factory trying to get awards for exceeding targets - and our bonuses would go to hell. So we cut it anyways and hoped nobody will notice the discoloration anytime soon, or if they do, they'll keep hush about it. After all, it's not our fault - they can go cry at the suppliers. }}
> {{**R:** I suppose.}}
> {{**IVF:** But, this is where it gets interesting! A couple of us were kinda nervous about it, and went to inspect the planks coming out - see there's a couple things you can do to make such damage a bit less obvious. But, the wood came out fine. I wouldn't have believed by looking at the bark, but the trush hasn't eaten through at all, no lines good colour, good hardness, all! So on paper it was all fine - nobody could blame us for pushing forwards wood that looks alright by the spec.}}
> {{**R:** I see. Anything else you noticed? }}
> {{**IVF:** Not really. I was happy enough how we put one over the fuckers, then went to have a couple drinks to celebrate after the shift... and after in the morning, I heard there was a fire overnight. }}
> {{**R:** Thank you comrade, that will be all. I might show up again for you to sign a statement, but, until then.}}

> {{**DETAIL**: Since its discovery, further work was carried out on //Fomus fomentarius copiosus// specimens, motivated by the incident described in document 32-II-1966. The main experimental results follow:
> The use of a systemic fungicide on //Fomus fomentarius copiosus// specimen exhibiting atomism results in the reification of copious amounts of dead //F. fomentarius copiosus// tissues. The tissue reifies in a timescale corresponding to the absorbtion of such a fungicide and the manifestation of its effects, as confirmed by testing control group //F. fomentarius// specimens.}}
>
> {{The amount of reified tissue has been found to be a function of the live mass of the fruit body prior to application. Experimentation with small fruit bodies has revealed the following empirical relationship assuming fungicide saturation: m,,r,, = e^^m/K^^, where m,,r,, is the reified mass, m the original mass of the fruit body and K = 6.046 grams; valid for fruit bodies above ~5g.}}
>
> {{Attempting to repeatedly section such bodies have shown the same limit to apply to the anomalous pseudo-atomist behaviour (termed //fomoid atomism// further on) discovered earlier - after being sectioned  457 times, the cca. 50g experimental sample ceased to reify fungal matter.}}
>
> {{Coupled with known information regarding the mycelium of //F. fomentarius copiosus//, the prevalent hypothesis at the time is that the tissues of a //F. fomentarius copiosus// grow out in a spatial direction perpendicular to the unit vectors of 3-space, with dead or removed tissue being detached and forced into the local point by mass of surrounding matter, which manifests as it reifying. These findings are consistent with 4-space theory proposed by academician G. Chutayev. The focus of current research is to examine the pressure of tissue reification as means of verifying stated hypothesis - if valid, the pressure curve should show linear decrease with amount of tissue reified.}}

Especially in securing terrain, and intruder detection, tracking and detention, the guard dog has been an indispensable accessory; however, resilience is often an issue. }}

If successful, the project will open the way forwards for widening the scope of use of "CERBERUS"-type watchdog in the context of military and civil security operation, as well as explore the effects of inducing fomoid atomism in higher organisms.}}
