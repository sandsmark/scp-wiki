**Item #:** SCP-1424

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1424 is to be placed in an airtight, 2 x 2 x 2 m cushion lined containment pen. The area is to be monitored biweekly to confirm the subjects physical condition. Personnel are to equip gas masks when entering the area. The containment cell is to be filtered for gas daily.

**Description:** SCP-1424 appears to be and adolescent dog of the Alaskan malamute breed.  A platinum chain choke collar around it's neck reads "Patches, for my Sweetheart". Behavior of SCP-1424 is typical of adolescent dogs.

SCP-1424 has a bodily temperature that ranges between -23 to -18 °C and extrudes trace amounts of ammonia through its tongue and paws continually, causing a significant health risk to personnel exposed in an unventilated space for a long enough period of time. How this compound is produced from SCP-1424 is not yet known. 

SCP-1424 also displays a number of other physical abnormalities:

* SCP-1424 shows no vital signs.  Bodily organs are intact although non-functioning. 

* SCP-1424 does not react to what would normally cause an organism physical pain.

* SCP-1424s body does not heal from injury. 

* SCP-1424 has not been shown to respond to sound, light, or smell, although its motor and vocal ability do not appear to be inhibited.  

* SCP-1424s eyes do not appear to functional, as it has been seen colliding with walls occasionally when moving around its containment pen. 

* It cannot be ascertained whether or not SCP-1424 sleeps or is simply not moving. 

SCP-1424 moves around its containment pen in a predictable pattern each day, only deviating from this repeated behavior when interrupted. When placed into a different cell, SCP-1424 will simply repeat the pattern of movement that was exhibited on its first day present in its new surroundings.

Special precautions are to be taken when moving and testing SCP-1424 for preservation purposes. 

SCP-1424 was discovered at a pound in Los Angeles, California following multiple failed euthanasia attempts. Witnesses were administered amnesiacs and the SCP was recovered without incident. Staff at the pound report the owner being extremely distressed when delivering SCP-1424 to their facility, placing SCP-1424 on the counter and immediately leaving. No additional information on the previous owner was found.

**Autopsy Report 1424-A:** 

Special precautions were taken during extraction of the contents of the stomach and intestine  to prevent unnecessary physical damage to SCP-1424. As expected SCP-1424 did not react with distress and shows no signs of inhibited movement or vocal ability after the procedure. Contents of stomach were identified to be an undigested steak, paper material, and one (1) 2.42 CT diamond encrusted ring set in 14k white gold.
