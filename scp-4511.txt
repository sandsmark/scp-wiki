**Special Containment Procedures:** The factory SCP-4511 resides in has been purchased by the Foundation and designated Provisional Site-4511. MTF Pi-1 ("City Slickers") have been assigned to manage containment and security of the object. All organic matter which has exited SCP-4511 is to be returned inside, regardless if living or deceased.

**FILESERV NOTICE:** AS OF WRITING, RESEARCH INTO SCP-4511 IS STILL ONGOING. SOME ERRORS MAY BE PRESENT.

**Description:** SCP-4511 is a large mechanical construct located in the basement of Danforth Meatpacking, a disused meatpacking factory in Chicago, USA. SCP-4511 externally resembles a domestic pig[[footnote]]//Sus scrofa domesticus//.[[/footnote]], measuring approximately 15m by 25m by 20m at its widest points, and is constructed of iron, which has become heavily oxidized following several years of improper maintenance. SCP-4511's primary entrance point is a large blast furnace in a constant state of activation, despite being disconnected from all fuel lines and ignition sources.

SCP-4511's left flank contains a thin 5cm-long slit that, upon certain conditions being met, will print an index card carrying a series of instructions.

**Recovery Report:**
> The ██████████ factory was initially raided by Foundation agents embedded within the Chicago Police Department in response to reports of occult activity in the area. They encountered heavy resistance from a group of occult worshipers who had taken residence in the basement. MTF Epsilon-9 ("Fire Eaters") were dispatched to lend support to the Chicago Police Department. Of the forty-seven cultists that had previously inhabited the factory, only one survived their injuries for more than seventy-two hours. While the individual was treated for their injuries, Foundation personnel began studying SCP-4511. The following card was discovered left within SCP-4511.

> Every twelve hours, SCP-4511 produced another copy of the card. On 01-24-65, the last surviving victim of the raid on the factory was pronounced deceased. At the same time, SCP-4511 produced a new punch card.

**MTF Body Camera Video Log Transcript**

**Date:** 05-13-65

**Task Force:** MTF Epsilon-11 ("Nine-Tailed Fox")

**Subject:** Provisional Site-4511

**Team Lead:** ε-1

**Team Members:** ε-2, ε-3, ε-4
-----

= **<<BEGIN LOG>>**

**ε-1:** Safeties off. Sound off on my count. One.

**ε-2:** Two.

**ε-3:** Three.

**ε-4:** Four.

//Team enters the factory single-file, guns raised.//

**ε-1:** No sign of research team on the main production floor. Descending into basement.

**Command:** Proceed with caution.

//Team crosses the factory floor to the freight elevator, and enter.//

**ε-1:** Three, time to earn your keep.

**ε-3:** Yessir.

//ε-3 moves to the electrical box of the elevator and attempts to pull it open. After a few seconds of pulling, he succeeds in opening the cover. The interior of the fuse box is revealed to have been sealed to the door with a layer of waxy material.//

**ε-4:** Is that... fat?

**ε-3:** Ugh.

**ε-2:** Probably from years of disuse. I don't think anyone was cleaning it even when this place was still open. Three, can you get it working or do we have to throw ourselves down, lemmings-style?

**ε-3:** Yeah, I should be able to rig something up real quick. Gimme a second.

//ε-3 spends several minutes interacting with the fuse box. With a lurch, the elevator begins slowly dropping.//

**ε-1:** Well done. Unless they somehow moved the thing, SCP-4511 should be somewhere on this floor.

**Command:** Weapons free, though we'd prefer if at least a couple were brought in alive.

**ε-1:** Roger th-

//The elevator reaches a stop and the overhead lights shut off.//

**ε-2:** Three, was that you?

**ε-3:** I didn't touch the lighting fuses. That's something else.

**ε-1:** Doesn't matter. Four, get over here and help me open these doors.

//ε-1 and ε-4 work together to open the cargo doors of the elevator. The entire lighting system for the lower floor is shut off.//

**ε-1:** Flashlights on, they're creeping about here somewhere.

//Team advances onto the catwalk and continue in silence for 2 minutes, until ε-2 pauses.//

**ε-2:** Jesus fuck Three, did you piss yourself?

**ε-3:** What? No!

**ε-1:** We're walking in it.

//ε-1 gestures to the catwalk floor, and the shallow puddle of yellow liquid covering it.//

**ε-4:** Fuck me, I think I'm going to vomit...

**ε-3:** God, that's... who the fuck //does// that?

//The team is interrupted by a drop splashing into the puddle. They raise their weapons and flashlights to reveal a fleshy growth attached to the ceiling, a hole from which is leaking the urine.//

**ε-1:** (quietly) Keep moving. One of you guys, make sure you're looking at it.

//The team continues forward, ε-4 bringing up the rear to keep a view on the growth. They continue in silence for another 4 minutes, descending a stairwell.//

**ε-1:** We're reaching the basement floor.

**Command:** [Unintelligible]

**ε-1:** You're cutting off. Repeat, we're reaching the basement floor. Sound off. One.

**ε-2:** Two.

**ε-3:** Three.

//Silence.//

**ε-1:** Where the fuck is Four?

**ε-3:** I... she was just next to me!

**ε-2:** Do we go back to look for her?

**ε-1:** Yeah. Get ready.

//The team retreats up three flights of stairs. ε-4 is splayed out on a landing, unconscious.//

**ε-1:** Two!

**ε-2:** On it!

//ε-2 begins applying first aid to ε-4, who has a large wound in her right thigh. ε-4 slowly regains consciousness.//

**ε-4:** I don't know what happened. One minute I was behind you guys... and the next, I'm clutching my head here.

**ε-1:** Active hostile entity in the area. Possibly anti-memetic. Can you walk?

**ε-4:** N-no.

**ε-1:** Take your gun and shoot anything that isn't us. We'll be back. I swear.

//The team returns down the stairwell, reaching the bottom and spreading out. The floor is largely covered in various furnaces.//

**ε-2:** There's something up ahead.

//The entrance to SCP-4511 is visible at the end of the room. A large pile sits next to it. Upon closer view, the pile is comprised of several white-coated bodies, all suffering from extreme exsanguination. A figure sits on the floor next to the pile.//

**ε-1:** Hands up, now!

//The figure stands up, wearing the uniform of a researcher. A large burn scar stretches across his right cheek. He is clutching something in his right hand.//
 
**ε-1:** Whatever's in your hand, drop it.

**Unknown Individual:** Whatever you think you can do to me, it's nothing. Nothing compared to what //it// can do.

**ε-2:** What's "it"?

//The individual gestures behind him, seemingly at SCP-4511 and the pile of corpses.//

**Unknown Individual:** I took their oil to feed //it// and I'll take yours too...

**ε-2:** I'm giving you five seconds to sit the fuck down before I blow your brains out.

**Unknown Individual:** //You can't win!// If you kill me, //it// wins. And you'll never let //it// win, because you've had it so drilled into you that //it// is wron-

//ε-2 terminates the individual with a single shot to the head. A rumbling sounds emanates from SCP-4511. ε-3 advances and inspects what the individual was holding: A small clump of bloody flesh and a scrap of paper.//

**ε-3:** "Meat from those who seek to do in my faithful."

//ε-3 picks up the piece of flesh, and throws it into SCP-4511. The flames roar.//

**ε-1:** What the fuck? Why did you do that?!

**ε-3:** I don't know.

**ε-2:** Come on. We have to go get Four. She won't last long as she is.

//The team reascends the main stairwell, to the location Four was sitting in. Four is unmoving, her gun beside her.//

**ε-2:** FUCK!

**ε-1:** Check for a pulse!

//ε-2 shakes his head.//

**ε-2:** Nothing.

**ε-3:** Christ. One, what do we do?

//ε-1 sighs.//

**ε-1:** Only thing we can do. Head back up. We terminated the threat, and Director Calebs is outside with an emergency ResCon[[footnote]] Combined Research/Containment team. [[/footnote]] team.

**ε-2:** Let's go, then. We need backup to clean this place out.

**Document 4511.1:**
> Due to unforeseen circumstances, the current containment and research team for SCP-4511 are no longer in a position to do their duties. Until further notice, I will be removing myself from the Regional Director position in order to take the position of Lead Researcher on the SCP-4511 project. This anomaly is more dangerous than we originally gave it credit for, and it led to the deaths of twenty-four people. I refuse to let that happen again.

**Incident 4511.2:** Two hours following Incident 4511.1, SCP-4511 produced a punch card before ceasing all activity. In-depth examination of SCP-4511 revealed no remains of any subjects or alternative fuel sources that could have been used for the flames.
