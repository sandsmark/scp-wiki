**Item #:** SCP-2455

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2455 is to be stored in a standard humanoid containment cell. This cell will be monitored at all times by a camera connected to an image analysis program. If at any time an instance of SCP-2455-1 is detected, Site Security is to be notified immediately. 

If the SCP-2455-1 instance is identified as Foundation personnel, SCP-2455 is to be administered a low-grade amnestic after the manifestation ceases to insure no classified information is retained by SCP-2455. In this event, Internal Affairs are also to be notified.

If the SCP-2455-1 instance is a member of a Group of Interest, or under the affects of another SCP, Containment Breach alarms are to be sounded immediately.[[footnote]]Not because SCP-2455 is expected to breach containment, but because the SCP-2455-1 instance indicates a real possibility that 2455 will come into contact with a GoI or SCP in the imminent future.[[/footnote]]

**Description:** SCP-2455 is a Caucasian woman of 21 years of age. The subject exhibits no anomalous properties outside of a SCP-2455-1 manifestation event. SCP-2455 is noted by staff as 'indecisive' to the point where the subject is apathetic towards its own containment.

SCP-2455-1 instances appear identical to SCP-2455 with one visible factor altered, the majority of which has been its clothing. Most commonly they will be wearing the uniform of an organization with which SCP-2455 is not affiliated. These instances will be in possession of all knowledge SCP-2455 has, in addition to all knowledge of their affiliated situation (a SCP-2455-1 instance in a baker's uniform, for example, will possess professional knowledge of baking). SCP-2455-1 will manifest in the nearest space that could contain them.

SCP-2455 claims that SCP-2455-1 manifests when it is faced with a 'major decision'. See test logs attached below for analysis on this claim. SCP-2455-1 instances appear with the sole intention of insuring SCP-2455 'picks their future'. SCP-2455 claims the first appearance of SCP-2455-1 occurred shortly before its graduation from ████████ University, as SCP-2455 was attempting to choose which business to apply for employment with. Two instances of SCP-2455-1 manifested, one 'representing' the █████ Corporation, and the other the ██████ store, a local business. Both instances possessed knowledge of the working conditions of both positions,[[footnote]]This knowledge has been verified as accurate[[/footnote]] and attempted to convince SCP-2455 to 'pick them'.

__**Test 001 - 04/██/20██**__
> **Procedure:** Subject is offered a different colored uniform.
> **Results:** No SCP-2455-1 manifestation.
> **Analysis:** Trivial decisions do not appear to trigger SCP-2455's effects.

__**Test 002 - 04/██/20██**__
> **Procedure:** Subject is asked if it wished to be moved to a different site.
> **Results:** No SCP-2455-1 manifestation.
> **Analysis:** From SCP-2455's point of view, the two situations were identical.

__**Test 003 - 04/██/20██**__
> **Procedure:** Subject is offered employment with the Foundation.
> **Results:** No SCP-2455-1 manifestation.
> **Analysis:** Subject was visibly conflicted by this decision, however no manifestation event occurred.

//I wonder if SCP-2455's effects could tell that we were not genuine with our offer?// - Dr Vauge.

__**Test 034 - 06/██/20██**__
> **Procedure:** Unplanned test. As no test conducted so far had resulted in a manifestation event, the research staff were considering doing final tests and declaring SCP-2455 non-anomalous.
> **Results:** SCP-2455-1 manifested wearing casual street clothes. Upon manifestation, SCP-2455-1 attempted to hide from research staff. When discovered, SCP-2455-1 vanished immediately.
> **Analysis:** In the time period between SCP-2455-1 manifesting and its discovery, there was a real chance that SCP-2455 would be administered amnestics and released back into society. This indicates three things: first, that it does not have to be SCP-2455's decision that affects it's future, that there has to be a real chance of that future occurring, and that SCP-2455-1 manifestations are not necessarily conductive to that future.


__**Test 036 - 07/██/20██**__
> **Procedure:** Dr ████ (currently under watch from Internal Affairs for known sympathies to humanoid anomalies) was asked to interview SCP-2455.
> **Results:** SCP-2455-1 manifested wearing the uniform of a junior researcher, and attempts to convince Dr ████ to employ SCP-2455, citing the precedents of [REDACTED]. SCP-2455-1 ignored SCP-2455.
> **Analysis:** This manifestation was aware of classified information, notably the anomalous natures of [REDACTED]. Further questioning revealed that SCP-2455-1 was in possession of knowledge which would be expected of a Foundation employee with level 2 clearance.

__**Test 041 - 31/██/20██**__
> **Procedure:** Unplanned test. SCP-2455 was being moved to another facility.
> **Results:** SCP-2455-1 manifested wearing the same clothing as SCP-2455, however was infected with SCP-███
> **Analysis:** The infected manifestation attempted to attack SCP-2455 to infect it with SCP-███. The escorting guards were able to neutralize the instance as they would a normal SCP-███ victim. Shortly afterwards, a containment breach occurred at Site-██, during which samples of SCP-███ were released. Possibility of using SCP-2455 as an 'early warning' system is deemed worthy of further research.

> **Interviewed:** An SCP-2455-1 instance identical to the one produced by test 036. 
> 
> **Interviewer:** Dr ████ (Necessary to cause this instance of SCP-2455-1 to manifest)
> 
> **Foreword:** SCP-2455-1 had been taken to another room so that SCP-2455 would not be involved.

> 
> **Dr ████:** I beg your pardon?
> 
> **SCP-2455-1:** The way I am now my future is either with the Foundation or locked up by the Foundation. I don't want to be locked up, but //no//, ██████ wants to be a baker...
> 
> **Dr ████:** If I may ask, what exactly is your relation to SCP-2455?
