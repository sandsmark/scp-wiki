title:Dr Gears Storytime Entries
+ Introduction

In many ways, I question my entry here.  To even attempt to put myself in the same realm of Black Fedora and Josef K seems like a terrible sacrilege.  Still, I have been told that my little chat stories have merit as creepypasta, so in the spirit of greater entertainment, I now post them here for your enjoyment.

Occasionally, I get ambitions and write something above and beyond short creepypasta.  Here are stories that slip over in to the "short story" realm.  Longer, but I hope still worth the price of admission.
