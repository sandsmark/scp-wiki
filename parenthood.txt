We found out yesterday that Maddie's pregnant, and we've already started turning the guest room into a baby room! Good thing I got a pay raise last week. We gotta think of the baby now!}}

Jesus, waiting for the doctors to deliver her felt like years. Now, as I'm typing this, she's downstairs, fast asleep in Maddie's arms. We named her Abby, and she's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. I'll send pictures soon.}}

It actually pays pretty well, and you know she loves kids. No child could every replace Abby in her heart, of course. Speaking of which, Abby's first birthday was yesterday! Howard and Rachael even showed up! Got to see their niece for the first time! Too bad you and dad are all the way down in Florida. We'll have to visit when Abby's older. Love you!}}

We started feeling it after Abby's injury at the playground. We've had the doctors look her over, but as far as they're concerned, no permanent damage, physical or mental, came of Abby's injury. But I just know there's something wrong with her.}}

It doesn't make any sense, he says, but he says that when he was around her he couldn't shake the feeling of wrongness. The staff who were working with him agreed, apparently. He says that he didn't tell us at first because he didn't want Maddie and I to worry, but that he just couldn't keep quiet anymore.}}

Like I'd rather be anywhere else but next to my own daughter. I try and limit my interaction with her as much as I possibly can. It's terrible, but being around her, it makes me wanna throw up. It's inside of her. In her eyes, in her skin, everything about her.}}

**Recovery Log:** SCP-053 was recovered on July 10th, 2008, in ██████, Pennsylvania, from the residence of Andrew and Madeline ███████. Local authorities discovered SCP-053 and the deceased bodies of the couple within the same room. Mrs. ███████ had expired from multiple stab wounds produced by Mr. ███████, who had expired from a massive heart attack shortly afterwords, believed to have been caused by SCP-053's anomalous effects. Police who attempted interaction with SCP-053 also suffered from its effects, resulting in 5 additional casualties before implanted Foundation agents assessed the situation and properly secured the subject. Class-A amnesiacs were administered to all non-personnel involved, including Mr. ███████'s parents in Florida, as they had been exposed to information regarding SCP-053 through communication with Mr. ███████.
