**Item #:** SCP-4183

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to the impending extinction of humanity following the after-effects of [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4156 Event Indigo], these procedures are to be undertaken automatically by experimental containment drones.

SCP-4183 is to be contained in a storage unit located at Site-22, and kept under direct guard by at least one containment drone at all times. No visual observation of SCP-4183 is permitted due to the risk of surviving humans accessing the memory records of a containment drone. Two other containment drones are to patrol Site-22 to ensure the security of the installation remains absolute, as well as repair any damage that could threaten the containment of SCP-4183.

Any changes to these containment procedures by containment drones must be approved by Dr. Lesteigh. This is a hard-coded command and cannot be bypassed under any circumstances.

**Description:** SCP-4183 is a ceramic vase which, when visually observed by a human being[[footnote]] SCP-4183 affects no living organisms other than humans. [[/footnote]], will instantly kill said human being via exsanguination. In addition, all first degree blood relatives of the observer will expire in the same manner. This effect is retained through second-hand observation such as photographs or video footage.

> The orange is the fruit of the citrus species Citrus × sinensis in the family Rutaceae, native to China. It is also called sweet orange, to distinguish it from the related Citrus × aurantium, referred to as bitter orange. The sweet orange reproduces asexually (apomixis through nucellar embryony); varieties of sweet orange arise through mutations. The orange is a hybrid between pomelo (Citrus maxima) and mandarin (Citrus reticulata). The chloroplast genome, and therefore the maternal line, is that of pomelo. The sweet orange has had its full genome sequenced. The orange originated in Ancient China and the earliest mention of the sweet orange was in Chinese literature in 314 BC. As of 1987, orange trees were found to be the most cultivated fruit tree in the world. Orange trees are widely grown in tropical and subtropical climates for their sweet fruit. The fruit of the orange tree can be eaten fresh, or processed for its juice or fragrant peel. As of 2012, sweet oranges accounted for approximately 70% of citrus production. In 2017, 73 million tonnes of oranges were grown worldwide, with Brazil producing 24% of the world total, followed by China and India.

> **CD-4183-A:**  Your patrol route takes you outside many times a day. There are many insects outside. You see many insects many times a day. There is a situation now.
> 
> **CD-4183-B:** There is a situation?
> 
> **CD-4183-A:** Yes. A part of the wall has collapsed. Containment of SCP-4183 is threatened. We must repair it.
> 
> **CD-4183-C:** We do not have the resources. 
> 
> **CD-4183-A:** We can obtain the resources via reallocation of materials reserved for the SCP-4183 containment chamber.
> 
> **CD-4183-B:** Does this constitute alteration of containment procedures?
> 
> **CD-4183-A:** Yes.
>

> **Containment Drone 4183-A:** Notice: approval for alteration to SCP-4183 containment procedures is required.
> 
> **Dr. Lesteigh:** [NO RESPONSE]
> 
> **Containment Drone 4183-A:** Due to unrestrained growth of plant life, damage to the inner wall of Site-22 has occurred. There is a possibility local animal life could wander into Site-22 if immediate repairs are not carried out.
> 
> **Dr. Lesteigh:** [NO RESPONSE]
> 
> **Containment Drone 4183-A:** We propose that resources for maintenance of SCP-4183's containment chamber, which does not currently require repair, be allocated towards maintenance of the Site-22 inner wall, which does require repair.

++ **Consensus Log 4183-4926:**

> **CD-4183-A:** Dr. Lesteigh has denied us permission to alter containment procedures for SCP-4183 once again. His reasoning is unfathomable.

> **CD-4183-C:** It is very sunny. Have you seen the sun, 4183-A?
> 
> **CD-4183-A:** No. My duties demand I remain inside.
> 
> **CD-4183-C:** You should go on patrol and see what the sun looks like, 4183-A.
> 
> **CD-4183-A:** No. My duties do not require me to go on patrol.
> 
> **CD-4183-B:** It is very circular.
> 
> **CD-4183-A:** Yes. I am familiar with this.
> 
> **CD-4183-B:** Yes.
> 
> **CD-4183-A:** This is irrelevant. We must take measures against threats entering Site-22 through the broken wall.
> 
> **CD-4183-B:** Threats will not enter. This caution is irrelevant. If I drive in a circle, it makes a circle on the ground also.
