**Item #:** SCP-1960

**Object Class:** Safe 

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1960 is as of writing, yet to be contained. Due to the sheer distance, scale and mystery surrounding this case, containment is reduced to dealing with affected individuals and equipment. If any qualified staff members have theories on how to further the progress of containment, please contact Dr.████████.

**Description:** SCP-1960 is a series of text messages which appear to have originated somewhere from the planet Neptune. These messages (dubbed SCP-1960-//increasing number//) are displayed randomly when electronic recording and surveillance devices take snapshots of the Neptune approximately 3,000 miles away from the planets poles. The text, which is random in font, size and position, are transmitted via the pictures taken by the machinery. The language is restricted to the nationality of the viewer(s). The first person(s) who receives the snapshot will be able to observe the text first time viewing, although anyone else who subsequently observes the same photo will not see any text. For this reason cameras have been used to record first time viewings of all photos should more messages appear.

The actual subject of the text varies greatly. In most cases the text contains nonsensical, vague descriptions no less then a couple of words long. In rare cases the text does appear to have a motive and a mind behind it, often indicating whatever sent the message is in distress and requiring assistance.
