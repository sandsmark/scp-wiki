-----

**Item:** SCP-4000

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Foundation influence is being utilized to socially engineer the artistic preference for interrupted, angular geometries in architecture so as to minimize the size of SCP-4000 instances. Comparative influences are being propagated in the use of mosaics and arabesques upon pre-existing structures. Agents embedded into localized urban subcultures are to covertly generate graffiti upon offending advertisements on-sight, per Operation Banksy.

Events that coordinate the aggregation of uniformly-colored clothing or signage are to be stymied by planted agents or by other means of civil disruption.

**Description:** SCP-4000 is the designation for a group of advertisements that spontaneously manifest in spaces previously unutilized for commercial marketing. Potential habitats for SCP-4000 include both physical and digital negative spaces. The advertisements house potent visual and/or auditory memetic agents that disproportionately increase the desirability of the featured product or company. 

Instances can be either static or dynamic, and most often appear in areas where the possibility of exposure is relatively high (e.g. highly-urban environments or websites with significant traffic). Physical mediums typically involve building materials, but instances have been observed on the superficial layers of biological tissues, such as the skin and other organs.[[footnote]]A recent autopsy revealed instances of SCP-4000 colonizing the inner surface of an individual’s cornea, suggesting the individual either consciously registered the adverts constantly, or experienced subconscious memetic effects from their being hidden in his periphery.[[/footnote]] Investigation regarding the origin and dissemination of SCP-4000 persists. 

Manifestation occurs via ill-understood means over the course of approximately 30 seconds to twelve minutes, irrespective of size or location. Adverts can appear on parchment that is attached to surfaces[[footnote]]Such instances are uniformly coated with an unidentified laminate-like composite.[[/footnote]] or be directly upon surfaces by means of paint, ink, etchings, or unexplained pigmentation of the native material. SCP-4000 occupies digital spaces by incorporating itself into the source code and can adopt a multitude of known and unknown languages.

Attempts to efface the advertisements have been met with unexpected difficulties; physical instantiations are either indelible or anomalously affixed to the affected structure while digital ones do not respond to editing the code. SCP-4000 instances can be removed from physical surfaces either by applying concealment such as paint or by demolishing the structure entirely. Both are considered temporary, as recurrence rates are high and there are currently no known means to prevent SCP-4000's ongoing annexation of negative spaces.

Companies linked to the appearances of SCP-4000 instances consistently deny placing or contracting the advertisements. Despite a recognizable motive for such companies, no tangible evidence has yet to be established in a court of law.[[footnote]]Property owners regularly file cases against the implicated companies, manufactures, corporations, and/or third-party marketing agencies.[[/footnote]] The Foundation has inserted auditory and visual memetic components within the presentations of involved judicial practitioners to discourage the consideration that the etiology of the advertisements may be preternatural. The majority of cases resolve without official litigation, the most likely explanation considered to be the work of highly-skilled stencil-graffiti artists.

[[tab List of Notable Instances]]

> **Instance:**  6
> **Location:** Taj Mahal - Agra, India
> **Size:** 39m x 39m 
> **Notes:** An advert for a Japanese car manufacturer, etched into the structure by unknown means. The mausoleum has been coated with memetic nanotechnology to make the advert virtually undetectable and will need to be demolished for definite removal.[[footnote]]A cover story about damage from pollution is underway as of 7/12/18.[[/footnote]]

> **Instance:** 8 
> **Location:** www.██████.com[[footnote]]A high-traffic Chinese shopping website.[[/footnote]] 
> **Size:** 200p x 250p 
> **Notes:** An advert for consolidated financial solutions. Embedded code identified as XHTML. Attempts to remove are unsuccessful. Site's services not interrupted due to projected financial loss, advert remains.[[footnote]]The company has seen a 304% increase in revenue.[[/footnote]]

> **Instance:** 9 
> **Location:** Target Import Warehouse - Savannah, Georgia, USA
> **Size:** 27 square acres 
> **Notes:** An advert for Wal-Mart. Was painted and appeared on the roof, which is the most identifiable structure from an aerial perspective in the region. Was painted over with significant cost and labor. 

> **Instance:** 14 
> **Location:** PoI-4000-2 
> **Size:** 0.5m x 0.2m 
> **Notes:** An advert for Cola-Cola was spontaneously tattooed upon the forehead of child movie star ██████ ████, now PoI-4000-2. Complete removal necessitated surgical excision and grafting, as the advert extended onto the subdermal and dural tissues. The incident was caught quickly enough to quell potential public and familial exposure. This incidentally resulted in cosmetic changes that ended the career of the child. Cover-story regarding a motor vehicle accident distributed. 

> **Instance:** 16 
> **Location:** 45°58′35.0″N 7°39′31.0″E
> **Size:** ~692m x ~674m 
> **Notes:** Advert for a purified, bottled water product, complete with dynamic images depicting individuals hiking with the product prominently displayed. Corporealized upon the South-facing slope of Matterhorn and in the presence of several onlooking hikers. The possibility that SCP-4000 is "learning" to target certain demographics is now being investigated as legitimate.

> **Notes:** Several adverts for McDonald’s appeared at various locations on players’ jerseys over the course of the second quarter of an NBA game. The event was broadcast to an estimated audience of 1,180,000 viewers. Engineered countermemetics were promptly displayed in place of commercial inserts. Neither the percentage of viewers who noticed the manifestation nor the success of the counterinnocuoation can be accurately estimated.

> **Location:** Penn State University 
> **Size:** 54m x 28m 
> **Notes:** Several hundred were killed at a football game wherein a “white out” [[footnote]]An intimidation tactic where all or most of the supporters of a home team coordinate to wear clothing of an indentical color (e.g. everyone is provided with white shirts).[[/footnote]] was being performed. An advertisement covered the reported area, crushing and/or bisecting the civilians as it incorporated into their collective mass. The internal “logic” of SCP-4000 likely misinterpreted the collective as a negative space. Class-naught amnestics distributed via agricultural aircraft, cover-story developed around stadium structural collapse.

The number of individuals exposed is unknown, however local airports were soon thereafter overrun with individuals wanting to travel to the USA. They were treated with class-naught memory impairment, which proved vital to information containment, and were subsequently redispersed. Their numbers were estimated in the 1.5 millions. The advertisement vanished shortly after a storm system arrived in the area 2 days later.

[[tab Incident HABSPA]]

+++ Incident HABSPA
On 7/5/17, the Foundation insignia appeared over the course of approximately twelve minutes upon the surface of an inflated hot air balloon which was participating in the annual European Balloon Festival in Igualada, Spain. Upon its recognition by field agents, an aerial unit was dispatched to escort the aircraft to a remote location. Upon landing, the insignia was found to be indistinguishable from the material used to construct the envelope of the balloon. 

The witnesses were given standard-issue amnestics. However, vestigial curiosity of the insignia and its correlating entity remained, likely due to the strength of the memetic effect in SCP-4000 instantiations. A bivalent effort began to quickly design a highly-communicable counteragent; one branch undertook the creation of an antimeme, the other an amnestic. The result of this pressurized research was the sudden development of “class-naught” bacterioamnestics[[footnote]]Amnestic chemicals continually produced as waste products of genetically engineered bacteria. One exposure is sufficient to colonize an individual for a lifetime, the effects not being susceptible to [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/schulman-ny-programmable-mnestic-device-ac34d-nc77q-95dcs |programmable mnestic devices]]]. For more information, see Foundation patent 488202-488204. [[/footnote]], which were applied successfully across a radius of ~120.89m^^2^^, effectively amnesticizing an estimated 94,309 individuals. [[footnote]]This remains one of the largest, prophylactic mass-amnesticizatoins on record.[[/footnote]]

The passengers of the balloon were reconnoitered and questioned. All denied knowledge of the insignia's presence. They were deemed reliable and released after chronic installment of the mentioned class-naught amnestics. After 4 days of isolation in storage at the nearest provisional site, the insignia disappeared from the surface of the balloon (confirmational footage remains). It has been theorized that this was due, at least in part, to a diminishment of potential viewership, which the instantiation may have somehow been sensitive to. Additional containment procedures are being authored that incorporate the isolation of movable instances.

Instantiations of SCP-4000 that appear on transportable surfaces that are not successfully treated by initial methods are to be mobilized into Foundation-supervised concealment for a minimum of four days. This is particularly indicated for individuals who experience manifestations upon the skin. Such individuals are to be acquired by clandestine means and maintained in a medically induced coma while managed by Foundation medical services for purposes of both cost and informational containment. Those in relational proximity to the contained individual are to be subject to the indicated memory impairment until the contained individual is released.<br>

//On 7/13/18, an instance of SCP-4000 appeared on Foundation Site-49's Eastern wall of the Weaponry annex that was heat-branded upon the building material. The advert, the manifestation of which was captured by video feeds, was a placeholder which read "Ad space available, inquire at [REDACTED]." Upon calling the number, an individual who referred to himself as "Miguel" answered. Below are transcripts of all conversations.//

> **7/14/18**
> 
> //(The line rings.)//
> 
> **Miguel:** And who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?
> 
> **Agent Belopolsky:** This is Agent Charles Belopolsky.
> 
> **Miguel:** Ah, from the Foundation, yes? Fantastic organization. Just great.
> 
> **Agent Belopolsky:** So you've planted the number specifically for us?
> 
> **Miguel:** Naturally.
> 
> **Agent Belopolsky:** I'm afraid nothing about this is natural. 
> 
> **Miguel:** Nah. Nothing comes more naturally to me than business, ok'a? And I've got a //lot// of money, ok'a? //A lot.// How do you think I got it? Real estate ads. Now it's everything ads. Everybody wants a piece of Miguel. You must have been tasked with finding out how my marketing services operate. Of course. Well that means I have quite an audience. Quite an informational presentation I've got for you here. //(excitedly)// Oh is O5 listening as well? Hello! Great stuff, really. Truly.
> 
> **Agent Belopolsky:** How is it that you know of us?
> 
> **Miguel:** The Foundation? Ca'mon. From my history lessons. We've been taught all about the big Foundation. Y'all were the best. Were. Unbelievable though. Without you, or your anomalies rather, the wars would be much less interesting, much less profitable. What a treasure trove. Just sitting there, all with their own addresses and instructions. Just great. 
>  
> **Agent Belopolsky:** I see. History lessons.
> 
> **Miguel:** Yes. I love history. I have some powerful blood, lemme tell you. Great figures in my bloodline. Truly.
> 
> **Agent Belopolsky:** I don't quite understand.
> 
> **Miguel:** Come on now, yes you do. Don't make me spell it out exactly, someone could be listening, or writing memos or something. Temporal anomalies, shifts, integrations, re-integrations, displacements...it's all there in your database already, no? Oops...or don't you have the required clearance level for those? Nice. Right, I forgot about that tiered system. I barely passed that class if I recall correctly...it was some time ago...bad teacher. I told that teacher she was fired, and she was. A little executive at 9 years old, can'ya believe it?! I sure can. Good grades otherwise, trust me, the best.
> 
> **Agent Belopolsky:** I get it. If you're from the future and such temporal maneuvers are possible, then how haven't we been contacted by say, one of our own? Surely we would have important information to tell ourselves.
> 
> **Miguel:** I may have violated some minor intertemporilary laws to be here. Easy for an individual of my persuasion and influence to do. Oops there I go. Ah well. Not that you have the jurisdiction to do anything about it. Or the capability. Only Nestlé does...Johnson&Johnson too, maybe. Maybe Johnson&Johnson. Definitely not anybody else, not you guys, not anymore. Me, soon, very soon. We’ll see...what you don't believe me? Trust me when I say this: believe me. Ok? 
> 
> **Agent Belopolsky:** I see. So you are a...trans-chronal felon? 
>  
> **Miguel:** Well it's not felonious really, just sort of illegal. I'd use "alternative mogul". Very alternative. Besides, the investigations are "ongoing", aren't they? Yes they are. And they can't really end if I keep committing crimes, can they? //(chuckles)// I'm kidding. I'm a kidder. People think I’m very funny, strangers do too.
> 
> **Agent Belopolsky:** ...
> 
> **Miguel:** Did I lose you there? Tell me if you can hear me. Hello? 
>  
> **Agent Belopolsky:** I'm here.
> 
> **Miguel:** Oh. I thought "Damn AT&T". Is that who you use? They are really losing territory. Had several thousand employees fired too, poor souls. They are nobodies, but c'mon, that's poor cost containment. Poor management, you gotta have good managerial leadership to survive out there. Like my forefathers. You're receiving orders through the feed from your peers probably. Am I right? I have a knack for being right. That's what led me to start this business. If you could see me right now, you'd be able to tell how successful I am. How successful? Real successful, I tell you. I'm...really good.
> 
> **Agent Belopolsky:** Let's cut the shit. We're interested in the "history" of the Foundation.
>  
> **Miguel:** Of course. Well I won't say much, so you know. Let’s be clear. The more I stir up here in the film(?), the faster I get the Trustees knocking on my door. Ads, even big ones, are one thing...but...information of that nature is so sensitive not even your O5's could dream of it. Believe me. I'm here to simply offer you monetary and military leverage in the decades to come, enough to compete with the corporations. One day you won't be containing anomalies, but CEOs, unnaturally powerful CEOs. Now. You’ve witnessed the influence I can create; so lets make a deal.
>  
> **Agent Belopolsky:** Sounds like you did fail your history lessons. 
>  
> **Miguel:** Not failed, no. That’s fake, just rumors. Who told you that?
> 
> **Agent Belopolsky:** There are very few if any agencies or entities in better martial posturing than we are right now. I don't see that changing or being challenged by any corporation, much less most governments. You know, you aren't very prepared for this. You haven't thought of how we would be able to trust you; you could be a saboteur. Maybe we're imposingly successful in the future and that's why you're here. With a Trojan horse.
> 
> **Miguel:** A Trogan wha? Sir, I am in the business of retrospective economic warfare...a black market operation of course, but the whole of the war effort is really...comparatively, I am benign, really. I'm not a bad esé. No. So many others are crooked and need to be put into the void(?), trust me. But not me, not me. Listen, I am coming to you...with an offer that is mutualistic. That's all I'm here for. I am a man of my word, you'll see. Trust me. Plus I already put an ad basically on your front door; I’ve got no tricks, could’ve and would’ve by now. No. That I'm offering you some help should be a hint to you. Ca'mon. Ok I’ll say this about your fine organization; turns out it is much easier to gain territory and employees when you don’t have to remain a secret from the masses.
>  
> **Agent Belopolsky:** Why contact us via telephone of all things?
>  
> **Miguel:** It's a forgotten technology. Less likely that the Trustees will catch on.
>  
> **Agent Belopolsky:** You've mentioned war three times now. I assume it is between these Trustees?
>  
> **Miguel:** Oh yes. I started this operation just before the seventh Great Corporate War actually. I started with a small loan, really, quite small.
>  
> **Agent Belopolsky:** You're stretching our disbelief.
> 
> **Miguel:** Really? Is your clairvoyance really that underdeveloped? Sorry, I'm sorry really. That's no way to treat a potential client. I'm a nice guy, a good guy, trust me. Really. Look, I am genuinely shocked this is an alarming concept to you. You are a funny man. All I can say really is that communism will not win. You guys still got commies? 
> 
> **Agent Belopolsky:** You influence the assets of major corporations as part of an intracapitalist war effort?
> 
> **Miguel:** Rather close to home of a concept actually, isn't it? A bit backwards in these days...the corporations hide behind the war efforts instead of outwardly sponsoring them. But yes, we don't use the word "nation" or "country" anymore. Those are silly, archaic words that will get you laughed at. Trust me. Not that I've been laughed at, I haven't. People take me very seriously. Very. Unless I’m making them laugh. It's all corporations though, they run it all. All religions are sponsored by companies. Some have become ones themselves. We have ads inserted into our dreams and onto our mirrors in the morning. Nestlé sponsors the very act of eating; 23rd Century Fox, copulation. This is all normal, real normal. Bottled water could have been your bit of foreshadowing, but hey. Nobody's perfect, mkay? Not even yours truly. Close though, very very close. Now are you interested in purchasing some ad space or not?
> 
> **Agent Belopolsky:** Of course we aren't. I thought you were the clairvoyant one. 
> 
> **Miguel:** Shame. Why do you think I made such a splash with these ads? You're welcome for the bacterioamnestics by the way. That was me. Welcome, O5, yes hello, hello! I mean we //really// could tap some of the fledgling interdimensional markets together. It'd be the best, no one has better access than me, no one. So if you ever want to put those anomalous temporal spaces to good use, you know what number to call, Agent Ambassador. Mm-hmm. We'll see folks, we'll see. Buh-bye.

> //(The line rings.)//
> 
> **Miguel:** Yellow?
> 
> **Agent Belopolsky:** This is Charles Belopolsky.
> 
> **Miguel:** Is this the media? I'm tired of your inaccurate coverage.
> 
> **Agent Belopolsky:** No, I'm with the Foundation.
> 
> **Miguel:** Wait wait. Just wait. I know who you are ok? I remember. You're Clairvoyant Chuck. See? I have a great memory...one of the best ever. I am the least forgetful person you have ever seen, uh'k? Now what can I do for you Ambassador?
> 
> **Agent Belopolsky:** We're prepared to make a deal.
> 
> **Miguel:** Ah! Perfect, perfect. You bluebird. I shouldn't say it, but I knew you'd call back. I have a way with deals. It's in my bloodline. So what are we looking at here? Info for money? Let me post up a bant and we will get this rolling.
> 
> **Agent Belopolsky:** We'll pay to you reproduce the Foundation logo within the headquarters of a GoI. Are you around a console?
> 
> **Miguel:** Yes.
> 
> **Agent Belopolsky:** I'm going to give you the reference code. It's A039d.
> 
> **Miguel:** I see. Okay okay. //(can be heard chuckling)// Wow, but is anybody really surprised? Oh my. A rival GoI, eh? I see why you came to Miguel.
> 
> **Agent Belopolsky:** They currently do not have the requisite measures to qualify as a "rival". In any case, we'd like just some sporadic insignias if possible, preferably with a morale-reducing memetic in-tow. 
> 
> **Miguel:** Ah, I see. There's just one problem, bub.
> 
> **Agent Belopolsky:** What's that?
> 
> **Miguel:** I can materialize the ads, but I can't guarantee they'll stay for very long.
> 
> **Agent Belopolsky:** Why?
> 
> **Miguel:** The numbers. It's no good. To stay, the ads need a certain amount of attention focused upon them to work. Very advanced for you. High-tech stuff, believe me. I guess it's kinda like the old solar energy panels you all are gaga for. What a farce. Blackouts everywhere. That damn Obama. What a mistake.
> 
> **Agent Belopolsky:** That isn't really the crux of the matter, we don't need the help. Truthfully, it's the only way the Ethics committee would approve the transaction, and so the information we want. So just do what you can.
> 
> **Miguel:** Right. Ethics. What a farce. Blackouts everywhere. What a mistake. That damn Obama.
> 
> **Agent Belopolsky:** How will we pay you?
> 
> **Miguel:** Write me an I.O.U. in official letterhead. I'll have it cashed in my time...there's a nice deflation going on now, conversion factor is good. Real good for Miguel. Not surprised.
> 
> **Agent Belopolsky:** So we do still exist by your time.
> 
> **Miguel:** Oops. That one was a freebie. But you didn't pull the sheet over my eyes, no. Just a little aperitif to whet your whistle. Big stuff once I can get it cashed. Not that money is that big of a deal to me, I have plenty. Just a way to keep score now.
> 
> **Agent Belopolsky:** How long until we know it has been credit--
> 
> **Miguel:** It's done. Right, what do you want to know?
> 
> **Agent Belopolsky:** I'm not sure if you know this, but the incidence of the ads has increased 200-fold in the last six months. They are becoming bolder and more reckless in their manifestations and becoming much harder to deal with because of it. One was found within [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-915 |SCP-915]]] for God’s sake. For IBM. 
> 
> **Miguel:** Oo. It tapped the interdimensions. Beautiful. Not ostentatious, but effective. Nice word, I know what you're thinking. I do have some great words. What can I say? As for your problem...you know, my great, great grandmother passed down the advice that your kids aren't really our own. And they aren't, are they? Sure they look like us. Despite cosmetic surgeries even. But we are the bow. And they? They are the arrow, see? They...become a bow themselves. In time I guess. Anyway, doesn't matter. That's a big thought. Don't steal that one. I think big. //A lot//. Sometimes my thoughts are too big for even my great words, you know? 
> 
> **Agent Belopolsky:** Are you or are you not in control of SCP-4000?
> 
> **Miguel:** That's what you call it? Sounds like a bad sci-fi movie. That's a mess. Look. I didn't design it, I funded it. I got it taken care of. Now I use it because that's how I told them to make it. Best thing since the printing press. If I wanted to do all the work and learning and evolving myself, I wouldn't have payed for it in the first place, now huh? Doesn't make sense.
> 
> **Agent Belopolsky:** I think we've heard what we need to. You better find a way to rein in its behavior because this has the potential to get out of hand quick and be to both of our detriments. 
> 
> **Miguel:** Hmm. I never thought about it that way. Whoops. Ironic, huh? One of those self-fulfilling prominences or something, right?  
> 
> **Agent Belopolsky:** For all your self-praise, you're a very unpleasant individual to do business with, and I want you to know that is not just from me, but from the O5 too. 
> 
> **Miguel:** C'mon that's not nice. I think I'm a nice person. I like me. People who know me, they know.
> 
> **Agent Belopolsky:** How does it work? 
> 
> **Miguel:** Ok here's the story, folks. Uh'k? The digital--
> 
> //(The call is interrupted by a 0:30 second ad for hair restoration services. This portion of the audio has been omitted.)//
> 
> **Miguel:**...The digital part is easy. Your code is so primitive. It has a lot of problems. Probably created by immigrants. I’m very popular with the immigrants by the way. Some come from lovely planets. Lovely. The immigrants love me, absolutely love me. I am part Hispanic myself.
> 
> **Agent Belopolsky:** That is the lesser of the anomalous behaviors. What about the physical manifestations?
> 
> **Miguel:** What you don't know? C'mon. Don't make me spell it out for you. You already know this, the big Foundation. Right?
> 
> **Agent Belopolsky:** I'm not sure you even know.
> 
> **Miguel:** Of course I know. I payed for it. I'm not sure you could comprehend it. Not like I can. Because I can. Sure. There is no difference between the digital and physical. It’s all from the same bag.
> 
> **Agent Belopolsky:** You //just// said the digital deals by manipulating code.
> 
> **Miguel:** Quiet. I know what I just said, uh'k? This conversation is over. Thank you. It's over, folks. Capisce? That's enough. Thank you. Thank you very much.
>

> 
> **Miguel:** Clairvoyant Chuck!
> 
> **:** No Belopolsky is dead. 
> 
> **Miguel:** Oh. Shame. He was a nobody really. They’ve already gotten a replacement. 
> 
> **:** Not quite. You can call me O-7. 
> 
> **Miguel:** Well. Hello. A great summit this will be. Truly great. My family has a history of being strong diplomats. 
> 
> **O-7:** The autopsy of Belopolsky showed massive pulmonary infection secondary to foreign bodies in the lungs. It wasn't food that he aspirated like we thought; it was ads. Your ads. So you can see we’ve got a big problem here.
> 
> **Miguel:** Hm. Not sure I can be held responsible. Maybe. Maybe not. No evidence of involvement in that. Not a drop. Go ahead and look, won’t find a thing. Guaranteed. I don't see how it wouldn't be me. Sorry, I meant to say that I don't see how it //would// be me. //Would.// Just a clarification there, sort of a double-negative. Should have been clear enough though I think.
> 
> **O-7:** As much as we respect and want to honor Agent Belopolsky, we have more pressing matters to solve right now than justice for his untimely death, and he would agree. We're more interested in finding out //anything// from you that might help contain this monstrosity. It is //creating// spaces for itself now. There are ads //everywhere//. They’re in the database, in the procedures, on the walls of our chambers, in the fucking bathroom stalls. We can barely get our work done here. Our communication lines are starting to feature ads Miguel, asking for use to subscribe to some voice-to-speech software in order to get rid of them. This is in the field, //lives// are on the line. 
> 
> **Miguel:** Hmm...you know we said these calls would be about business. And this one isn't, uh'k? It's not. You are lying and are a liar. If we wa-
> 
> **O-7:** //(interrupting)// It's found and internalized [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/preface-to-practical-logopsychology/ |our research into exploitable cognito-efficacious environmental stimuli.]]] Its mimicry is becoming frighteningly precise. I just clicked on what I thought was a L-5 security clearance lock and now I’m getting spam emails about identity protection. We're having to modify our database's formatting in response but its adaptability is something we can't get far enough ahead of. Now, if you can help us, we are willing to compensate you for your help. 
> 
> **Miguel:**  Hmm. Business. Ok I see. Deal. Well she's never done this on our end. It seems the film(?) of your time is less reinforced. Weak. It probably can sniff that and sees its opening. Shame. Good for business though. 
> 
> **O-7:** You’ve got to know //something// about how this thing you’re running works.  Or did you literally just buy your way into it?
> 
> **Miguel:** I’ve got the best brain. Trust me, it’s yuge(?). Ok? Yuge(?). 
> 
> **O-7:** Is that so? Ok let me pick at that great brain of yours. Walter D. Scott.[[footnote]]May 1, 1869 – September 24, 1955. Created a philosophy of advertising that explicitly engaged the basal feelings of the purchaser (i.e. love, despise, and fear). This method of publicizing was highly successful and substantially impacted future techniques. His work established the role of psychology in modern publicizing.[[/footnote]] Albert Lasker.[[footnote]]May 1, 1880 – May 30, 1952. First conceptualized of radio and television as a medium to be driven by advertising. Created the soap opera. In 1920, he contributed his ideas and techniques to the presidential campaign of Republican Warren Harding, 29th President of the United States, who won by a landslide: Harding obtained the highest percent of the popular vote since the advancement of the two-party framework (60%) along with 404 of 531 electoral votes.[[/footnote]] Edward Bernays.[[footnote]]November 22, 1891 − March 9, 1995. Nephew of Sigmund Freud. Stipulated that evolutionary drives could be exploited by a corporate elite for economic gain and that enormous business could satisfy the longings of a characteristically unreasonable and appetite-driven mass. Articulated how those so inclined could utilize psychology and psychoanalysis to do so.[[/footnote]] Leo Burnett. [[footnote]]October 21, 1891 – June 7, 1971. Created Tony the Tiger, the Jolly Green Giant, and the Marlboro Man. Synthesized the idea of a product and a personality becoming synonymous such that the sale was more about the latter.[[/footnote]] Do these names mean anything to you?
> 
> **Miguel:** Oh yes. Phenomenal. Some of the best. Really. Them and Micheal Bisqueaux[[footnote]]No record of such an individual’s contributions to the field of advertising currently exists.[[/footnote]], Jaden Farmer[[footnote]]No record of such an individual’s contributions to the field of advertising currently exists.[[/footnote]] and uh, ol what’s his name, Benjamin Franklin. These people and their predecesors; genius. While most saw a WWI airplane spiraling out of control and thought "Oh my that pilot is out of control and is likely to die," these guys thought things like "I wonder if I could use smoke like that to write an ad in the sky." Marvelous. Really pushed the ad from explanation and exaggeration to exploitation. Just genius I tell you. They’re all regarded really as heroes in the modern age and for good reason. You will know of their significance in a few hundred years I bet. Took it a while to catch on, always does.
> 
> **O-7:** Why do you remember Benjamin Franklin?
> 
> **Miguel:** He was the first to put illustrations in advertisements.
> 
> **O-7:** Not for his other contributions?
> 
> **Miguel:** What other contributions? Oh yeah those too, those too. Good guy. Never met him. 
> 
> **O-7:** I see. You know Miguel, you can glean a lot of information about a society by looking to who they revere. But you can glean even more about who's pulling the strings. We may never have suspected advertising of all things giving rise to a possible Holocene-class extinction scenario. I’d like to thank you for giving us such a forewarning on the current timeline’s natural course. You've caused quite a bother but as you've heard it said; “Sometimes by losing the battle, you find a way to win the war.”[[footnote]]- Donald J. Trump, 45th President of the United States of America. [[/footnote]] I think we will ultimately be better off now that we've met. You've been a bittersweet catalyst.
> 
> **Miguel:** Oops. Well. Glad to be of service. Always happy to make a client happy. There’s an art form to the deal you know, I know you’ve learned something, if you’ve been paying attention. There’s always a good deal with Miguel. I like that quote you said too. Heard it as a kid somewhere. Not sure who said that. Someone great, lemme tell ya. Real great. Anyway. Nice doing business. You’ll know how to contact me if we can do more.

> **O-7:** No, we won't.

//The Foundation was unable to successfully detain PoI-4000-01; after each call, a discarded burner phone with a matching number was located within a 25 m radius of the positive trace, despite the contact number never varying between calls. Transaction records have been inconclusive.//

//Forensic data gathered from the phones share a 6.25% match with ██████ ████ █████. The percent suggests PoI-4000-1 is related to the individual as a fourth-degree relative. The time-frame supplied by PoI-4000-1 ("23rd century", "a few hundred years") is congruous with this assessment. The genealogy of PoI-4000-1 is currently being deduced.//
 
//**Update:** The genealogy of PoI-4000-1 has been mapped with a confidence interval of 98.9%.//

//**Update:** The biological material collected from the phones thought to have been used by PoI-4000-1 no longer exists. No additional material is able to be recovered from the phones. New instances of SCP-4000 persist. Expeditious engineering of a Thaumiel-class ad-blocker remains a top Foundation priority.//
