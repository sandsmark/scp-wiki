title:Dr. Trebuchet's Personnel File
**Name:** Dr. Epiphany "Piffy" Trebuchet

**Security Clearance:** Level 2/811-135-023

**Occupation:** Researcher. Primarily works with Euclid-level SCPs of a biological nature.

**Facility Location:** Usually Bio-Research Area-12.

**Profile:** Dr. Trebuchet is one of the Foundation's most diminutive and least talkative researchers, but possibly one of its most obsessively dedicated. She is 31 years old, slightly over one metre tall, and requires a two-step foot stool to be present in any lab she happens to be working in. Her combined chronic insomnia and extreme workaholic tendencies have led to her almost never actually going home.







[[UNDER CONSTRUCTION]]


Dr. Trebuchet has the unfortunate condition of her body being trapped within a Class-██ ("snap-back") temporal loop, while her mind exists outside of said loop. The loop resets every twelve hours, as she hits the peak of rigour mortis, at which point her body reverts to its precise state at the time of her death. She reports that this reversion process "hurts like a mother[REDACTED]", and is exacerbated by the presence of foreign materials or physical damage to her body, making eating inadvisable. 

As consequence of being clinically dead, Dr. Trebuchet does not have a pulse, does not need to breathe, does not generate internal heat, and her manual dexterity gradually degrades over the twelve-hour cycle of the temporal loop. As a consequence of being eternally trapped in the body of a six-year-old child, Dr. Trebuchet has no sex drive, is eye-level with the lower edge of a standard counter top, and is frequently seen dragging around a two-step footstool. She exhibits some behaviors consistent with 6-year-old brain chemistry, such as an adherence to rules rather than having any sense of morals or ethics, a marked lack of empathy for other people, a love for experimenting with new words, and a desire to be praised. Conversely, other behaviors are more reflective of her 29 years of life experience; she has a firm grasp of cause and effect, attempts to explain the phenomena around her scientifically rather than accepting "magic" or other fanciful answers, and has cultivated the ability to predict the consequences of her actions by rote memorization of what happened when someone else did something similar.

Dr. Trebuchet is a dedicated workaholic; she can't stand being idle. This, combined with her incredibly high pain threshold and tolerance, mean that, once she has started a task, it's nearly impossible to drag her away from it until it is completed. Because of this, and the fact that she is small, light, and her maximum ambulatory speed is a hurried shuffle, her lab coat has been outfitted with a reinforced cloth strap so that she can be more easily transported out of danger in an emergency. It should be noted that she does //not// appreciate being "dufflebagged" in non-emergency situations.

In addition, Dr. Trebuchet suffers severely from the speech impediment known as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoonerism Spoonerisms]. She has sought speech therapy to rectify this, but it has been, so far, largely ineffective. People who make fun of her for it will have their toes stomped on, or shins kicked.

For full profile information, including effective methods for temporary termination, Level-4 personnel should refer to document [DATA EXPUNGED]. Permanent termination is not considered possible at this time.

**History:** Dr. Trebuchet is the first person on record to have touched a Type-█████ temporal anomaly with their bare skin. She was brought into Foundation custody by Mobile Task Force Nu-1. Tests with lab animals and human subjects have confirmed that Dr. Trebuchet's condition //always// occurs when a living being makes direct contact with a Type-█████. Subsequent tests conclude that beings affected by Type-█████ temporal anomalies cannot perceive or interact with other Type-█████ anomalies.

The O5 command authorized use of victims of Type-█████ anomalies as reusable D-class personnel for experiments with lethal non-memetic, non-infectious SCP items. Trebuchet served in this capacity for ten years, during which time she spent nearly all of her free time reading text books and trying to further her own education. She wrote a thesis on [DATA EXPUNGED] and its implications in the field of neurobiology, and brought it to Dr. M████████ for proof-reading. She was subsequently promoted to lab assistant, and worked her way up to a biology doctorate over the next seven years. At the time of this writing, she has been a Doctor at Bio-Research Area-12 for nine years.
