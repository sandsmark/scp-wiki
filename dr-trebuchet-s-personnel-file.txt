title:Dr. Trebuchet's Personnel File
**Name:** Dr. Epiphany "Piffy" Trebuchet

**Security Clearance:** Level 2/811-135-023

**Occupation:** Researcher. Primarily works with Euclid-level SCPs of a biological nature.

**Facility Location:** Usually Bio-Research Area-12.

**Profile:** Dr. Trebuchet is one of the Foundation's most diminutive and least talkative researchers, but possibly one of its most obsessively dedicated. She is 31 years old, slightly over one metre tall, and requires a two-step foot stool to be present in any lab she happens to be working in. Her combined chronic insomnia and extreme workaholic tendencies have led to her almost never actually going home. When she //does// sleep, it's usually on her lab's "crash cot", and late-night snack raids of the cafeteria are frequent. On the occasions that Dr. Trebuchet does speak, it is often in Spoonerisms, and she is very selfconscious about this.

Medical assessment indicates a complete dependence on (and apparently ever-increasing tolerance to) pharmaceutical sleep aids. Current prescribed dosage of [REDACTED] is ████mg, almost █ times the LD50.
