[[span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva;"]] [[size 350%]]O.Z.[[/size]] [[/span]]  [[span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva;"]] [[size 125%]] //(Short for Organic Zoolodraconimolluscaform)// [[/size]] [[/span]] is the name given to a squishy, dragon/slug-like creature that appeared at Site-██ on October 9, 2013.  Since its arrival, it has commonly been an object of affection and petting due to its adorable, yet somewhat slimy, appearance, and cute personality. It is usually found in its cushion/bean-bag-filled room taking naps, or in the cafeteria/kitchen munching on ice cream and waffles.

Occasionally, it accompanies a Researcher on a trip for moral support, and for hopping around chasing butterflies and dandelions.  It can also serve as a mode of transportation by consuming large amounts of sweets and becoming a giant, squishy tank capable of firing candy missiles.

O.Z. is not, contrary to popular belief in Site-██, ooey, gooey, rich, and chewy, though it might be willing to share its candy stockpile with you if you are nice to it.  //(Except the mochi; that's all for it, and it alone)//

Below is a list of anomalies and events O.Z. has witnessed:

* [[[SCP-1762]]] //IRL Commentary:// This was the first Skip I ever posted to the main site, and I must say I am extremely proud of how it turned out.  Though of course, if it involves origami, and it involves dragons, I'm gonna like it, but I honestly do think this was a great first SCP.

* [[[SCP-2988]]] //IRL Commentary:// I love the Pitch Haven series, so I really wanted to write something for it, and that's what I did here! Also, finally got to implement an old idea of disembodied hands/arms from a much older, unrelated draft.

* [[[SCP-2954]]] //IRL Commentary:// I began with the hope that I would just have fun with this one, and in the end, I did indeed.  Some people might find this a bit nostalgic //(I know I drew a lot of inspiration from hours of watching old Showa era monster movies as a kid)//, others might not have a lot of connection.  I'm fine either way; it was fun. :3

* [[[SCP-489]]] //IRL Commentary://  An idea that spontaneously began to form after some brainstorming/screwing around in the chatroom, I took a silly idea about an exterminator with problems and turned it into 489.  It's goofy, it's oddly charming, and I got a Series 1 slot, so yay!

* [[[A Circus Milked Dry]]] 
* [[[A Circus of a Wreck]]]
* [[[A Circus With Paranoia]]]

All of my Circus Clowns Tales were fun to write, mainly because there are so many things you can do with shape-shifting Eldritch Clowns.  A big key point in these Tales came from [[[SCP-1921]]]. CLOWN MILK.

* [[[Free Freaks]]]

Another Circus Tale involving people of the freak show. I'll eventually write a sequel, but honestly having a bit of writer's block on how to proceed.

* [[[Bigfoot's Eulogy]]]

Though 1762 was my first SCP, and so far highest-rated article, Bigfoot's Eulogy was my //very first// article ever posted.
