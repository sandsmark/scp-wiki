O.Z. //(Short for Organic Zoolodraconimolluscaform)// is the name given to a squishy, dragon/slug-like creature that appeared at Site-██ on October 9, 2013.  Since its arrival, it has commonly been an object of affection and petting due to its adorable, yet somewhat slimy, appearance, and cute personality. It is usually found in its cushion/bean-bag-filled room taking naps, or in the cafeteria/kitchen munching on ice cream and waffles.

Occasionally, it accompanies a Researcher on a trip for moral support, and for hopping around chasing butterflies and dandelions.  It can also serve as a mode of transportation by consuming large amounts of sweets and becoming a giant, squishy tank capable of firing candy missiles.

O.Z. is not, contrary to popular belief in Site-██, ooey, gooey, rich, and chewy, though it might be willing to share its candy stockpile with you if you are nice to it.  //(Except the mochi; that's all for it, and it alone)//

Below is a list of anomalies and events O.Z. has witnessed:

++ SCPs

* [[[SCP-1762]]]
* [[[SCP-2988]]]

++ Travel Logs

* [[[A Circus Milked Dry]]]
* [[[A Circus of a Wreck]]]
* [[[A Circus With Paranoia]]]

* [[[Free Freaks]]]

* [[[Bigfoot's Eulogy]]]
