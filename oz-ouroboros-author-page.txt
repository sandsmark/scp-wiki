O.Z. //(Short for Organic Zoolodraconianatidaeform)// is the name given to a squishy, dragon/duck-like creature that appeared at Site-██ on October 9, 2013.  Since its arrival, it has commonly been an object of annoyance due to its incessant quacking. It usually is found in the cafeteria quacking and attempting to force its way into the bread and Cheerios closet, much to the chagrin of staff.

Occasionally, it accompanies a Researcher on a trip so on-site personnel can be relieved of its quackiness.

O.Z. is not, contrary to popular belief in Site-██, capable of breathing fire though personnel have reported that it will suddenly appear in their office and stare at them with a fiery gaze until they leave from discomfort.

Below is a list of anomalies and events O.Z. has witnessed:

++ SCPs

* [[[SCP-1762]]]

++ Travel Logs

* [[[A Circus Milked Dry]]]
* [[[A Circus of a Wreck]]]
* [[[A Circus With Paranoia]]]

* [[[Free Freaks]]]

* [[[Bigfoot's Eulogy]]]
