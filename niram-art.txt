Hello! I'm [[*user niram]], aka ramni/naelyati, and this is my art page. Long time lurker, joined only recently.
I do illustration and concept art. Most of them are Nälkä(Sarkic) related for now, but I might do art based on other SCPs/Canons in the future....

You can find me on: 
[https://twitter.com/sone_suraas Twitter](mostly rambling in another language and occasionally art)
[https://naelyati.tumblr.com/ Tumblr](mostly inactive and mainly for art archive purposes)
[https://www.instagram.com/niramnaelyati/ Instagram](maintaining several SNS accounts at once never ended well for me but here goes nothing)
[https://www.artstation.com/naelyati Artstation](trying to be serious about art with various degrees of success)

(this is based on a Korean belief/colloquialism that hated people will basically never die no matter how much you want them to so being mad at them is pretty counterproductive, or something like that but of course our favorite meat wizard decides to go and misinterpret it. Get insulted, become gods!)--okay now that i explained the joke it's even less fun-- [[/collapsible]]
