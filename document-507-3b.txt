**Foreword:** Below is an archive of all documented “shifts” undergone by [[[SCP-507]]]. Each of these entries are presented with their contents in the following order:
* Dimensional label (created upon discovery of a “new” reality, for ease of later reference) 
* Retrieval (used for the documentation of any complications or anomalies in the recovery of SCP-507 post-shift)
* Description of reality, and description of any aftereffects caused by visiting said reality.
* Request (listings of any special requests made by 507 upon return, or for noting any ”souvenirs” retrieved from the shift)

**1B7-55E-728**
Retrieval: Uneventful.

Subject arrived in a desert environment, and wandered around for roughly an hour before encountering another human. Said human was wearing a tanned leather overcoat and was described as "completely unshaven." Said man was extremely surprised to find the subject, and demanded that he be followed in order to lead it back to food and shelter.

Subject originally began to follow the man, but intentionally lost contact with him upon noticing that his leather coat contained no seams or stitching. 

* Request: None.

**9E2-66V-7HG5**
Retrieval: Uneventful.

Subject arrived in a forest habitat, with no signs of previous or current industrialization. No further anomalies were perceptible until the subject grew hungry, at which point it discovered that harvesting or eating the plant life would cause them to emit “telepathic screams”. Subject abstained from eating for the first day because of this, but became hungry enough on the second day onward to consume the flora in spite of the screams.

Testing has shown no biological changes in the subject from this, but subject repeatedly affirms that it “felt horrible” for doing so.

* Request: None specifically, but subject adopted a gelatin- and pudding-based diet for two and a half weeks after returning from this shift.

**J75-R63-3TF**
Retrieval: Uneventful.

Subject arrived in a dimension with flipped genders. No notable differences besides this were discovered, although subject found issue with the fact that its female counterpart “looks pretty much the same” as the standard version.

* Request: None.

**000-000-000** (Invalid)
Retrieval: Via tracking device. Plainclothes agents found subject sitting in an alleyway at ███████, ███████.

Subject was largely unresponsive upon retrieval, and remained so until the standard questioning phase. When asked where it went this shift, subject answered, “Nowhere. I think I missed it this time.”

Subject experienced minor motor skill impairment and decreased activity levels for roughly a month after this shift.

* Request: A nightlight, and a wristwatch which makes an audible “tick” as the second hand moves. Both were approved.

**J7Q-53Y-8ST**
Retrieval: Subject was found in its quarters, sprawled on the floor, attempting to gnaw through the “sleeves” of a straitjacket it was wearing. The jacket, leg restraints, and the loss of motor skills still present from the last shift led to the subject being unable to stand up or open the door to find assistance.

Subject shifted while sleeping, and awoke restrained and lying in a hospital-grade bed. A nurse informed the subject that he was still a patient at the ████ ██ asylum, and was currently suffering from advanced stages of dementia. Subject was then sedated, and spent the rest of this shift alternating between sub-consciousness and total unconsciousness.

* Request: Disregarding “Get this [EXPLETIVE] thing off me,” none.

**9E2-66V-7HG5-2**
Retrieval: Subject found in its quarters, balled up with its hands over its ears.

Subject once again arrived in the forest habitat from 9E2-66V-7HG5. The flora seemed to have remembered subject’s last visit, though, and they reacted by “screaming” for its entire four-day shift.

* Request: A hug. Approved.

**6K3-21B-I0S**
[DATA EXPUNGED]

**BN2-AL6-CTE**
Retrieval: Uneventful.

Subject arrived in a derelict metropolitan area. Subject was unable to locate any other humans, but noted an overabundance of cats in every area it visited. Said felines seemed no different from normal housecats, though, and subject spent most of this shift petting any who came near.

During the standard examination procedures after retrieval, trace amounts of a Toxoplasma gondii variant were discovered on the subject’s clothing, as well as larger amounts on its shoes. Further testing showed that subject had not yet been infected with the Toxoplasmosis variant, most likely attributed to the short timeframe of this shift not allowing the subject to grow hungry and seek out food.

All clothing and belongings that were on subject's person during this shift were incinerated, and the subject forced to undergo special decontamination procedures, in order to prevent any possibility of contagion.

* Request: a pair of rubber gloves. Denied, on the basis that hand protection would not have prevented subject from infection in any way.

**125-28P-OS4-3**
Retrieval: Via tracking device. Subject was attempting to return on its own, but was making less progress than usual due to the discomfort of doing so.

Subject once again arrived in a pitch-black area, with muted breathing nearby. Subject decided to seek an exit this time via blind wandering. Subject eventually found itself at the mouth of a corridor with what appeared to be a light source at the end. Subject began to run towards the light upon noticing this.

As it grew closer, the light suddenly grew in intensity and the subject was exposed to “searing pain.” Subject passed out at this point, and only awoke after it had shifted back.

Examination upon retrieval revealed that the subject’s epidermis had been cleanly stripped down to the stratum granulosum in all areas open to sunlight, and down to the stratum lucidum in all areas covered by clothing.

* Request: None, but subject reappeared wearing a pair of large, heavily tinted sunglasses. Subject did not notice that it was wearing these until they were pointed out, and supposed that they were probably why its eyes did not undergo the same process as its skin.

**7F2-WA3-193**
Retrieval: Uneventful.

Subject arrived in an urban area, with no major changes as far as it could tell. Subject used the public computers of a library to search for differences between this dimension and ours, eventually finding that Abraham Lincoln was assassinated by his Vice President in order to claim his position. This ultimately led to the Presidency becoming a “tribe-leader-like” position, where the current holder is legally allowed to be challenged and overthrown by other suitable candidates.

Subject noted, with great surprise, that this change did not do much to alter the times that most “major” presidents took and held the office. Many of the minor and/or detrimental presidencies tended to end via bullet wounds, often in unlikely locales or from improbable angles, which deterred most from attempting coups at all.

* Request: None.

**WS6-ECU-83D**
Retrieval: Uneventful.

Subject arrived at the mouth of a cave, surrounded by “almost unbearable” heat. Subject walked outside the cave for further investigation, to find that the area around it was a baked wasteland. Most of the heat appeared to emanate from two suns in the sky, which the subject could not decide on whether they were extremely large or extremely close to the planet.

Upon further examination, the “suns” blinked and turned away, taking the heat with them.

Subject spent rest of this shift as far back in the cave as possible.

* Request: None.

**Q56-DRU-865**
Retrieval: Subject found in the cafeteria, masticating on what appeared to be [REDACTED].

Upon containment of [REDACTED], Subject uttered the words, "More! More! More!" before losing consciousness.

Subject regained consciousness 2 hours later, expressing a strong desire for pudding. When questioned, Subject claimed to see "the biggest mound of pudding ever". When questioned as to why it was masticating on [REDACTED] upon arrival, subject claimed to be eating a "glob a pudding" at the time. 

Subject reported seeing [REDACTED] rolling around the hallways. Hallucinations passed within 24 hours.

* Request: Pudding. Request granted.

**F24-9S6-33C**
Retrieval: Subject found in Service Tunnel 6r3bk without original equipment. Subject was wearing a simple uniform with a similar design to the current Foundation D-class uniform.

Subject shifted while dining in the cafeteria. Destination dimension had an analogue to the Foundation with a facility in the same location, although internal layout had significant differences. Security responded to subject as an intruder and detained it immediately. During this process the subject was imprisoned and stripped of all equipment, including tracking device. For remainder of shift subject underwent repeated questioning, the Foundation analogue refused to accept subject's explanation of dimension hopping.

Information gleaned from post-shift debriefing indicates that F24-9S6-33C has a Foundation analogue in the Society for Containment of the Paranormal. This analogue has a strong British influence, and is opposed by the Covert Occult Group and Church of the Mending God. Further details remain unclear as the Society refused to answer the subject's questions and only slipped details by assuming it knew them already.

* Request: Replacement equipment. Request granted.

**4GT-F1Q-H17**
Retrieval: Subject was found by the cafeteria kitchen staff of site-██, drenched, covered in mud, and suffering from severe hypothermia.

Subject arrived in what appeared to be a large field during a rainstorm. Subject attempted to find shelter from the rain, but found none, remaining in the rain for the entire shift. After an unknown length of time, the subject reported seeing entities in the distance. Although the heavy rain obscured the subject from obtaining a detailed report of their appearances, the subject described them as being vaguely humanoid in shape. The entities began to slowly move towards the subject from all directions. Near the end of the shift, the subject reported hearing labored breathing from the nearest entities.

* Requests: a set of warm clothing. Approved

**2AW-9U2-E5T**
Retrieval: Uneventful.

Subject arrived in midair, falling from an outdoor environment into a subterranean body of water at the bottom of a large cavern. Though admittedly experiencing a strong surge of adrenalin from this event, subject reported swimming 'a long way' before reaching land. Subsequent observation revealed a giant hole in the ceiling of the cavern, through which subject had apparently fallen. Also reported were archways to other large caverns, most with shafts of sunlight visible indicating other surface collapses. Regular vertical grooves in the walls indicate possible excavation, despite the caverns' immense size. No other sign of life was observed.

Before returning, subject realized that the possibility of shifting back to our reality so far underground might cause it to be displaced in solid rock, and spent its remaining time frantically searching for a way back to the surface. When subject succeeded, it discovered that the sink holes were much more widespread than what had been visible from below ground.
* Request: Diving Lessons. Denied.

**2UU-5I9-Q3D**
Retrieval: Upon seeing Foundation personnel in ████████, ████, subject approached them and requested to be recontained, showing knowledge of SCPs that were of Level 3 clearance.

The length of time the subject was absent from our reality was notable, being roughly three months in length. However, during this time, it made several notable discoveries, including several SCPs uncontained by our reality's SCP Foundation but contained by Universe 2UU-5I9-Q3D's equivalent. These SCPs have now been contained.

Through this three-month time frame, the subject managed to become a member of 2UU-5I9-Q3D's SCP Foundation equivalent, working its way up the ranks far faster than would have been anticipated assuming it had been made a member of Foundation personnel on the same day. At the time of its return, he was apparently in the field, working to contain 2UU-5I9-Q3D's equivalent of SCP-███. Curiously, our Foundation had sent out a Task Force for precisely the same reason, on the same day. Further links between Universe 2UU-5I9-Q3D and our reality are being investigated.

* Request: To be made a member of Site personnel. Denied.

**3JT-3MD-DIG**
Retrieval:  Subject retrieved via implanted tracker; medevac required to Site ██

Subject was immobile upon retrieval due to greatly increased body mass, measured at ███ kg.  Lead Researcher ██████ approved emergency use of [[[SCP-394]]] to keep it alive in order to obtain a report.

Upon recovery, subject reported being surrounded by "really [EXPLETIVE] big"  creatures resembling ██████████.  They quickly trapped him in a transparent container.  It was then transported an unknown distance to a shiny surface, whereupon the creatures began to observe him.  After approximately one day tubes were inserted into [DATA EXPUNGED] unknown fluid which was not found upon examination.

Subject reported that the tubes were removed shortly before the shift and it observed [REDACTED] approaching it, presumably for the purpose of extraction.

* Request: Services of a personal trainer.  Dr. ████████ has agreed to let the subject borrow her workout tapes.  Subject now displays a strong aversion to pudding.

**9J3-Y6X-GTY**

Retrieval: The subject was found hanging from its ankles in a tree on-site.
Subject was partially encased in insulated, reflective titanium armor upon retrieval.

The subject described the world it had arrived in as "Extra shiny" and stated that it was apprehended by law enforcement officers upon arrival. After being apprehended, the subject was transported to a nearby manufacturing facility and placed upside down on an assembly line where a series of metal sheets were shaped and cut to fit its body. It briefly had time to ask what was going on and was informed that the radiation from the sun was extremely dangerous and titanium reflective suits were required by law to prevent thermal radiation damage to any person or structure.
 
* Request: Sun-screen and an eye exam. Granted.

**52J-O79-3GH**
Retrieval: Via tracking device. Subject was found inside a padlocked metal shed, behind an abandoned house on the outskirts of ███████, ██.

Subject arrived in a small room housing several dried corpses. Besides said corpses, the room was mostly bare; the only things subject noted were a single paneless window and a light fixture on the ceiling which occasionally flickered. Subject attempted to rise to his feet, but had difficulty doing so due to repeated and unpredictable surges of motion.

Subject eventually made its way to the window, at which point it discovered that its “room” was actually a container suspended in midair by a large chain. Subject watched as similar containers passed by him, and as it passed by others, via a complex web of rails above it which the chains were attached to. Subject could see nothing besides this but darkness in all directions.

Subject then tried to “wait out” its time in this dimension by falling asleep, but found it difficult due to a newly discovered quality of the corpses. During moments of darkness caused by flickering, the corpses rearranged themselves into poses which would be logical for living people during that particular moment. If the subject was looking out the window the corpses would be crowded around him in an attempt to get a better view, if the subject was sitting they would also be seated in a pattern to form a full circle, if the subject attempted to reach the light fixture they would act as a support/seem to be in the process of pushing him upwards, etc.

* Request: None. The area which the subject exited, though, has been cordoned off and is currently under surveillance. If no evidence of Foundation-worthy phenomena has been experienced by ██/██/██, an anonymous tip will be sent to local law enforcement agencies so that they can “discover” the crime scene and take appropriate investigative actions on their own.

**YTF-5N2-Q00**
Retrieval: Uneventful

Subject arrived in a crowded casino-like area. Subject noted that the only type of machine available was something similar to slots, but they apparently required no money to play and gave out nothing upon a “win.”

Upon actually sitting down in front of one and trying it, the subject discovered that the machine dispensed a small slip of paper with writing on it upon every pull of the lever and spin of the symbols it displayed. Subject could discern no real pattern to what symbol would produce what type of note, but wrote down a list of its attempts and what it received from each just in case.

[[code]]Jewel/Crescent/Claw: “If given a slice of death, could you tell how large it was?”

Hammer/Crescent/Crescent: “A poor base leads to rushed patch-jobs.”

Crescent/Hammer/Jewel: “Déjà who?”

Claw/Circle/Hammer: “There are things worse than death. For one: Not dying. ”

Crescent/Hammer/Crescent: “There will always be someone to look after you.”

Crescent/Jewel/Crescent: “They’re not that jolly; it’s just stuck that way.”

Hammer/Crescent/Hammer: “There will always be something to look after.”

Claw/Claw/Claw: “The future’s looking bright.”[[/code]]

* Request: None.

**FN3-05P-KHC**
Retrieval: Uneventful

Subject appeared in a white corridor, with steel doors lining both walls. Each door had a keypad, a small speaker system, and a clipboard containing forms written in undecipherable characters.

As the subject approached one door to examine said clipboard, the door’s attached speaker turned on and began to address it. Subject was informed that the voice belonged to the person locked behind that specific door, and that he was wrongfully imprisoned then left to die. The prisoner then pleaded with the subject to release him from his cell.

Subject, jokingly, replied that he would free the prisoner if he promised not to stab the subject upon release. There was roughly a seven second pause before the prisoner asked what “stabbing” was. After a moment of deliberation, the subject defined stabbing as “The creation of a new orifice through the use of a pointed object.”

Another pause followed. The prisoner eventually affirmed that he could not stab the subject, because all of his objects were “very blunt.”

Subject, naturally, did not open that door or any of the others.

* Request: None.

**I52-37G-Z8M**
Retrieval: Via tracking device. Subject was in a holding cell of the ███ █████ police station, under charges of public indecency. Extraction was successfully made with no complications.

Subject arrived in an area apparently undergoing a large snowstorm. Subject attempted to find shelter but could not find its way in the storm, and had almost succumbed to exposure by the time it was located and pulled into a cave by a man covered in protective furs.

The man helped the subject out of its soaked clothing; and although he did not have an extra set of garments, he led the subject to an underground hot spring his cave was connected to. When the man was sure that the subject was regaining its strength, he removed his furs and entered the spring as well.

Subject was extremely surprised to discover that the man was a second SCP-507. Subject noticed no obvious physical differences between itself and the double; although the alternate-507 had a pattern of “tribal scarring” across his torso, as well as at the bases of some of his limbs. Subject and the double remained in the cave and conversed with each other until the subject’s shift ended.

* Request: Subject drew a replica of the alternate-507’s scars from memory, and asked for any information on possible cultural or symbolic meaning behind the patterns. None was found, but Foundation researchers noted that the lines were congruent with incision marks which would be made during a standard [REDACTED]

**S43-51U-P09**
Retrieval: Via tracking device.  Subject recovered in a cornfield in ██████, █████████, with unidentified brown liquid splattered on its cheek.  A human heart with the words "I NEED YOU" written with the same liquid was discovered in subject's hand. Subject claimed that said object was not in its possession during the shift and does not know how it came into its possession.  Researchers are attempting to identify the liquid.

Subject arrived in pitch black darkness, with the sound of crying nearby.  Upon activating its flashlight, subject discovered the "Smiling Man" from previous shifts leaning towards him. Brown liquid leaked from around its sunglasses.  Smiling Man pushed its face closer to subject's and uttered the phrase, "Why did you do this?".  Smiling Man then wiped off a portion of the brown liquid from its eyes with its hand and began caressing subject's cheek with it.

Subject forcefully pushed Smiling Man away.  Subject observed that the Smiling Man's business suit contained several holes, with brown liquid trailing down from them.  Subject drew its firearm and pulled the trigger; however, for unknown reasons, the pistol did not fire.  Smiling Man began slowly walking towards subject.  Subject ran for approximately 10 minutes and spent the rest of the shift huddled in a corner.

* Request: A more reliable pistol.  Denied, as the cause of the error is unknown. 

**9E2-66V-7HG5-3**
Retrieval: Via tracking device. Subject was discovered 7km (6.4 miles) North-East of the facility.

Subject shifted while reading in its quarters. Subject found itself returned to the forest habitat containing telepathic trees.  The trees remained silent upon its entry to the environment. The subject admitted that despite its previous experiences within the environment, it was curious about the dimensions existence. More specifically, where was all the human habitation? The subject propelled itself to the highest ground it could find in order to see over the tree canopy.

The subject found a clearing on the top of a hill. Subject reported seeing a huge semi-translucent blue dome covering the entire forest. The tree canopy extended out to the edge of the dome with foliage so thick that looking up and through it was unfeasible. Subject reported itself to see the dome slightly off-center. Suggesting it was not underneath the direct middle.

* Request: None.

**5Z4-75T-7YB**
Retrieval: Subject was found prone and unresponsive in its quarters. Subject was bleeding significantly. Several deep gashes were discovered in the left side of the subject, just under the armpit. The claw marks extended to the bottom of the ribcage. Subject has received traditional first aid and is currently committed to the onsite infirmary.

The subject woke up on a snow covered plain. Subject did not have its backpack on hand at the time of the shift, having been asleep. All that went with it was its bed sheets and pajamas. Subject reports having seen a TV show of how to survive in a cold environment. It attempted to build a crude snow cave using its hands when it was interrupted by a large white bear.

This is the extent of its recollection.

* Request: A proper weapon. Granted. Losing subject to a non-anomalous polar bear would be a waste of foundation resources and an embarrassment. Subject shall receive a knife, sheath and belt. Subject is required to keep these items on its person at all times.

**3G8-14H-9UX**
Retrieval: Re-contained in the kitchen missing left hand and using expletives in an uncontrolled fashion. The subject was returned to the infirmary.

The subject transitioned into a dimension very similar to our own at first glance. The subject was apprehended by Foundation personal in the infirmary and questioned about his small “Canines”. The subject admitted to not knowing what that meant, but quickly worked it out after his interviewer opened its mouth and pointed to a set of large fangs located either side of its Incisors. The interviewer also commented on the subjects' roundish body shape, which was considered unusual and fascinating in this dimension.

Despite these differences, the subject described the creatures who interviewed it as kind. They proceeded to bring the subject a large amount of food. The subject noted a distinct lack of anything green in the meal offered to him. When later told to elaborate by foundation personal he stated, “It was all meat!” After eating the meal, two of the creatures containing the subject in their equivalent of the infirmary escorted him into a small room nearby containing a locket hanging on the opposite wall. They told the subject to remove its cloths and stand in front of the locket. After the subject had done as ordered they opened the locket and exposed it to a green orb for approximately 8 minutes. The subject noted the lack of any scar tissue on his left side and a strong feeling of general well being.

The next day a creature came to him and asked for a small portion of his skin and musculature in order to, “study genetic differences.” To this the subject responded with, “Only if you provide me with another delicious meal!” The creature was visibly excited by this outcome. A small biopsy was conducted on the subjects’ upper right thigh. The subject described this experience as, “painful but totally worth it.” A huge amount of unspecified meat was delivered to the subject upon completion of the biopsy. The subject was then released to explore the facility.

For the next month and a half the creatures continued to supply the subject with mounds of meat and engaging it in amiable conversation. The subject acquired 14kg (30.8lb) of fat during this time. On the 16/4/2015 the subject was escorted to the kitchen equivalent. It was then put on a chopping block and its left hand was removed.

* Request: A replacement hand, granted.


**Addendum 507-3B-00:**  Due to a particularly trying encounter with ███-███, several documents in the archives have been altered, corrupted, or technically-never-existed. Document 507-3B appears to have been affected by this, and is currently being rebuilt using backup files, references, and █████ respectively. Subject matter may occasionally increase, decrease, or undergo modifications  in light of this. //-Dr.// ███
