**Foreword:** Below is an archive of all documented “shifts” undergone by [[[SCP-507]]]. Each of these entries are presented with their contents in the following order:
* Dimensional label (created upon discovery of a “new” reality, for ease of later reference) 
* Retrieval (used for the documentation of any complications or anomalies in the recovery of SCP-507 post-shift)
* Description of reality, and description of any aftereffects caused by visiting said reality.
* Request (listings of any special requests made by 507 upon return, or for noting any ”souvenirs” retrieved from the shift)

**1B7-55E-728**
Retrieval: Uneventful.

Subject arrived in a desert environment, and wandered around for roughly an hour before encountering another human. Said human was wearing a tanned leather overcoat and was described as "completely unshaven." Said man was extremely surprised to find the subject, and demanded that he be followed in order to lead them back to food and shelter.

Subject originally began to follow the man, but intentionally lost contact with him upon noticing that his leather coat contained no seams or stitching. 

* Request: None.

**9E2-66V-7HG5**
Retrieval: Uneventful.

Subject arrived in a forest habitat, with no signs of previous or current industrialization. No further anomalies were perceptible until the subject grew hungry, at which point it discovered that harvesting or eating the plant life would cause them to emit “telepathic screams.” Subject abstained from eating for the first day because of this, but became hungry enough on the second day onward to consume the fauna in spite of the screams.

Testing has shown no biological changes in the subject from this, but subject repeatedly affirms that it “felt horrible” for doing so.

* Request: None specifically, but subject adopted a gelatin and pudding based diet for two and a half weeks after returning from this shift.

**J75-R63-3TF**
Retrieval: Uneventful.

Subject arrived in a dimension with flipped genders. No notable differences besides this were discovered, although subject found issue with the fact that it’s female counterpart “Looks pretty much the same” as the standard version.

* Request: None.

**000-000-000** (Invalid)
Retrieval: Via tracking device. Plainclothes agents found subject sitting in an alleyway at ███████, ███████.

Subject was largely unresponsive upon retrieval, and remained so until the standard questioning phase. When asked where it went this shift, subject answered “Nowhere. I think I missed it this time.”

Subject experienced minor motor skill impairment and decreased activity levels for roughly a month after this shift.

* Request: A nightlight, and a wristwatch which makes an audible “tick” as the second hand moves. Both were approved.

**J7Q-53Y-8ST**
Retrieval: Subject was found in it’s quarters, sprawled on the floor, attempting to gnaw through the “sleeves” of a straightjacket it was wearing. The jacket, leg restraints, and the loss of motor skills still present from the last shift led to the subject being unable to stand up or open the door to find assistance.

Subject shifted while sleeping, and awoke restrained and lying in a hospital-grade bed. A nurse informed the subject that he was still a patient at the ████ ██ asylum, and was currently suffering from advanced stages of dementia. Subject was then sedated, and spent the rest of this shift alternating between sub-consciousness and total unconsciousness.

* Request: Disregarding “Get this […] thing off me,” none.

**9E2-66V-7HG5-2**
Retrieval: Subject found in it’s quarters, balled up with it’s hands over it’s ears.

Subject once again arrived in the forest habitat from 9E2-66V-7HG5. The fauna seemed to have remembered subject’s last visit, though, and they reacted by “screaming” for it’s entire four day shift.

* Request: A hug. Approved.

**6K3-21B-I0S**
[EXPUNGED]

**BN2-AL6-CTE**
Retrieval: Uneventful.

Subject arrived in an derelict metropolitan area. Subject was unable to locate any other humans, but noted an overabundance of cats in every area it visited. Said felines seemed no different from normal housecats, though, and subject spent most of this shift petting any who came near.

During the standard examination procedures after retrieval trace amounts of a Toxoplasma gondii variant were discovered on the subject’s clothing, as well as larger amounts on it’s shoes. Further testing showed that subject had not yet been infected with the Toxoplasmosis variant; most likely attributed to the short timeframe of this shift not allowing the subject to grow hungry and seek out food.

All clothing and belongings that were on subject's person during this shift were incinerated, and the subject forced to undergo special decontamination procedures, in order to prevent any possibity of contagion.

* Request: a pair of rubber gloves. Denied, on the basis that hand protection would not have prevented subject from infection in any way.

**125-28P-OS4-3**
Retrieval: Via tracking device. Subject was attempting to return on it’s own, but was making less progress than usual due to the uncomfort of doing so.

Subject once again arrived in a pitch-black area, with muted breathing nearby. Subject decided to seek an exit this time via blind wandering. Subject eventually found itself at the mouth of a corridor with what appeared to be a light source at the end. Subject began to run towards the light upon noticing this.

As it grew closer, the light suddenly grew in intensity and the subject was exposed to “searing pain.” Subject passed out at this point, and only awoke after it had shifted back.

Examination upon retrieval revealed that the subject’s epidermis had been cleanly stripped down to the stratum granulose in all areas open to sunlight, and down to the stratum lucidum in all areas covered by clothing.

* Request: None, but subject reappeared wearing a pair of large, heavily tinted sunglasses. Subject did not notice that it was wearing these until they were pointed out, and supposed that they were probably why it’s eyes did not undergo the same process as it’s skin.

**7F2-WA3-193**
Retrieval: Uneventful.

Subject arrived in an urban area, with no major changes as far as it could tell. Subject used the public computers of a library to search for differences between this dimension and ours; eventually finding that Abraham Lincoln was assassinated by his Vice President in order to claim his position. This ultimately led to the Presidency becoming a “tribe-leader-like” position, where the current holder is legally allowed to be challenged and overthrown by other suitable candidates.

Subject noted, with great surprise, that this change did not do much to alter the times that most “major” presidents took and held the office. Many of the minor and/or detrimental presidencies tended to end via bullet wounds, often in unlikely locales or from improbable angles, which deterred most from attempting coups at all.

* Request: None.

**WS6-ECU-83D**
Retrieval: Uneventful.

Subject arrived the mouth of a cave, surrounded by “almost unbearable” heat. Subject walked outside the cave for further investigation, to find that the area around it was a baked wasteland. Most of the heat appeared to emanate from two suns in the sky, which the subject could not decide on whether they were extremely large or extremely close to the planet.

Upon further examination the “suns” blinked and turned away; taking the heat with them.

Subject spent rest of this shift as far back in the cave as possible.

* Request: None.

**AS6-43K-0P4**
Retrieval: Uneventful

Subject found itself in what appeared to be limousine driving through a foggy landscape, seated across from an elderly hunchbacked man and a much younger woman. The hunchbacked man exibited surprise at subject's sudden appearance. After a few minutes of sitting around in awkward silence, the elderly man offered a tarot reading to SCP-507, using a Horse-shoe spread. The results were as follows:

Card 1 (Past): Five of Cups (Represents sorrow, tragedy)
Card 2 (Present): Death (Represents transition, being caught up in the inescapable)
Card 3 (influences): The Devil (Represents futility, doubt)
Card 4 (Obsticals): The Hanged Man (Represents sacrifice, contemplation.)
Card 5 (Expectations): Wheel of Fortune (Represents opportunity)
Card 6 (Best Course of Action): The Fool (Represents experience, or a journey)
Card 7 (Likely Outcomes): Temperance (Represents harmony, balance)

* Request: A journal, and a book on meditation. Both approved.


**Addendum 507-3B-00:**  Due to a particularly trying encounter with ███-███, several documents in the archives have been altered, corrupted, or technically-never-existed. Document 507-3B appears to have been affected by this, and is currently being rebuilt using backup files, references, and █████ respectively. Subject matter may occasionally increase, decrease, or undergo modifications  in lieu of this. //-Dr.//███
