**Foreword:** Below is an archive of all documented "shifts" undergone by [[[SCP-507]]]. Each of these entries is presented with their contents in the following order:
* Dimensional label (created upon discovery of a "new" reality, for ease of later reference) 
* Retrieval (used for the documentation of any complications or anomalies in the recovery of SCP-507 post-shift)
* Description of reality, and description of any aftereffects caused by visiting said reality.
* Request (listings of any special requests made by 507 upon return, or for noting any "souvenirs" retrieved from the shift)

For easy note, this is a list of equipment thus far: 1x handgun, loaded with rubber bullets. Only one magazine which is carried in the gun. 1x knife, sheath, and belt. 1x tank of air. 1x high intensity flashlight. A few ration packs. A waterproofed set of binoculars. A tracking collar. 1x camera.

**1B7-55E-728**
Retrieval: Uneventful.

Subject arrived in a desert environment, and wandered around for roughly an hour before encountering another human. Said human was wearing a tanned leather overcoat and was described as "completely unshaven." Said man was extremely surprised to find the subject, and demanded that he be followed in order to lead it back to food and shelter.

Subject originally began to follow the man, but intentionally lost contact with him upon noticing that his leather coat contained no seams or stitching. 

* Request: None.

**9E2-66V-7HG5**
Retrieval: Uneventful.

Subject arrived in a forest habitat, with no signs of previous or current industrialization. No further anomalies were perceptible until the subject grew hungry, at which point it discovered that harvesting or eating the plant life would cause them to emit "telepathic screams." Subject abstained from eating for the first day because of this, but became hungry enough on the second day onward to consume the flora in spite of the screams.

Testing has shown no biological changes in the subject from this, but subject repeatedly affirms that it "felt horrible" for doing so.

* Request: None specifically, but subject adopted a gelatin- and pudding-based diet for two and a half weeks after returning from this shift.

**J75-R63-3TF**
Retrieval: Uneventful.

Subject arrived in a dimension with flipped genders. No notable differences besides this were discovered, although subject found issue with the fact that its female counterpart "looks pretty much the same" as the standard version.

* Request: None.

**000-000-000** (Invalid)
Retrieval: Via tracking device. Plainclothes agents found subject sitting in an alleyway at ███████, ███████.

Subject was largely unresponsive upon retrieval, and remained so until the standard questioning phase. When asked where it went this shift, subject answered, “Nowhere. I think I missed it this time.”

Subject experienced minor motor skill impairment and decreased activity levels for roughly a month after this shift.

* Request: A nightlight, and a wristwatch which makes an audible "tick" as the second hand moves. Both were approved.

**J7Q-53Y-8ST**
Retrieval: Subject was found in its quarters, sprawled on the floor, attempting to gnaw through the "sleeves" of a straitjacket it was wearing. The jacket, leg restraints, and the loss of motor skills still present from the last shift led to the subject being unable to stand up or open the door to find assistance.

Subject shifted while sleeping, and awoke restrained and lying in a hospital-grade bed. A nurse informed the subject that he was still a patient at the ████ ██ asylum, and was currently suffering from advanced stages of dementia. Subject was then sedated, and spent the rest of this shift alternating between semi-consciousness and total unconsciousness.

* Request: Disregarding "Get this [EXPLETIVE] thing off me," none.

**9E2-66V-7HG5-2**
Retrieval: Subject found in its quarters, balled up with its hands over its ears.

Subject once again arrived in the forest habitat from 9E2-66V-7HG5. The flora seemed to have remembered subject's last visit, though, and they reacted by "screaming" for its entire four-day shift.

* Request: A hug. Approved.

**6K3-21B-I0S**
[DATA EXPUNGED] under the direct order of the O5 Council. Level 5 clearance required.

**BN2-AL6-CTE**
Retrieval: Uneventful.

Subject arrived in a derelict metropolitan area. Subject was unable to locate any other humans, but noted an overabundance of cats in every area it visited. Said felines seemed no different from normal housecats, though, and subject spent most of this shift petting any who came near.

During the standard examination procedures after retrieval, trace amounts of a Toxoplasma gondii variant were discovered on the subject’s clothing, as well as larger amounts on its shoes. Further testing showed that subject had not yet been infected with the Toxoplasmosis variant, most likely attributed to the short timeframe of this shift not allowing the subject to grow hungry and seek out food.

All clothing and belongings that were on subject's person during this shift were incinerated, and the subject forced to undergo special decontamination procedures, in order to prevent any possibility of contagion.

* Request: a pair of rubber gloves. Denied, on the basis that hand protection would not have protected subject from infection in any way.

**125-28P-OS4-3**
Retrieval: Via tracking device. Subject was attempting to return on its own, but was making less progress than usual due to the discomfort of doing so.

Subject once again arrived in a pitch-black area, with muted breathing nearby. Subject decided to seek an exit this time via blind wandering. Subject eventually found itself at the mouth of a corridor with what appeared to be a light source at the end. Subject began to run towards the light upon noticing this.

As it grew closer, the light suddenly grew in intensity and the subject was exposed to "searing pain." Subject passed out at this point, and only awoke after it had shifted back.

Examination upon retrieval revealed that the subject's epidermis had been cleanly stripped down to the stratum granulosum in all areas open to sunlight, and down to the stratum lucidum in all areas covered by clothing.

* Request: None, but subject reappeared wearing a pair of large, heavily tinted sunglasses. Subject did not notice that it was wearing these until they were pointed out, and supposed that they were probably why its eyes did not undergo the same process as its skin.

**7F2-WA3-193**
Retrieval: Uneventful.

Subject arrived in an urban area, with no major changes as far as it could tell. Subject used the public computers of a library to search for differences between this dimension and ours, eventually finding that Abraham Lincoln was assassinated by his Vice President in order to claim his position. This ultimately led to the Presidency becoming a "tribe-leader-like" position, where the current holder is legally allowed to be challenged and overthrown by other suitable candidates.

Subject noted, with great surprise, that this change did not do much to alter the times that most "major" presidents took and held the office. Many of the minor and/or detrimental presidencies tended to end via bullet wounds, often in unlikely locales or from improbable angles, which deterred most from attempting coups at all.

* Request: None.

**WS6-ECU-83D**
Retrieval: Uneventful.

Subject arrived at the mouth of a cave, surrounded by "almost unbearable" heat. Subject walked outside the cave for further investigation, to find that the area around it was a baked wasteland. Most of the heat appeared to emanate from two suns in the sky; the subject could not decide whether they were extremely large or extremely close to the planet.

Upon further examination, the "suns" blinked and turned away, taking the heat with them.

Subject spent the rest of this shift as far back in the cave as possible.

* Request: None.

**Q56-DRU-865**
Retrieval: Subject found in the cafeteria, masticating on what appeared to be [REDACTED].

Upon containment of [REDACTED], Subject uttered the words, "More! More! More!" before losing consciousness.

Subject regained consciousness 2 hours later, expressing a strong desire for pudding. When questioned, Subject claimed to see "the biggest mound of pudding ever". When questioned as to why it was masticating on [REDACTED] upon arrival, subject claimed to be eating a "glob a pudding" at the time. 

Subject reported seeing [REDACTED] rolling around the hallways. Hallucinations passed within 24 hours.

* Request: Pudding. Request granted.

**F24-9S6-33C**
Retrieval: Subject found in Service Tunnel 6r3bk without original equipment. Subject was wearing a simple uniform with a similar design to the current Foundation D-class uniform.

Subject shifted while dining in the cafeteria. Destination dimension had an analogue to the Foundation with a facility in the same location, although internal layout had significant differences. Security responded to subject as an intruder and detained it immediately. During this process, the subject was imprisoned and stripped of all equipment, including the tracking device. For the remainder of the shift, subject underwent repeated questioning, the Foundation analogue refused to accept subject's explanation of dimension hopping.

Information gleaned from post-shift debriefing indicates that F24-9S6-33C has a Foundation analogue in the Society for Containment of the Paranormal. This analogue has a strong British influence, and is opposed by the Covert Occult Group and Church of the Mending God. Further details remain unclear as the Society refused to answer the subject's questions and only slipped details by assuming it knew them already.

* Request: Replacement equipment. Request granted.

**4GT-F1Q-H17**
Retrieval: Subject was found by the cafeteria kitchen staff of site-██, drenched, covered in mud, and suffering from severe hypothermia.

Subject arrived in what appeared to be a large field during a rainstorm. Subject attempted to find shelter from the rain, but found none, remaining in the rain for the entire shift. After an unknown length of time, the subject reported seeing entities in the distance. Although the heavy rain obscured the subject from obtaining a detailed report of their appearances, the subject described them as being vaguely humanoid in shape. The entities began to slowly move towards the subject from all directions. Near the end of the shift, the subject reported hearing labored breathing from the nearest entities.

* Requests: a set of warm clothing. Approved.

**2AW-9U2-E5T**
Retrieval: Uneventful.

Subject arrived in midair, falling from an outdoor environment into a subterranean body of water at the bottom of a large cavern. Though admittedly experiencing a strong surge of adrenaline from this event, subject reported swimming "a long way" before reaching land. Subsequent observation revealed a giant hole in the ceiling of the cavern, through which subject had apparently fallen. Also reported were archways to other large caverns, most with shafts of sunlight visible indicating other surface collapses. Regular vertical grooves in the walls indicate possible excavation, despite the caverns' immense size. No other sign of life was observed.

Before returning, subject realized that the possibility of shifting back to our reality so far underground might cause it to be displaced in solid rock, and spent its remaining time frantically searching for a way back to the surface. When subject succeeded, it discovered that the sinkholes were much more widespread than what had been visible from below ground.
* Request: Diving Lessons. Denied.

**2UU-5I9-Q3D**
Retrieval: Upon seeing Foundation personnel in ████████, ████, subject approached them and requested to be recontained, showing knowledge of SCPs that were of Level 3 clearance.

The length of time the subject was absent from our reality was notable, being roughly three months in length. However, during this time, it made several notable discoveries, including several SCPs uncontained by our reality's SCP Foundation but contained by Universe 2UU-5I9-Q3D's equivalent. These SCPs have now been contained.

Through this three-month time frame, the subject managed to become a member of 2UU-5I9-Q3D's SCP Foundation equivalent, working its way up the ranks far faster than would have been anticipated assuming it had been made a member of Foundation personnel on the same day. At the time of its return, he was apparently in the field, working to contain 2UU-5I9-Q3D's equivalent of SCP-███. Curiously, our Foundation had sent out a Task Force for precisely the same reason, on the same day. Further links between Universe 2UU-5I9-Q3D and our reality are being investigated.

* Request: To be made a member of Site personnel. Denied.

**3JT-3MD-DIG**
Retrieval:  Subject retrieved via implanted tracker; medevac required to Site ██

Subject was immobile upon retrieval due to greatly increased body mass, measured at ███ kg. Lead Researcher ██████ approved emergency use of [[[SCP-394]]] to keep it alive in order to obtain a report.

Upon recovery, subject reported being surrounded by "really [EXPLETIVE] big" creatures resembling ██████████. They quickly trapped him in a transparent container. It was then transported an unknown distance to a shiny surface, whereupon the creatures began to observe him. After approximately one day tubes were inserted into [DATA EXPUNGED] unknown fluid which was not found upon examination.

Subject reported that the tubes were removed shortly before the shift and it observed [REDACTED] approaching it, presumably for the purpose of extraction.

* Request: Services of a personal trainer. Dr. ████████ has agreed to let the subject borrow her workout tapes. Subject now displays a strong aversion to pudding.

**9J3-Y6X-GTY**

Retrieval: The subject was found hanging from its ankles in a tree on-site. Subject was partially encased in insulated, reflective titanium armor upon retrieval.

The subject described the world it had arrived in as "extra shiny" and stated that it was apprehended by law enforcement officers upon arrival. After being apprehended, the subject was transported to a nearby manufacturing facility and placed upside down on an assembly line where a series of metal sheets were shaped and cut to fit its body. It briefly had time to ask what was going on and was informed that the radiation from the sun was extremely dangerous and titanium reflective suits were required by law to prevent thermal radiation damage to any person or structure.
 
* Request: Sun-screen and an eye exam. Granted.

**52J-O79-3GH**
Retrieval: Via tracking device. Subject was found inside a padlocked metal shed, behind an abandoned house on the outskirts of ███████, ██.

Subject arrived in a small room housing several dried corpses. Besides said corpses, the room was mostly bare; the only things subject noted were a single paneless window and a light fixture on the ceiling which occasionally flickered. Subject attempted to rise to his feet, but had difficulty doing so due to repeated and unpredictable surges of motion.

Subject eventually made its way to the window, at which point it discovered that its "room" was actually a container suspended in midair by a large chain. Subject watched as similar containers passed by him, and as it passed by others, via a complex web of rails above it which the chains were attached to. Subject could see nothing besides this but darkness in all directions.

Subject then tried to "wait out" its time in this dimension by falling asleep, but found it difficult due to a newly discovered quality of the corpses. During moments of darkness caused by flickering, the corpses rearranged themselves into poses which would be logical for living people during that particular moment. If the subject was looking out the window the corpses would be crowded around him in an attempt to get a better view, if the subject was sitting they would also be seated in a pattern to form a full circle, if the subject attempted to reach the light fixture they would act as a support/seem to be in the process of pushing him upwards, etc.

* Request: None. The area which the subject exited, though, has been cordoned off and is currently under surveillance. If no evidence of Foundation-worthy phenomena has been experienced by ██/██/██, an anonymous tip will be sent to local law enforcement agencies so that they can "discover" the crime scene and take appropriate investigative actions on their own.

**YTF-5N2-Q00**
Retrieval: Uneventful

Subject arrived in a crowded casino-like area. Subject noted that the only type of machine available was something similar to slots, but they apparently required no money to play and gave out nothing upon a "win."

Upon actually sitting down in front of one and trying it, the subject discovered that the machine dispensed a small slip of paper with writing on it upon every pull of the lever and spin of the symbols it displayed. Subject could discern no real pattern to what symbol would produce what type of note, but wrote down a list of its attempts and what it received from each just in case.

[[code]]Jewel/Crescent/Claw: "If given a slice of death, could you tell how large it was?"

Hammer/Crescent/Crescent: "A poor base leads to rushed patch-jobs."

Crescent/Hammer/Jewel: "Déjà who?"

Claw/Circle/Hammer: "There are things worse than death. For one: Not dying."

Crescent/Hammer/Crescent: "There will always be someone to look after you."

Crescent/Jewel/Crescent: "They’re not that jolly; it’s just stuck that way."

Hammer/Crescent/Hammer: "There will always be something to look after."

Claw/Claw/Claw: "The future's looking bright."[[/code]]

* Request: None.

**FN3-05P-KHC**
Retrieval: Uneventful.

Subject appeared in a white corridor, with steel doors lining both walls. Each door had a keypad, a small speaker system, and a clipboard containing forms written in undecipherable characters.

As the subject approached one door to examine said clipboard, the door’s attached speaker turned on and began to address it. Subject was informed that the voice belonged to the person locked behind that specific door, and that he was wrongfully imprisoned, then left to die. The prisoner then pleaded with the subject to release him from his cell.

Subject, jokingly, replied that he would free the prisoner if he promised not to stab the subject upon release. There was roughly a seven second pause before the prisoner asked what “stabbing” was. After a moment of deliberation, the subject defined stabbing as “The creation of a new orifice through the use of a pointed object.”

Another pause followed. The prisoner eventually affirmed that he could not stab the subject, because all of his objects were “very blunt.”

Subject, naturally, did not open that door or any of the others.

* Request: None.

**I52-37G-Z8M**
Retrieval: Via tracking device. Subject was in a holding cell of the ███ █████ police station, under charges of public indecency. Extraction was successfully made with no complications.

Subject arrived in an area apparently undergoing a large snowstorm. Subject attempted to find shelter but could not find its way in the storm, and had almost succumbed to exposure by the time it was located and pulled into a cave by a man covered in protective furs.

The man helped the subject out of its soaked clothing; although he did not have an extra set of garments, he led the subject to an underground hot spring his cave was connected to. When the man was sure that the subject was regaining its strength, he removed his furs and entered the spring as well.

Subject was extremely surprised to discover that the man was a second SCP-507. Subject noticed no obvious physical differences between itself and the double, although the alternate-507 had a pattern of "tribal scarring" across his torso, as well as at the bases of some of his limbs. Subject and the double remained in the cave and conversed with each other until the subject’s shift ended.

* Request: Subject drew a replica of the alternate-507's scars from memory, and asked for any information on possible cultural or symbolic meaning behind the patterns. None was found, but Foundation researchers noted that the lines were congruent with incision marks which would be made during a standard [REDACTED].

**S43-51U-P09**
Retrieval: Via tracking device. Subject recovered in a cornfield in ██████, █████████, with unidentified brown liquid splattered on its cheek. A human heart with the words "I NEED YOU" written with the same liquid was discovered in subject's hand. Subject claimed that said object was not in its possession during the shift and does not know how it came into its possession. Researchers are attempting to identify the liquid.

Subject arrived in pitch black darkness, with the sound of crying nearby. Upon activating its flashlight, subject discovered the "Smiling Man" from previous shifts leaning towards him. Brown liquid leaked from around its sunglasses. Smiling Man pushed its face closer to subject's and uttered the phrase, "Why did you do this?" Smiling Man then wiped off a portion of the brown liquid from its eyes with its hand and began caressing subject's cheek with it.

Subject forcefully pushed Smiling Man away. Subject observed that the Smiling Man's business suit contained several holes, with brown liquid trailing down from them. Subject drew its firearm and pulled the trigger; however, for unknown reasons, the pistol did not fire. Smiling Man began slowly walking towards subject. Subject ran for approximately 10 minutes and spent the rest of the shift huddled in a corner.

* Request: A more reliable pistol. Denied, as the cause of the error is unknown. 

**9E2-66V-7HG5-3**
Retrieval: Via tracking device. Subject was discovered 7km (4.3 miles) North-East of the facility.

Subject shifted while reading in its quarters. Subject found itself returned to the forest habitat containing telepathic trees. The trees remained silent upon its entry to the environment. The subject admitted that despite its previous experiences within the environment, it was curious about the absence of any human habitation. The subject propelled itself to the highest ground it could find in order to see over the tree canopy.

The subject found a clearing on the top of a hill. Subject reported seeing a huge semi-translucent blue dome covering the entire forest. The tree canopy extended out to the edge of the dome with foliage so thick that looking up and through it was unfeasible. Subject reported itself to see the dome slightly off-center, suggesting it was not underneath the direct middle.

* Request: None.

**5Z4-75T-7YB**
Retrieval: Subject was found prone and unresponsive in its quarters. Subject was bleeding significantly. Several deep gashes were discovered in the left side of the subject, just under the armpit. The claw marks extended to the bottom of the ribcage. Subject received traditional first aid and was committed to the onsite infirmary.

The subject woke up on a snow-covered plain. Subject did not have its backpack on hand at the time of the shift, having been asleep. All that went with it was its bed sheets and pajamas. Subject reports having seen a TV show of how to survive in a cold environment before the shift. It attempted to build a crude snow cave using its hands when it was interrupted by a large white bear.

This is the extent of its recollection.

* Request: A proper weapon. Granted. Losing subject to a non-anomalous polar bear would be a waste of Foundation resources and an embarrassment. Subject shall receive a knife, sheath, and belt and is required to keep these items on its person at all times.

**3G8-14H-9UX**
Retrieval: Re-contained in the kitchen missing left hand and using expletives in an uncontrolled fashion. The subject was returned to the infirmary.

The subject transitioned into a dimension very similar to our own at first glance. The subject was apprehended by Foundation personnel in the infirmary and questioned about his small "canines." The subject admitted to not knowing what that meant, but quickly worked it out after his interviewer opened its mouth and pointed to a set of large fangs located either side of its incisors. The interviewer also commented on the subject's roundish body shape, which was considered unusual and fascinating in this dimension.

Despite these differences, the subject described the creatures who interviewed it as kind. They proceeded to bring the subject a large amount of food. The subject noted a distinct lack of anything green in the meal offered to him. When later told to elaborate by Foundation personnel, he stated, "It was all meat!" After eating the meal, two of the creatures containing the subject in their equivalent of the infirmary escorted him into a small room nearby containing a locket hanging on the opposite wall. They told the subject to remove its clothes and stand in front of the locket. After the subject had done as ordered they opened the locket and exposed it to a green orb for approximately 8 minutes. The subject noted the lack of any scar tissue on his left side and a strong feeling of general well being.

The next day a creature came to him and asked for a small portion of his skin and musculature in order to "study genetic differences." To this, the subject responded with, "Only if you provide me with another delicious meal!" The creature was visibly excited by this outcome. A small biopsy was conducted on the subject's upper right thigh. The subject described this experience as "painful but totally worth it." A huge amount of unspecified meat was delivered to the subject upon completion of the biopsy. The subject was then released to explore the facility.

For the next month and a half, the creatures continued to supply the subject with mounds of meat and engage it in amiable conversation. The subject acquired 14kg (30.8lb) of fat during this time. On 16/4/2015 the subject was escorted to the kitchen equivalent. It was then put on a chopping block and its left hand was removed.

* Request: A replacement hand. Granted.

**8A8-91T-710**
Retrieval: Uneventful.

Subject arrived in a large, opaque dome filled with plants, without any signs of human habitation. Subject stated that walking was difficult and uncomfortable. Upon further investigation, the subject found a window, displaying what was described as "pitch black, with Earth on the horizon."

Several minutes later, a tall humanoid encountered the subject, inquiring about his comparative short stature. Subject replied, asking where he was. The humanoid stated they were in "Base 12, oxygen and vegetable wing". Subject asked what Earth was doing in the sky; humanoid appeared puzzled and responded, "That is the moon," gesturing to Earth. A short argument ensued and the humanoid departed.

Subject noted that after the Earth "set," a rocky grey landscape became visible, becoming identifiable as the lunar surface after "an hour or so". Subject attempted to explore more of his surroundings, but shifted back to our reality shortly after setting out.

* Request: One camera; subject stated: "the view was breathtaking". Denied.

**7J0-175-35X**
Retrieval: Subject was re-contained on the roof of the facility, after having fallen approximately five meters.

Subject shifted while attempting to fall asleep. Subject arrived in a large body of water, believed to be freshwater by the description of its taste. Subject swam upward an estimated thirty-five meters before reaching the surface of the water and beginning to tread. Subject noted several dark shapes moving in the water beneath it and bright lights in the distance, but did not attempt to approach either. Subject reportedly found breathing extremely difficult. Subsequent physical tests indicated that the subject had ingested substantial amounts of methane during the shift.

* Request: A tank of breathing gas as part of its equipment. Approved.

**99P-UT1-24J**
Retrieval: Subject was found in the location in which it had left, curled up and crying violently. Subject screamed "Why did I have to go?!" when an attempt was made to interact with it, and suffered from severe depression for several days thereafter. Agents described a "beautiful" smell coming from it.

Subject landed in a place it could only describe as "impossibly beautiful". Subject stated that it was "like the best parts of every place all put together", and that the beauty was so overwhelming that Subject had no desire to move. When it began to become thirsty and hungry, plants apparently extended vines and shot a liquid into its mouth which it described as "the best anything I have ever drunk ever -- sweet and rich and everything all at once". After roughly one day (subject, having never looked at his watch during this time, had no clear knowledge of the duration) a humanoid female close to subject's age unexpectedly encountered subject as she walked over a hill. Subject claimed that they had a "long conversation", despite not speaking the same language, and was unable to explain how this was possible or the form their communication had taken. Subject claimed that he understood her answers to his questions about her and their location, but was unable to articulate them. Subject described her with: "I know I'm sounding repetitive here, but she was the most amazing person I've ever met". With some reluctance, subject stated that they had been about to kiss when the shift ended. Subject then had to be prevented from committing suicide. Tests after successful psychiatric treatment indicated subject was considerably more physically fit and had gained roughly 8 IQ points, despite having done no significant exercise during the shift.

* Request: Various foods, beverages, and pictures of women widely regarded as very physically attractive. The subject considered all granted requests unsatisfactory, making statements such as "it's not the same," and "no, no, not like //that//!" Subject then requested a way to stay in a universe permanently after having arrived there, and was reminded that that was impossible.

**6A5-93W-132**
Retrieval: Subject returned malnourished and suffering from the effects of an unknown toxic substance, from which it soon recovered. Later analysis showed the substance to be a venom containing a high level of silicon. A small silicon-based crystalline creature was hanging from the subject's finger when the subject returned. This specimen subsequently died of unknown causes, possibly starvation.

Subject shifted to a dimension which primarily contained crystals of varying sizes and hues. The sun was described by the subject as "smaller and bluer than ours." The ground was covered in sand, also of various dull colors. The subject noted that many of the larger crystals were moving slowly and appeared to be alive. It also saw smaller creatures which scuttled around quite rapidly, and seemed to be composed of crystal. The subject spent some time searching for water, which it found. It noted that there seemed to be considerably more of the smaller crystalline animals near the water. Shortly before the subject returned, it was attacked by one of the small creatures.

The subject described both the larger and smaller creatures as both looking and behaving similarly to crustaceans.

* Request: Food and water "that doesn't taste like sand." Granted.

**7XJ-HG5-77B**
Retrieval: Subject reappeared in its quarters, highly agitated. D-3762 and the handcuffs binding the two together were reported missing.

Subject, before the shift, was handcuffed to D-3762, a convicted serial killer. Subject was instructed to terminate D-3762 if either of them were placed in mortal danger.

507 shifted to a dimension where a second ice age was occurring on Earth. Immediately after landing, D-3762 and the subject were captured by agents of a post-apocalyptic SCP Foundation. The former was immediately recognized as a D-Class and was swiftly terminated by an individual claiming to be Agent ███. 507 was placed in a cell in the lower levels of a facility called Site ██. Subject recalls that from the interrogation, the agents believed that it was a junior researcher attempting to help D-3762 escape from the Foundation. During the interrogation, the subject shifted back into our dimension.

* Request: Replacement gear. Granted.

**T34-DE2-04F**
Retrieval: Subject was found in Sector █-█, a highly restricted area. Subject was swiftly removed.

Subject shifted to a dimension with a world covered in water[[footnote]]Claimed to be saltwater[[/footnote]], Subject then equipped its scuba gear and decided to see what was below the water. Subject descended for approximately 3 minutes and believed it had traveled 50 meters down before seeing the ocean floor. The floor was covered with abandoned buildings and rubble, corroded and covered with aqueous plant life; several skeletons could be seen. Subject had searched the underwater city for 3 minutes when the Subject spotted 3 black, fish-like creatures moving towards it at an estimated speed of 10 meters per second. Subject drew his knife and firearm before shifting back into our dimension.

* Request: A pair of waterproof binoculars. Approved.

**A60-D99-75Q**
Retrieval: Subject returned to the site, wearing an elaborate costume made of silks, wool and several unidentified mammals.

Subject appeared in an empty alleyway of a "futuristic" city inhabited by a large variety of unknown humanoid entities. When subject encountered said entities they appeared startled at its presence and began vocalizing loudly and seemed to become agitated.  Eventually, the equivalent of local authorities took the subject into custody and were able to communicate with it. When questioned about how he arrived there subject stated it had "amnesia" and could not recall the last several years. Subject then questioned the origin of the various beings and the reason for their presence on Earth. Said authorities explained to the subject that after the Earth suffered a CK-Class End of the World Scenario (based on the description given it is hypothesized that the event was caused by SCP-███) the Earth, left with a greatly reduced human population, was subsequently colonized by various extraterrestrial races. The few remaining humans on the planet mostly inhabited isolated areas away from the alien cities. These authorities then offered to take the subject to the nearest of these locations, but subject refused, insisting that it stay among the extraterrestrials. It appears the subject's status as one of the few remaining humans comfortable with the presence of the aliens, combined with a large number of facts that it fabricated about life on earth prior to the CK-Class Scenario allowed the subject to gain a high social profile as part of the alien society, becoming something of a celebrity during the 2 weeks its spent in shift.    

* Request: A camera to better record and document events and sights experienced during shifts. Approved.

**Z73-3DD-89E**
Retrieval: Subject was found in the basement of a house in █████, ███████.

Subject arrived in an airship of some sort, flying across what appeared to be a mountainous region. Subject reported meeting several humanoids it described as dwarves and elves, similar to those found in typical high fantasy literature. These beings were supposedly mercenaries investigating an anomaly in their world, described as a dragon having fallen from the sky. Subject requested to join them in their mission, getting excited to partake in an apparently fantastical adventure. 
After landing at the site of the mission, subject was reluctantly convinced to stay on the airship, as the mission would likely be dangerous. Eventually getting impatient, subject investigated the cave in which the supposed dragon hid on its own, managing to take a picture of a massive, reptilian creature with metallic scales and wings with its camera just as it shifted back. The picture is described by Foundation staff as 'sick as [EXPLETIVE]'.
Subject repeatedly affirmed that a child wearing a large, pointed hat appeared just before the shift and grabbed its leg.

* Request: A Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition Player's Handbook. Granted.

Retrieval: Uneventful

Subject appeared in the bedroom of a “cute little suburban lookin’ house” and was greeted by several people of varying age and race. They welcomed him to their home and showed him around the building. Subject noted an abundance of windows in the building. Upon looking outside, noticed that the house was encased in a large glass dome and was being viewed by several cameras. The residents explained that they were part of a zoo-like enclosure. Subject was not distressed, as he knew he would eventually return to the Foundation. Subject spent the next several days meeting the residents and relaxing while waiting to return.

**DRK-038-891**
Retrieval: SCP-507 was found in Dr. King's office.

Subject appeared in what seemed to be an endless forest of apple trees.  It was inhabited by a race of humanoids, all of whom appeared identical to Dr. King.  The entities seemed to recognize SCP-507, and gave him a message to pass on to Dr. King:

> 
> Come home, lost child.  We have sent you the signs countless times, yet still, you do not come.  Do you not remember the holy orchard of your birth?  The wind through the trees, the crisp delight of Her Holy Fruit?  Please come home.
> We miss you.
>

* Request:  To pass the message on to Dr. King.  Denied, for the safety of SCP-507.

**SCP-LD9-431**
Retrival: Uneventful

Subject appeared in a highly furnished version of its containment chamber. After leaving the chamber it discovered that the facility was inverted from the main reality in the sense that all of the offices were replaced with containment chambers and vice versa. Further inquiry revealed that foundation staff were being contained due to their ability to create dangerous experiments. The primary containment staff consisted of more docile versions of the baseline reality's humanoids in containment. Notably less hostility did not make their lack of containment any safer causing the facility to be filled with biological memetic and other hazards. It is unknown how a K-class scenario has not occurred despite the apparent lack of containment. D-class and non-research staff were unchanged.

* Request: Heightened psychological evaluations on staff. [REDACTED].

//I swear you guys aren't telling us something about 507. It didn't bring __anything__ dangerous back somehow and never does. Not to mention it was in a mental institution and aspires to be a researcher.  - Agent McDaniels//

**RED-B9R-AVO**
Retrieval: Subject was found in its quarters, in a catatonic state of depression. Subject was exposed to SCP-999 and all mental issues have been reverted.

Subject appeared dressed in a full dive suit in a large crowd of people, who did not seem to notice his appearance. Equipment bag was taken during a security check. Subject followed the crowd until eventually directed onto a large boat with several tanks and large amounts of dive masks and snorkels. When driven out, subject noticed the water was colored red. A diver was seen verbally protesting against a security officer, at which point he was terminated via gunshots and thrown into the water. Subject decided not to inquire about his whereabouts due to the apparently brutal ways the guards dealt with the non ordinary. Subject soon went on a diving expedition, and managed to follow through most of the dive. The crowd of divers soon met with what was described to be almost identical to SCP-3000. Subject underwent actions common with the memetic cognitohazards SCP-3000 presents. At this point subject returned to reality, and all memetic hazards had disappeared.

* Request: Termination. Denied.

**SPC-268-110**
Retrieval: Subject was found in quarters, equipment and clothing damaged and covered in blood, missing his left index finger.

Subject appeared in an alternate Foundation Site with the site's alarms activated. As soon as the subject looked up, he was immediately made aware that he had appeared directly beneath SCP-682 during a containment breach. Subject remained motionless until SCP-682's tail brushed past him by chance. SCP-682 immediately attacked, removing the subject's index finger and creating several deep lacerations across its body before an MTF unit engaged SCP-682. This provided the subject an opportunity to escape, running towards the nearest medical bay to stabilise its condition. Foundation staff located the subject 27 hours later after SCP-682 had been re-contained. Foundation personnel helped stabilise the subject's condition before escorting it to its chambers.

* Request: A new finger. Granted.

//Jesus Christ, I can't imagine what he must have gone through in there, all the more reason to destroy that damned lizard as soon as possible. -Dr. J Evans//

**JPL-114-904**
Retrieval: Via tracking device. Subject was discovered in a department store in █████,█████. Subject was covered in burns, and its clothes were singed. 

Subject found itself in a burning building. Subject immediately attempted to escape only to find all exits blocked or consumed in flame. Subject wedged open a window in an attempt to jump. Upon looking out the window, Subject noticed there was a large crowd of humanoids staring silently up at the building. Each was dressed in a long robe, and was wearing an ornate mask. Several of them were holding torches. One of the humanoids held up a sign, which Subject described as saying "He has found you guilty of sin, and He will see you punished." Facing no other choice, Subject jumped from the window and shifted mid jump. 

* Request: Burn cream and a book on cults. Granted. 

**WQK-112-994**
Retrieval: Uneventful

Subject appeared in the middle of a large dense forest. The forest showed no signs of life, either humanoid, animal or insect. Subject reported feeling "unnerved" by the stillness and the silence, and attempted to leave the forest on foot. Despite travelling for over three weeks on foot, Subject was unable to locate an end to the forest. Subject was forced to scavenge edible looking nuts and fruit in order to survive. When unable to find any more of these nuts or fruit, Subject was forced to start to eat its own belt. When Subject had shifted back to our reality, it still had not seen evidence of life other than itself. However, it did report the feeling of being "watched" and that something was following it. Without further proof of this, it will be recorded as a symptom of the isolation faced by the subject.

* Request: That enough non-perishable rations to last a week be added to its gear. Granted 

**CDY-745-924**
Retrieval: Uneventful

Subject appeared in a world entirely made of candy. It described it as "Willy Wonka's factory but on steroids." Upon reappearing subject appeared to have gained 6.8 kg (15 lb).  

* Request: More candy. Denied  

  **WLM-003-279**
Retrieval: Subject appeared in the middle of the cafeteria unconscious and foaming from the mouth. Medical intervention revealed its blood contained dangerously high levels of Sodium Thiopental, Pancuronium Bromide, and Potassium Chloride. 

Subject appeared in a cell of a maximum security prison. Upon questioning of the guards, Subject learned that it was accused of being a serial killer. It was informed that due to the nature of its crimes, Subject had been sentenced to death. Subject was unable to question guards any further due to the restrictive nature of the prison. Upon meeting with its lawyers, Subject learned that it was scheduled to be executed the following morning. The lawyers then produced a large list of evidence linking the Subject to the crime including fingerprints and security cam footage. This evidence matched up to 507 exactly, including DNA and dental records. The current theory is that the doppelganger of 507 in this dimension was guilty of these murders, and somehow used its powers to escape its cell. An investigation into this incident is ongoing. Upon arriving in the execution chamber, Subject was administered a lethal injection. At the time of its shift back to this dimension, Subject was experiencing heart failure but was able to be saved by Foundation medical staff.

**12N-U677-22F**

Retrieval: Uneventful

Subject arrived in an urban area in a reality which it described later as "a weeaboo's wet dream," which appeared at first to be modern-day Japan. Subject figured out that it had not left the Western hemisphere through attempts to gather information, including successfully accessing the internet on a tablet computer it found in an internet café. Subject spent several days without issue in the alternate reality before shifting back. 

Based on Subject's research and limited conversations with locals, it figured that the point of divergence from our universe was that Japanese sailors discovered a way to America in the 14th century. As a result, America's western coast was colonized by the Japanese and the influx of food and natural resources to Japan resulted in Japan's dominance first in Asia then globally. The Japanese empire and European powers apparently waged several wars in America and Western Asia. The most recent war with the British empire in 1932 resulted in a cold war that lasted until Britain's bankruptcy and the independence of its overseas territories in 1977.


* Retrieved objects: One tablet computer with a solar charger and an external input device acquired by the subject from an internet café. Subject was only able to access its basic functions due to his unfamiliarity with the language. The input device is optimized for the Japanese language. Despite the amount of divergence in the target universe, the computer and its peripheral devices were found to be compatible with modern computers in the baseline universe.
* Request: Japanese lessons. Denied; subject was given access to study material on the Foundation intranet.

**37S-993-8814**

Retrieval: Via tracking device. Subject appeared in ███████,██████ with its feet tied to an anvil and clutching a wooden mallet.

Subject appeared in a large open field in a universe that appeared to be identical to a cel-shaded cartoon. Subject also appeared as a cel-shaded cartoon instead of its normal appearance. Inhabitants appeared to be a combination of funny animals and humanoids with cartoonish features. It appeared that the normal laws of physics did not apply, with the inhabitants instead following a form of cartoon physics. Notably, Subject reported having glanced at the sun, and the sun "told him not to stare and put on a pair of sunglasses". Subject learned it was also affected by these physics, which was determined when Subject was startled by an entity and jumped "at least 100 feet".

* Request: To jump off the roof with a sheet to "see if it still worked". Denied           

**92P-152-92FJ**

Retrieval: Via tracking device. Subject appeared in ████████ with severe lacerations covering its left side and arm. 

Subject appeared in a pitch-black space, with lights floating at head level. Closer examination of these lights revealed them to be a type of fruit, hanging from trees with black bark. The flashlight was noted as "less effective than before." A distant light moved steadily towards the subject. Upon closer inspection of this light, Subject reported it to be a humanoid figure, glowing brightly. The entity was non-hostile, and preferred to follow Subject. After two hours, the entity left the vicinity of Subject, and disappeared among the strange "fruit". Subject noted heavy breathing approximately one hour after the entities' departure. Subject used the flashlight to illuminate the source of breathing, which proved to be an entity "black as coal". This meant that this second entity was almost invisible in the dark. Subject fled from the entity, which gave chase and attacked Subject, causing lacerations down Subject's left side. 

* Request: (Aside from medical attention) A stronger flashlight. Approved.

**HYO-772-939**
Retrieval: Subject appeared in its quarters bleeding from the eyes, ears, nose, and mouth. Subject remained in a coma in Medical Bay C for 42 days after returning. During this time, Subject did not shift or change position at all. 

Subject has very few concrete memories beyond its arrival in this dimension. Subject remembers appearing in a shifting white landscape looking upon a city "made of pure light." The buildings of this city were built into impossible shapes and forms that rendered Subject incapable of describing it in any detail. 
Out of the city came two massive beings who approached the Subject. The very presence of these beings, presumably the inhabitants of the city, caused extreme pain and rapid blindness to the Subject. The beings attempted to speak to the Subject, only for the Subject's eardrums to rupture under the force of their words. Subject's last reported feeling is a sense of "coming undone" before it blacked out. 
When asked to describe what the beings looked like, Subject described them as "looking into the face of God." 
//Note: Despite reporting massive injuries, Subject was completely uninjured when it awoke from its coma. An inquiry into this is ongoing.//

* Request: None

**HYX-324-21K9**

Retrieval: Via tracking device. Subject was discovered in ██████ National Park in the back of a cave halfway up the mountain. Subject was dressed in animal skins and was clutching a crude crossbow. 

Subject was transported to a world where human beings never became the dominant species on Earth. The ruling species was a form of reptile, possibly a descendant of the larger dinosaurs.  
Subject was immediately apprehended upon arrival, stripped of its clothes and gear, and placed on a human reservation. These reservations were used for hunting the remaining humans for sport. Subject was able to survive due to its higher reasoning skills, and ability to hide. Subject spent the remainder of this shift hiding in the trees in order to survive the various hunting parties. 

* Request: Replacement gear. Granted 

**H37-U24-M13**

Retrieval: SCP-507 appeared nude in Basement Hallway-4C, although it still had its belt, knife, and flashlight.

Subject arrived in a dimension "entirely made of living humans". The environment appeared to be completely made of living humans, and Subject conjectured that the population took turns performing various mundane jobs along with acting as its own infrastructure and food source. Subject alleged that women seemed able to self-conceive and go through pregnancy in days without requiring extra food. Subject's clothes were stolen by other people, although it did not have to complete any jobs in its time there (about 7 days).

* Request: "To not have to see any people it does not need to for a few weeks". Granted for three weeks.

**G31-E20-I14**

Retrieval: By Tracking Device. Found approximately 120 km away.

Subject appeared in a dimension made of varying forms of gelatin. The area appeared to be a flat plain stretching to the horizon with occasional small hills about 20 km apart. The subject travelled for about a day before climbing a hill and noticing "a metal object glinting in the distance". The subject continued to travel for several days, occasionally sipping from puddles of liquid gelatin or sleeping, and was approximately 18 km away from the metal object before returning to our dimension

* Request: Subject refused to consume soft foods for nearly a month.

**S33-4G3-BG4**

Retrieval: Appeared about fifteen feet above the ground in the site cafeteria.

Subject appeared in a large basketball court which was occupied by six individuals playing basketball. This group included two humans, two tri-laterally symmetrical insectoid beings, one squid-like organism with a sharp rough brown skin, and one hovering yellow spherical being with eight triple-jointed arms. Subject asked where he was and was told he was in an "All-Species Sports Center". Subject then checked several rooms with various games, most of them unknown and several unplayable by humans, before being taken to a locked room by two creatures wearing orange and pink uniforms. When the subject asked why he was brought there, one of the creatures claimed that he was "being held until closing time for sneaking into the sports centre." Subject stayed there for about seven hours before shifting back.

* Request: None. 

**A10-ER5-436**

Retrieval: Uneventful.

Subject arrived in a dimension where everything was frozen in place as it was on December ██, 2012. Subject found it easy to find food and water, but noted the sky was red and pink and displayed an error message reading "ERROR 14528: LOADING TIME: expec. 228-342 years". Subject spent nearly two months there before shifting back.

* Request: To spend more time with personnel due to "feeling lonely there." Granted. Subject is now sometimes allowed to follow Dr. Garson.

**N4U-0K6-ES2**

Subject appeared in an alternate version of an SCP Foundation site. Subject was allowed to talk with its alternate self and learned that he was in a site belonging to the Supernatural Coverup and Protection Agency, an altered but mostly similar version of the Foundation. Further discussion revealed that nuclear technology had not been discovered, but that it was replaced with a form of energy emitted by rodents when placed in blood or blood plasma of other mammals. The similarity to [http://scp-wiki.net/scp-4062 SCP-4062] has been noted. Subject spent approximately eight days before shifting back.

* Request: A collection of history books to read so that the subject could better note differences in dimensions. Granted.

**AQL-58H-99M**
Retrieval: Via tracking device. Subject appeared in ██████, Idaho and was found by Foundation Agents attempting to hitchhike back to the facility. 

Subject appeared in a dimension where the average human life span was around 24 hours. Residents of this dimension aged at an extremely fast rate so that a baby who was born at 9 AM would have been equivalent to an 85-year old by the following morning. Despite their short life span, citizens would still obtain jobs and marry, just at an accelerated pace. Subject personally witnessed a couple meet, get married, and have two children within the space of three hours. 

Subject remained in this dimension for 2 months. Because of his normal life span, he watched generations live and became internationally famous as "The person who doesn't die." Subject reported that it was treated as a wise elder, and consulted for advice on world events.

* Request: None

**JDP-H0V-KRZ**
Retrieval: Appeared in a janitorial closet in the site basement.

Subject appeared two meters above the stands in a very large indoor sports arena of approximately four kilometers in length and half a kilometer in height. At the center of the arena were four teams wearing orange, yellow, pink, and purple body armor and fatigues respectively, engaged in combat. Each team possessed four members, armed with two anti-tank rocket launchers, four assault rifles, and one tank. Subject was unable to ascertain the approximate amount of people watching the event, but he claimed every seat was full.

After three minutes, subject was apprehended by two guards and escorted to a cell. When subject asked why he was being held, a guard responded: "You have disrupted the daily games and will be held as a player for a future game." Subject was allowed to watch 'the games' on an old-fashioned television in his cell and learned that all games are controlled by someone called "The Master, Zero-Two-Four", who regularly interrupted with rule changes. During the third game the subject watched, several researchers wearing outfits bearing an altered Foundation logo were forced to play in obstacle courses. 

Subject reappeared after approximately thirty-six hours. A very close similarity to SCP-024 has been noted, and 024's research team has been made aware of this event.

* Request: Access to the site gym in case of a similar circumstance. Denied on the grounds that 507 revisiting this dimension in the future is unlikely and that it would not offer a substantially higher chance of winning.

**4H6-78V-FG9**

Retrieval: Subject was found in the on-site break room, with what first appeared to be a series of deep gashes running down the subject’s right cheek, neck, and shoulder. Subject informs that the “gashes” are actually stage makeup.

The subject appeared in a site break room appearing identical to the one of his retrievals at first glance. Researcher ████ and Dr. ███ had been talking about nothing in particular, equipment seen on a television show set production present, along with men in uniforms resembling those of a tv show set worker uniform managing the equipment. Upon taking a closer look, the subject realized the break room was actually just a set for a television or movie. The two doctors replied to the subjects sudden appearance by expressing surprise at his entrance, but for the reason that the subject’s “shift back to our reality scene wasn’t for another ten minutes”. Dr. ███ also informed the subject that he needed to stop by the makeup department. Subject notes that after this Researcher ████ then tells the men managing the equipment to start the scene over from the top.

Subject had just returned from the makeup department back to the apparent “set” when it shifted back into our reality.

* Request: Some time to reflect. - Granted; Subject was taken to site psychologist for a session.

**3LE-4NN-0UT**

Retrieval: Subject was found approximately twenty kilometers from the site.

Subject appeared in what first was thought by subject to be a forest. Subject quickly determined that the "forest" was in a concrete heptagonal tunnel, lit by an unknown brand of blue fluorescent lamp, with each side approximately eight meters long. Subject then discovered that the tunnel contained an incredibly diverse amount of plants, containing many that do not naturally grow even on the same continent. 

Subject soon found the phrase "043 WARNING" written in yellow spray paint exactly every one hundred meters, with an abnormally large bloody handprint on the wall near each message. Each handprint was approximately sixty (60) centimeters long and twenty (20) centimeters wide. Subject attempted to find an end to the tunnel, eating many of the recognizable plant species he could find, but did not reach the end. Subject shifted back after six days.

* Request: None

**TE2-OO1-AN9**

Retrieval: Subject fell approximately nine meters to the site's roof and broke his leg. Subject is currently healing in the site infirmary.

Subject woke up in a dark room, with a clock displaying the time and date as 07:33:84, 3120 GAN 01. Subject quickly found a staircase and ascended eight levels of stairs before reaching what the subject described as "an airplane control room", overlooking a destroyed airfield, with several dozen stone statues standing in various poses outside. After the subject blinked, it was noticed that almost every visible statue had moved. Subject spent the remaining four days of the shift hiding in the stairwell with his flashlight attempting to read magazines and flight manuals in an unknown language. Subject noted no people during this shift, but claims to have heard explosions in the distance three days into the shift.

**WQ6-927-DH7**

Retrieval: Subject was retrieved in a large blue dog costume, with large patches anomalously fused to the subject's skin. The costume was removable, but large portions of the subject's skin had to be taken off, prompting a skin graft.

Subject arrived in a building exactly like the Foundation's site ██, excluding that all staff seemed to be wearing anthropomorphic animal costumes. The staff quickly tried to corner the subject, talking about something called, “being furred”. The subject escaped and ran off in a different direction, but due to its broken leg sustained during the last shift was caught by a different staff member, who then put a large blue dog costume on the subject, who then felt large amounts of pain and then shifted back. 

* Request: A thin skin suit. - granted

**LYM-240-ERP**

Retrieval: Via tracking device. Subject was found on a deep sea fishing boat in the Southern Pacific. 

Subject appeared on a 2 lane highway in the middle of a desert. There were no signs of any other lifeforms. The highway itself bore signs of damage as if it had recently been through a large battle. Signs were placed every hundred feet which bore the phrase "STAY ON THE ROAD!" and "THE ROAD WILL KEEP YOU SAFE." For lack of a better option, and because it isn't one to ignore road signs, Subject set off down the road. 

While it was walking, Subject witnessed several mirages in the desert. Subject reported that these took the form of its friends and family all gesturing for Subject to join them in the sand. As time wore on, these illusions became more elaborate. Subject reports one notable instance where his mother appeared alongside "pizza parlor that was also a water slide inside a giant fire breathing robot."

On one occasion, the Subject was forced to leave the road due to a massive crater that prevented him from crossing it. During this time, Subject reported "shifting" underneath its feet and a general sense of unease. Subject shifted back to our dimension after 4 days.

* Request: None    

**W7R-O18-1D3**

Retrieval: Via Tracking Device. Subject found waiting in a public library approximately three hundred kilometers from the site.

Subject appeared in a body of water and quickly swam to the surface, quickly discovering it was floating on a giant ocean. Subject tread water for nearly two hours before sighting a ship in the distance and signalling it by reflecting light off his knife. Subject was quickly picked up by said ship.

The ship was found to be a fishing vessel with much higher technology than in our dimension, and with a crew of about a dozen sentient slug-like creatures. The subject was at first unable to communicate with the crew but was able to develop a rudimentary system of communication by drawing images. Subject was allowed to stay on the vessel and be fed in return for helping clean beds. Subject describes the experience as “the most disgusting thing [he’s] ever done”. Approximately nine days and twelve hours passed before subject shifted back.

* Retrieved Items: One half-eaten purple fish with a hair-like substance growing from the back

**N3O-MSI-R1C**

Retrieval: Uneventful

Subject appeared in an alternate Foundation site where every solid and liquid object was “crimson red”, including all living organisms. Subject was contained and designated Anomalous Object 598 for his strange appearance. According to one researcher at the alternate site, SCP-507 “is a completely normal human but looks so strange. It hurts normal eyes.” Subject was contained for about twenty hours before shifting back.

* Requests: A green blanket instead of its current red blanket. Granted.

**M7E-F52-198**

Retrieval: Uneventful

Subject appeared in a featureless white room containing nothing but the subject and the late 41st President of the United States George H. W. Bush. George H. W. Bush proceeded to produce wet broccoli from an unknown location and continually throw it at the subject while repeatedly saying “1992.”

* Requests: None

**2Q2-W1E-R18**

Retrieval: Uneventful

Subject appeared in a room with entirely black walls, ceiling, and floor. After the subject got its bearings, it attempted to knock on several walls. After knocking a few times, the subject noticed a humanoid entity standing in the corner. Said entity was wearing a standard Foundation D-Class uniform and appeared human from the neck down, but the entity’s head was that of a domestic house cat, complete with fur and whiskers. The entity than proceeded to hit 507 in the stomach with a baseball bat it had been holding. When asked why it did this, the entity responded “You know damn well, punk. Don’t leave.” The entity then walked through one of the room’s walls. Subject spent the remainder of its shift unsuccessfully attempting to break out of the room.

* Requests: None. Subject’s bruised abdomen taken care of.

**507-E56-T8G**

Retrieval: Subject found bleeding and bruised in the hallway outside its containment chamber. Medical assistance was given and the subject is currently healing.

Subject shifted into an incredibly large dark room filled with thousands of other humanoids, of which nearly fifty percent (50%) were identical to 507 in appearance, with an additional forty percent (40%) appearing to be 507 with minor or major changes such as sex, race, height, scarring, uniform, build, weight, and species, including gorilla, SCP-1000, and a species resembling SCP-2703. Subject began to talk with the other confused 507s and quickly determined that they were other realities’ equivalents of itself, such as a 507 wearing a business suit who had never told anyone of his reality shifts and had never heard of the SCP Foundation.

After a few minutes, a loud voice was heard from the ceiling that gave an announcement. “Attention dimension-hoppers; for your crimes against the order and the separation of worlds, you shall be terminated.” Following this, several thousand bullet-like objects were fired into the crowd of 507s. After approximately ten seconds, all 507s in the room began to shift back to their various dimensions with subject shifting back to our reality after sixteen seconds. Subject was hit in the arm with one bullet that passed completely through while trying to shield himself and sustained severe bruising and a broken rib from the stampede of other 507s caused in the panic.

* Retrieved Items: Subject shifted back with one corpse that it had been touching with both feet when it shifted back. The corpse was human and a complete genetic/physical match for SCP-507 from the waist up but ended in a large flesh-colored snake tail that was five meters long. The corpse’s cause of death was determined to have been caused by two of the bullet-like objects entering its head. One was found lodged in the corpse’s right frontal lobe and is available for study. The corpse has been put in indefinite cold storage and has not shifted back to its dimension for reasons unknown.
* Requests: Lessons on how to avoid gunfire and other projectiles. Granted, subject given access to manuals on cover and concealment. Protective armor: Denied.

**PCS-010-DCM**

Retrieval: Uneventful

Subject appeared in a containment cell matching its own and quickly learned that it was in a site owned by the “MCD Foundation” whose motto is “Maintain. Contain. Detain.” The alternate reality was different from ours in that seemingly every evil individual/group was good and vice versa. The MCD Foundation was allied with the “Lion’s Paw” and the “Global Containment Organization”, and was enemies with “Seckle, Charon, and Phenworth”, an organization that supposedly tortures anomalies.

The rest of the shift was uneventful and the subject was allowed to tour up to level three areas of the site. Subject’s PCS-010-DCM equivalent shifted back to that reality after two days and was allowed to talk with subject. Of note is that the PCS-010-DCM equivalent of SCP-507 was referred to as MCD-705.

**493-SPA-4D8**

Retrieval: Subject recovered seventeen kilometers away riding to the site with a recovered bicycle-like vehicle.

Subject woke up in a wheat field and quickly discovered it had shifted onto a field near a farmhouse and a barn. The subject then went to the farmhouse to attempt to find signs of life, and was greeted by an elderly Caucasian man and the man’s family. The man was able to somewhat communicate with subject using a book that the subject later found to be a Spanish-to-English dictionary. The subject gave a cover story of having developed partial amnesia and managed to find that he was in a country that had rebelled from the prominent “Spanish Empire”, an empire that controlled much of western Europe and almost all of North and South America, in the year 1763 CE.

The subject was given a ride into a nearby town and some money and spent most of the remainder of its shift in the town’s public library using an advanced computer system that offered English as a language. The subject managed to find a vehicle resembling a bicycle in a trash can and was riding said vehicle when it shifted back to our reality.

•	Retrieved Items: One vehicle resembling a bicycle but with three wheels in a row, a seat with a backrest, and a broken brake system. Several paper bills printed with purple ink depicted various unknown people and various Spanish phrases.
•	Request: None

**952-7YD-ABBA**

Retrieval: Subject appeared in the medical wing of Site ███ in ███,███ screaming and wildly swinging a chair.

Subject appeared in the maternity ward of a large hospital. Each of the cribs with an infant in it were fitted with an opaque glass screen that was locked multiple times. Subject was discovered by a being dressed as a nurse checking on the infants. Subject was unable to describe the appearance of the nurse as it began screaming every time it tried.[[footnote]] Subject submitted what it claimed was a drawing of the creature, but it was merely a wild mass of jagged lines. [[/footnote]]

The creature spoke to the Subject in a pleasant voice that "You have been upsetting the other patients" with its appearance and that "it was time to start the operation." 
The nurse then pounced on the subject and wrapped him in a straight jacket before wheeling him into an operation room. When the straight jacket was removed, Subject jumped off the table and attempted to fend off the creatures when it shifted back. 

•	Retrieved Items: One chair. It appears to be a normal office chair, but further tests must be performed. 

•	Requests: A memory wipe. Denied.
          
**Addendum 507-3B-00:**  Due to a particularly trying encounter with ███-███, several documents in the archives have been altered, corrupted, or technically-never-existed. Document 507-3B appears to have been affected by this, and is currently being rebuilt using backup files, references, and █████ respectively. Subject matter may occasionally increase, decrease, or undergo modifications in light of this. //-Dr.// ███
