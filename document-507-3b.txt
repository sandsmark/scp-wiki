**Foreword:** Below is an archive of all documented “shifts” undergone by [[[SCP-507]]]. Each of these entries are presented with their contents in the following order:
* Dimensional label (created upon discovery of a “new” reality, for ease of later reference) 
* Retrieval (used for the documentation of any complications or anomalies in the recovery of SCP-507 post-shift)
* Description of reality, and description of any aftereffects caused by visiting said reality.
* Request (listings of any special requests made by 507 upon return, or for noting any ”souvenirs” retrieved from the shift)

**1B7-55E-728**
Retrieval: Uneventful.

Subject arrived in a desert environment, and wandered around for roughly an hour before encountering another human. Said human was wearing a tanned leather overcoat and was described as "completely unshaven." Said man was extremely surprised to find the subject, and demanded that he be followed in order to lead it back to food and shelter.

Subject originally began to follow the man, but intentionally lost contact with him upon noticing that his leather coat contained no seams or stitching. 

* Request: None.

**9E2-66V-7HG5**
Retrieval: Uneventful.

Subject arrived in a forest habitat, with no signs of previous or current industrialization. No further anomalies were perceptible until the subject grew hungry, at which point it discovered that harvesting or eating the plant life would cause them to emit “telepathic screams”. Subject abstained from eating for the first day because of this, but became hungry enough on the second day onward to consume the flora in spite of the screams.

Testing has shown no biological changes in the subject from this, but subject repeatedly affirms that it “felt horrible” for doing so.

* Request: None specifically, but subject adopted a gelatin- and pudding-based diet for two and a half weeks after returning from this shift.

**J75-R63-3TF**
Retrieval: Uneventful.

Subject arrived in a dimension with flipped genders. No notable differences besides this were discovered, although subject found issue with the fact that its female counterpart “looks pretty much the same” as the standard version.

* Request: None.

**000-000-000** (Invalid)
Retrieval: Via tracking device. Plainclothes agents found subject sitting in an alleyway at ███████, ███████.

Subject was largely unresponsive upon retrieval, and remained so until the standard questioning phase. When asked where it went this shift, subject answered, “Nowhere. I think I missed it this time.”

Subject experienced minor motor skill impairment and decreased activity levels for roughly a month after this shift.

* Request: A nightlight, and a wristwatch which makes an audible “tick” as the second hand moves. Both were approved.

**J7Q-53Y-8ST**
Retrieval: Subject was found in its quarters, sprawled on the floor, attempting to gnaw through the “sleeves” of a straitjacket it was wearing. The jacket, leg restraints, and the loss of motor skills still present from the last shift led to the subject being unable to stand up or open the door to find assistance.

Subject shifted while sleeping, and awoke restrained and lying in a hospital-grade bed. A nurse informed the subject that he was still a patient at the ████ ██ asylum, and was currently suffering from advanced stages of dementia. Subject was then sedated, and spent the rest of this shift alternating between sub-consciousness and total unconsciousness.

* Request: Disregarding “Get this [EXPLETIVE] thing off me,” none.

**9E2-66V-7HG5-2**
Retrieval: Subject found in its quarters, balled up with its hands over its ears.

Subject once again arrived in the forest habitat from 9E2-66V-7HG5. The flora seemed to have remembered subject’s last visit, though, and they reacted by “screaming” for its entire four-day shift.

* Request: A hug. Approved.

**6K3-21B-I0S**
[DATA EXPUNGED]

**BN2-AL6-CTE**
Retrieval: Uneventful.

Subject arrived in a derelict metropolitan area. Subject was unable to locate any other humans, but noted an overabundance of cats in every area it visited. Said felines seemed no different from normal housecats, though, and subject spent most of this shift petting any who came near.

During the standard examination procedures after retrieval, trace amounts of a Toxoplasma gondii variant were discovered on the subject’s clothing, as well as larger amounts on its shoes. Further testing showed that subject had not yet been infected with the Toxoplasmosis variant, most likely attributed to the short timeframe of this shift not allowing the subject to grow hungry and seek out food.

All clothing and belongings that were on subject's person during this shift were incinerated, and the subject forced to undergo special decontamination procedures, in order to prevent any possibility of contagion.

* Request: a pair of rubber gloves. Denied, on the basis that hand protection would not have prevented subject from infection in any way.

**125-28P-OS4-3**
Retrieval: Via tracking device. Subject was attempting to return on its own, but was making less progress than usual due to the discomfort of doing so.

Subject once again arrived in a pitch-black area, with muted breathing nearby. Subject decided to seek an exit this time via blind wandering. Subject eventually found itself at the mouth of a corridor with what appeared to be a light source at the end. Subject began to run towards the light upon noticing this.

As it grew closer, the light suddenly grew in intensity and the subject was exposed to “searing pain.” Subject passed out at this point, and only awoke after it had shifted back.

Examination upon retrieval revealed that the subject’s epidermis had been cleanly stripped down to the stratum granulosum in all areas open to sunlight, and down to the stratum lucidum in all areas covered by clothing.

* Request: None, but subject reappeared wearing a pair of large, heavily tinted sunglasses. Subject did not notice that it was wearing these until they were pointed out, and supposed that they were probably why its eyes did not undergo the same process as its skin.

**7F2-WA3-193**
Retrieval: Uneventful.

Subject arrived in an urban area, with no major changes as far as it could tell. Subject used the public computers of a library to search for differences between this dimension and ours, eventually finding that Abraham Lincoln was assassinated by his Vice President in order to claim his position. This ultimately led to the Presidency becoming a “tribe-leader-like” position, where the current holder is legally allowed to be challenged and overthrown by other suitable candidates.

Subject noted, with great surprise, that this change did not do much to alter the times that most “major” presidents took and held the office. Many of the minor and/or detrimental presidencies tended to end via bullet wounds, often in unlikely locales or from improbable angles, which deterred most from attempting coups at all.

* Request: None.

**WS6-ECU-83D**
Retrieval: Uneventful.

Subject arrived at the mouth of a cave, surrounded by “almost unbearable” heat. Subject walked outside the cave for further investigation, to find that the area around it was a baked wasteland. Most of the heat appeared to emanate from two suns in the sky, which the subject could not decide on whether they were extremely large or extremely close to the planet.

Upon further examination, the “suns” blinked and turned away, taking the heat with them.

Subject spent rest of this shift as far back in the cave as possible.

* Request: None.

**Q56-DRU-865**
Retrieval: Subject found in the cafeteria, masticating on what appeared to be [REDACTED].

Upon containment of [REDACTED], Subject uttered the words, "More! More! More!" before losing consciousness.

Subject regained consciousness 2 hours later, expressing a strong desire for pudding. When questioned, Subject claimed to see "the biggest mound of pudding ever". When questioned as to why he was masticating on [REDACTED] upon arrival, subject claimed to be eating a "glob a pudding" at the time. 

Subject reported seeing [REDACTED] rolling around the hallways. Hallucinations passed within 24 hours.

* Request: Pudding. Request granted.

**F24-9S6-33C**
Retrieval: Subject found in Service Tunnel 6r3bk without original equipment. Subject was wearing a simple uniform with a similar design to the current Foundation D-class uniform.

Subject shifted while dining in the cafeteria. Destination dimension had an analogue to the Foundation with a facility in the same location, although internal layout had significant differences. Security responded to subject as an intruder and detained it immediately. During this process the subject was imprisoned and stripped of all equipment, including tracking device. For remainder of shift subject underwent repeated questioning, the Foundation analogue refused to accept subject's explanation of dimension hopping.

Information gleaned from post-shift debriefing indicates that F24-9S6-33C has a Foundation analogue in the Society for Containment of the Paranormal. This analogue has a strong British influence, and is opposed by the Covert Occult Group and Church of the Mending God. Further details remain unclear as the Society refused to answer the subjects questions and only slipped details by assuming it knew them already.

* Request: Replacement equipment. Request granted.

**4GT-F1Q-H17**
Retrieval: Subject was found by the cafeteria kitchen staff, drenched, covered in mud, and suffering from severe hypothermia.

Subject arrived in what appeared to be a large field during a rainstorm. Subject attempted to find shelter from the rain, but found none. Subject remained in the rain for the entire shift. Subject saw shapes moving in the rain, which seemed to move progressively closer from all directions. Subject was unable to see the shapes clearly through the rain, but just before returning one came close enough that the subject could hear labored breathing.

* Requests: a set of warm clothing. Approved

**2AW-9U2-E5T**
Retrieval: Uneventful.

Subject arrived in midair, falling from an outdoor environment into a subterranean body of water at the bottom of a large cavern. Though admittedly experiencing a strong surge of adrenalin from this event, subject reported swimming 'a long way' before reaching land. Subsequent observation revealed a giant hole in the ceiling of the cavern, through which subject had apparently fallen. Also reported were archways to other large caverns, most with shafts of sunlight visible indicating other surface collapses. Regular vertical grooves in the walls indicate possible excavation, despite the caverns' immense size. No other sign of life was observed.

Before returning, subject realized that the possibility of shifting back to our reality so far underground might cause it to be displaced in solid rock, and spent its remaining time frantically searching for a way back to the surface. When subject succeeded, it discovered that the sink holes were much more widespread than what had been visible from below ground.
* Request: Diving Lessons. Denied.

**2UU-5I9-Q3D**
Retrieval: Upon seeing Foundation personnel in ████████, ████, subject approached them and requested to be recontained, showing knowledge of SCPs that were of Level 3 clearance.

The length of time the subject was absent from our reality was notable, being roughly three months in length. However, during this time, he made several notable discoveries, including several SCPs uncontained by our reality's SCP Foundation but contained by Universe 2UU-5I9-Q3D's equivalent. These SCPs have now been contained.

Through this three-month time frame, the subject managed to become a member of 2UU-5I9-Q3D's SCP Foundation equivalent, working his way up the ranks far faster than would have been anticipated assuming it had been made a member of Foundation personnel on the same day. At the time of his return, he was apparently in the field, working to contain 2UU-5I9-Q3D's equivalent of SCP-███. Curiously, our Foundation had sent out a Task Force for precisely the same reason, on the same day. Further links between Universe 2UU-5I9-Q3D and our reality are being investigated.

* Request: To be made a member of Site personnel. Denied.

**3JT-3MD-DIG**
Retrieval:  Subject retrieved via implanted tracker; medivac required to Site ██

Subject was immobile upon retrieval due to greatly increased body mass, measured at ███ kg.  Lead Researcher ██████ approved emergency use of [[[SCP-394]]] to keep it alive in order to obtain a report.

Upon recovery, subject reported being surrounded by "really [EXPLETIVE] big"  creatures resembling ██████████.  They quickly trapped him in a transparent container.  It was then transported an unknown distance to a shiny surface, whereupon the creatures began to observe him.  After approximately one day tubes were inserted into [DATA EXPUNGED] unknown fluid which was not found upon examination.

Subject reported that the tubes were removed shortly before the shift and it observed [REDACTED] approaching it, presumably for the purpose of extraction.

* Request: Services of a personal trainer.  Dr. ████████ has agreed to let the subject borrow her workout tapes.  Subject now displays a strong aversion to pudding.


**Addendum 507-3B-00:**  Due to a particularly trying encounter with ███-███, several documents in the archives have been altered, corrupted, or technically-never-existed. Document 507-3B appears to have been affected by this, and is currently being rebuilt using backup files, references, and █████ respectively. Subject matter may occasionally increase, decrease, or undergo modifications  in light of this. //-Dr.//███
