**About the Author:** Sirpudding lives in Southern California (although in a relatively quiet part), where he is over twenty years into attempting to finish the longest Biology degree in the history of education. He has worked as a convenience store clerk, boy scout camp counselor, movie theater projectionist, and QA for a major software company. He is currently employed as an Environmental Services Technician for a small company serving the offshore oil industry and also has published some roleplaying game articles in SJGames' //**[[[http://www.sjgames.com/pyramid/| Pyramid Magazine]]]**//. In 2008, while serving in the USMC Reserves, he deployed to Al Anbar,  Iraq, and participated in mobile operations there. He also has a cat[[footnote]] The cat is adorable. Also old, though its hard to tell unless you look at the vet bill. He's like one of those 70 year old dudes that runs marathons and then falls down and breaks his hip in the shower. [[/footnote]]. He blogs about tabletop roleplaying games at [*http://papermenplasticmonster.blogspot.com/ Of Paper Men and Plastic Monsters.]

**A Word from the Author:** Hello, I'm sirpudding. I'm relatively new around here (joined in April of 2015, I believe). I'm here to write short fiction, improve my writing, and generally get the demons out of my head (and have fun doing it). I'm happy to answer questions in the discussion thread for this page or by PM[[footnote]] Though not chat generally, I find it to be a little too chaotic and overwhelming. [[/footnote]]. My [http://scpsandbox2.wikidot.com/sirpudding sandbox] might have whatever I'm working on at the moment, but I do a lot of writing offline, so it might also not.

+++ SCP-2323 "Sentinel Butcher" 
For my first article I wanted to make sure that I had a solid idea that wasn't treading any well-trod ground. I spent a few weeks brainstorming and then wrote this. I'm not entirely sure where I got the idea from, except that I have always found shrikes to be a little creepy in a "red in tooth and claw" kind of way. They are songbird-raptors. They also use tools to feed. Some people didn't seem to get it right away, but it definitely seems to have found an audience. Ironically I feel like it maybe was //too// good for a first article, nothing I've written since has been as successful.

+++ SCP-2890 "Magic Certainly"
I've long found the song "Frosty the Snowman" to have a horror element that nobody else seems to see. Many people seem to think that the //snowman// was magical but the song is really about the //hat//. "There must have been some magic in that old top hat they found". What kind of magic animates humanoid simulacra? What kind of magician uses immortality to hang around children? What if the song was based on suppressed memories of real events? 

This article had a very difficult birth. During critique, I added a lot of material in order to try to answer questions that in hindsight I probably should have left unanswered. There originally was a supplemental page called "LAVENDER CIRCLE" that detailed the Foundations attempts to find the origin and purpose of the artifact. I ended up self-deleting that (and so far that is the only page of mine to be deleted) and paired down the article almost to how it started before I got any feedback at all.

There's also the question of where the Foundation gets children for experiments. I took the suggestion that they sometimes source D-Class from refugee communities and ran with it. After all, it would be even worse to just take the parents and leave the children alone in some displaced persons camp, right?

I'm not really happy with how this article turned out, and I may try to rewrite it someday. Although it is just successful enough that I'm afraid to mess with it.

+++ SCP-2673 "The Hunter in Words"
There was a failed SCP that appeared to be poetic, but was probably only accidentally so, which inspired me to write about a kind of info-life monster that could only be imprisoned in poetry. I thought about poets who died young (and I really wish I could of worked Keats in there, maybe I'll put him in the containment log eventually) and Marlowe immediately sprang to mind, which suggested the link to [[[SCP-2264]]].

As I started writing I realized that this is a perfect excuse for [[[SCP-2673 Containment Maintenance Log| a collaborative log.]]] Between the lethal kill trigger poem, the containment sonnet, the description, and the first three poems of the containment log, I ended up writing six poems for this article.

It wasn't easy to write a long poem in iambic pentameter with a complex rhyme scheme that //also// was a coherent SCP description with all the usual checkpoints. Some of the liberties I took with scansion seem to have been too much for some readers. If anybody wants to point out the parts where the meter fails totally for them, I'm happy to try and fix it.

I wasn't really aware of the really very similar haiku article, at the time. I'm not sure if I would have written this in that case.

+++ SCP-2631 "Standard Containment Planet"
This is a rewrite of [[*user daveyoufool]]'s original SCP-2631. I was watching the original fail, and offering suggestions on how to save it and had a fairly good idea of what a rewrite would look like when it went to deletion. I kept dave's original title "Cruciform Snare" as a codename in this version. I felt it had a very poetic golden-age-of-science-fiction quality that needed to be retained. This article has multiple K-Class scenarios which is pretty cool, I think. 

I tried to make this as hard-ish SF an object as this form allows. I am pretty pleased with the results. 

In the discussion page I made a lengthy post with case-by-case analysis of the effectiveness of of the 99-Tripurantaka protocol (//Tripurantaka// by the way is the four-armed avatar of Shiva that destroyed the Asura's sky fortresses in Rig Vedic myth), and it was pretty nifty so I'll reproduce it here:

> Let us assume that the following are true:
> * The preconditions for a 99-Tripurantaka event is a Keter level object at the verge of a K-Class scenario with potential interstellar consequences. 
> * The array's first response is containment either via nanobots or something more esoteric (like the 1987 experiment). 
> * The planet cracker relativistic impact is a worst case destruction failsafe. 
> 
> The purpose of 99-Tripurantaka is both to neutralize SCP-2631 and prevent the triggering k-class event. 
> 
> The following scenarios may occur:
> [[collapsible show="+ Case-by-case analysis" hideLocation="both"]]
> +++ Case I
> **99-Tripurantaka:** Not Deployed
> **Array Containment:**Deployed/Fails
> **Array Destruct:** Deployed/Success
> **Triggering Keter:** Survives/Escapes
> **Result:** Planetary XK event caused by relativistic impact. Keter Object is freed for larger scale K-Class event. 
> **Notes:** Worst case scenario.
> ------
> +++ Case II
> **99-Tripurantaka:** Not Deployed
> **Array Containment:**Deployed/Fails
> **Array Destruct:** Deployed/Fails
> **Triggering Keter:**  Survives/Escapes 
> **Result:** Planetary XK event followed by larger scale K-Class scenario, both caused by Keter object. 
> **Notes:** Net result identical to Case I. 
> ------
> +++ Case III
> **99-Tripurantaka:** Not Deployed
> **Array Containment:**Deployed/Fails
> **Array Destruct:** Deployed/Success
> **Triggering Keter:**  Destroyed
> **Result:** Planetary XK event caused by relativistic impact.
> **Notes:** We are extinct but at least the galaxy is safe. 
> ------
> +++ Case IV
> **99-Tripurantaka:** Not Deployed
> **Array Containment:**Deployed/Succeeds 
> **Array Destruct:** Not Deployed
> **Triggering Keter:**  Contained by Array
> **Result:** Potential catastrophic restructuring or extinction of human civilization. 
> **Notes:** May be survivable but this is unknowable.  In an eariler draft I had a memo discussing treating this as a potential Thaumiel. Eskobar pointed out this is like a plan to have a bully punch you in the face to kill a spider on your nose. 
> ------
> +++ Case V
> **99-Tripurantaka:** Deployed/Fails 
> **Array Containment:**Deployed/ As Cases I-IV. 
> **Array Destruct:** As Cases I-IV. 
> **Triggering Keter:**  As Cases I-IV. 
> **Result:** As Cases I-IV. 
> **Notes:** As Cases I-IV. Given the vast gulf in technology and resources this is probably the most likely outcome of a 99-Tripurantaka deployment. 
> ------
> +++ Case VI
> **99-Tripurantaka:** Deployed/Succeeds only in destroying the array. 
> **Array Containment:** Destroyed by Foundation 
> **Array Destruct:** Deployed/As Cases I-III.
> **Triggering Keter:**  As Cases I-III.
> **Result:** As Cases I-III. 
> **Notes:** As Cases I-III. All outcomes result in human extinction. 
> ------
> +++ Case VII
> **99-Tripurantaka:** Deployed/Succeeds both in destroying the array, and containing/destroying/neutralizing  the Keter.
> **Array Containment:** Destroyed by Foundation 
> **Array Destruct:** Not Deployed or Deployed/Fails 
> **Triggering Keter:**  Contained (or Neutralized/Destroyed) by human action. 
> **Result:** Humanity survives with mitigated damage. 
> **Notes:** Probable best case post-deployment scenario. This is the one that communicating with the other organizations helps the most with. 
> ------
> +++ Case VIII
> **99-Tripurantaka:** Deployed/Succeeds both in destroying the array, and containing/destroying/neutralizing  the Keter.
> **Array Containment:** Destroyed by Foundation 
> **Array Destruct:** Deployed/Succeeds
> **Triggering Keter:**  Contained (or Neutralized/Destroyed) by human action. 
> **Result:** XK scenario due to relativistic impact. 
> **Notes:** Ironic extinction event. This could result from the aliens being unable to recall the impactor after destruction of the array or from punishing us for destroying it. Or just too-late containment after the point of no return. 
> ------
> +++ Case IX
> **99-Tripurantaka:** Not Deployed or Deployed/Fails
> **Array Containment:**Deployed/Fails or only partially succeeds.
> **Array Destruct:** Deployed/Fails 
> **Triggering Keter:** Causes less than full scale event. 
> **Result:** Human civilization badly damaged but species survives. 
> **Notes:** Post apocalypse scenario. This one also benefits from warning the other organizations. Least likely scenario as the impactor probably won't just miss.
> [[/collapsible]]
>
> As you can see, if it gets to this point there really aren't any //good// options. Much better to control the Keter before anything else happens. 
> 
> Of course if any of the initial assumptions about the aliens motives or capabilities are wrong, then this whole line of reasoning may be fatally misguided.

+++ SCP-2140 "Retroconverter"
This was my entry into the "Short Works Contest". I was listening to the story [http://escapepod.org/2015/06/01/ep494-the-retgun/ "The Retgun"] by Tim Pratt on EscapePod while driving to a work site. I started thinking about an SCP that retroactively recruits people into the Foundation and probably inspired by the Ken Hite's **//[http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/madnessdossier/ GURPS Horror: The Madness Dossier]//** the idea for a glyph that does this when you look at, being re-purposed from a civilization on the other side of an ontoclysm (which of course simply had to be the Daevites) was born. 

I originally started outlining this as a //very long// piece, but it wasn't really working. Most of the material would have logically been quite boring to read. Then I saw the contest and decided to see if I could make it work at 500 words or less.

As far as I can tell, I now have the shortest Thaumiel (and I'm glad I didn't actually check to see how few Thaumiels there actually are; I may have been too intimidated to try this). 

There seems to be quite a few people that wanted a longer treatment, and I may add some supplementary material if I can figure out how to make it work.

++ Non SCP stuff:
I contributed short-short stories to [[[and-then-i-died3| And Then I Died... Part III]]]. Rounds four, ten, sixteen and seventeen are mine. Round sixteen answers MacLeod's challenge before he issued it and round seventeen is supposed to be pretty good.
