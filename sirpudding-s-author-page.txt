**About the Author:** Sirpudding lives in Southern California (although in a relatively quiet part), where he is over twenty years into attempting to finish the longest Biology degree in the history of education. He has worked as a convenience store clerk, boy scout camp counselor, movie theater projectionist, and QA for a major software company. He is currently employed as an Environmental Services Technician for a small company serving the offshore oil industry and also has published some roleplaying game articles in SJGames' //**[[[http://www.sjgames.com/pyramid/| Pyramid Magazine]]]**//. In 2008, while serving in the USMC Reserves, he deployed to Al Anbar,  Iraq, and participated in mobile operations there. He also has a cat[[footnote]] The cat is adorable. Also old, though its hard to tell unless you look at the vet bill. He's like one of those 70 year old dudes that runs marathons and then falls down and breaks his hip in the shower. [[/footnote]]. As a reenactor,  he was a member of the Clan Maccolin of Glenderry (since 1996) and participated in The Southern California Renaissance Faire as well as other events since 1993[[footnote]] He plans to try to start something completely new there in 2016. [[/footnote]]. He blogs about tabletop roleplaying games at [*http://papermenplasticmonster.blogspot.com/ Of Paper Men and Plastic Monsters.]

**A Word from the Author:** Hello, I'm sirpudding. I'm relatively new around here (joined in April of 2015, I believe). I'm here to write short fiction, improve my writing, and generally get the demons out of my head (and have fun doing it). I'm happy to answer questions in the discussion thread for this page or by PM[[footnote]] Though not chat generally, I find it to be a little too chaotic and overwhelming. [[/footnote]]. My [http://scpsandbox2.wikidot.com/sirpudding sandbox] might have whatever I'm working on at the moment, but I do a lot of writing offline, so it might also not.

[[tab SCP-2323 "Sentinel Butcher"]] 
For my first article I wanted to make sure that I had a solid idea that wasn't treading any well-trod ground. I spent a few weeks brainstorming and then wrote this. I'm not entirely sure where I got the idea from, except that I have always found shrikes to be a little creepy in a "red in tooth and claw" kind of way. They are songbird-raptors. They also use tools to feed. Some people didn't seem to get it right away, but it definitely seems to have found an audience. Ironically I feel like it maybe was //too// good for a first article, nothing I've written since has been as successful.

[[collapsible show="+ To expand on that:" hide="-To expand on that:"]] 
+++ Brainstorming:
* I read, and then reread all of the guides. 
* I made sure I read every article that was posted recently including the discussion threads. 
* I thought about what succeeds and what fails with the current audience based on what I learned.
* I knew I didn't want a humanoid, or a Keter, or a Thaumiel because these are all supposed to be harder to have succeed according to the guides. 
* I think that I was following the advice to think of something that is ordinary but has an emotional association for me that isn't obvious.
*  In this case, as I said, shrikes are a little bit incongruous and creepy. They are cute little songbirds, that are raptors that use tools to impale their prey. 
* Then I thought about how to communicate this, and it occurred to me that if you were the bird's prey they would appear to be especially monstrous. I suppose here I was inspired by Dan Simmons' //Hyperion// which has a terrifying time traveling robot killer called The Strike that also impales its victims, or more accurately: Simmons was inspired by the same thing I was and I was reminded of this. 
* I didn't want giant birds that kill people. 
 * Giant animals are difficult to do in a way that isn't B-Movie silly 
 * Monsters that just  kill people are inherently the most well-trod subject of supernatural horror.
 * Worse, giant birds that kill people aren't really a believable threat because we would just kill them [[footnote]] In fact this is one of those "nature is a better horror writer than you" things. We actually did drive [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haast%27s_eagle a giant bird that ate people] into extinction.[[/footnote]] as we do with tigers, sharks and so on in the real world. 
 * Besides, giant shrikes lose the whole "cute passerine" thing that is the central frisson of my idea. 
* I needed a prey animal that humans could identify with more than voles and sparrows, and it needed to be anomalous (otherwise I am just writing the wikipedia article on Shrikes). I needed tiny people. 
* Flower fairies are tiny people. 
* Shrikes have been known to use man-made thorn substitutes (like barbed wire) making the connection to fairies obvious. As humans have done, my shrikes have learned to kill the good folk with cold iron. 
* Since it's a learned behavior, I could write about ordinary shrikes, with an anomalous meme. Which plays into another thing I like to think about: learning and tool use in birds. 
* I had once written for a collaborative story a bonsai garden where the evidence of tiny human sacrifice appears but no tiny humans are ever visible. I realized that I could recycle this here. Which developed another layer. How do people react to an unstoppable giant monster that kills them in a particularly spectacular and gruesome way? Religious ritual. 
* Putting all of this together I realized I had an article about a meme, that doesn't affect humans, that interacts with this really anomalous thing, which itself can't be observed directly. So my theme is that the Foundation is containing ordinary birds and teaching them to kill and eat sapient creatures, which otherwise they are unable to contain or study. A theme well supported by the cold clinicism of an SCP. 

+++ Writing
* I read up on shrikes (mostly the Wikipedia article). 
* I wrote the article over about three days. If there was anything I wasn't sure about I looked it up. 
* When I write SCPs, I keep [[[How to Write an SCP]]], as well as both the wiki text reference and the wiki code snippets collection open on tabs.
* I find that I usually have to do some calculations when I write. I try to triple check the math when I do. Inevitably I make errors (in this case in the number of generations of shrikes that would be part of this containment).

+++ Feedback 
* I made a thread for my draft on the forum: http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-1185591 (obviously the sandbox link isn't going to show you this draft but rather my current one). 
* I went on the chat and tried to get feedback there. 
* I personally found the chat feedback to be very difficult, although I think TwistedGears was helpful.
* I did find forum feedback to be more helpful, but I understand that my experience is nearly the opposite of what many successful writers here feel. 
* I think that an important part of feedback is recognizing what is helpful and what isn't. Everyone means well, but some advice isn't very useful. I wouldn't have posted this if I had taken //all// the advice (someone thought it was too similar to the robot in //Hyperion// to ever work, someone else thought that there shouldn't ever be any more articles with birds in them, for example). 
* Professor Will suggested I change my footnotes into Bibcites (because I was referencing fictional journal articles for versimiltude). I did so, but as far as I can tell I am the only writer to do this on the wiki. Usually fake journals are just footnotes. I think he was right though and will probably use bibcite again for fake bibliographic citations. 

+++ Posting
* I read through it several times. I should have done a search/replace for "SPC" and "XXXX" but I didn't. I highly recommend that you do this prior to posting! 
* I was very nervous as I carefully followed the instructions in How to Write an SCP and posted it. 
* I tried to get my author post done before anybody else got there but was ninja'd. 
* I was initially very dismayed by the reaction. However it turns out that those first few posters were outliers. It nownow has, I think 58 upvotes and only three downvotes. 
* I tried to respond to critique in the discussion as rapidly and tactfully as I could. Unfortunately I feel like I became somewhat more argumentive than I wanted to. I don't think that I communicate very well when I don't understand what someone is trying to say. In particular, I am afraid,  I still don't really understand what Tiam Kiara or Adam Grey wanted me to do. I would like to improve on my ability to respond to critique that I don't understand. 
* One thing that changed due in response to critique in the discussion thread was the addition of the footnote about normal shrike behavior. This has the odd effect of giving my article both footnotes and bibcites, which TL333s, [[footnote]] Whose feedback at this stage was extremely helpful.[[/footnote]] at least, found weird but I don't know if there's anything to do about that.

As a general thought about your first article, that certainly was very much in my mind at the time and that I haven't really seen articulated elsewhere:

Ideally the author's identity should be irrelevant to voting, but realistically readers have more patience with familiar authors. If you want to try something expiremental or unusual, or something that requires a lot of thought to unravel,  or even just perceived as difficult (humanoids, Keters, format screws, Thaumiel, etc.) it is probably a good idea to do something simpler first and try to establish yourself. Otherwise you may very well post something that is quite good, but never given any chance to succeed.

[[tab SCP-2890 "Magic Certainly"]]
I've long found the song "Frosty the Snowman" to have a horror element that nobody else seems to see. Many people seem to think that the //snowman// was magical but the song is really about the //hat//. "There must have been some magic in that old top hat they found". What kind of magic animates humanoid simulacra? What kind of magician uses immortality to hang around children? What if the song was based on suppressed memories of real events? 

This article had a very difficult birth. During critique, I added a lot of material in order to try to answer questions that in hindsight I probably should have left unanswered. There originally was a supplemental page called "LAVENDER CIRCLE" that detailed the Foundations attempts to find the origin and purpose of the artifact. I ended up self-deleting that (and so far that is the only page of mine to be deleted) and paired down the article almost to how it started before I got any feedback at all.

There's also the question of where the Foundation gets children for experiments. I took the suggestion that they sometimes source D-Class from refugee communities and ran with it. After all, it would be even worse to just take the parents and leave the children alone in some displaced persons camp, right?

I'm not really happy with how this article turned out, and I may try to rewrite it someday. Although it is just successful enough that I'm afraid to mess with it.

[[tab SCP-2673 "The Hunter in Words"]]
There was a failed SCP that appeared to be poetic, but was probably only accidentally so, which inspired me to write about a kind of info-life monster that could only be imprisoned in poetry. I thought about poets who died young (and I really wish I could have worked Keats in there, maybe I'll put him in the containment log eventually) and Marlowe immediately sprang to mind, which suggested the link to [[[SCP-2264]]].

As I started writing I realized that this is a perfect excuse for [[[SCP-2673 Containment Maintenance Log| a collaborative log.]]] Between the lethal kill trigger poem, the containment sonnet, the description, and the first three poems of the containment log, I ended up writing six poems for this article.

It wasn't easy to write a long poem in iambic pentameter with a complex rhyme scheme that //also// was a coherent SCP description with all the usual checkpoints. Some of the liberties I took with scansion seem to have been too much for some readers. If anybody wants to point out the parts where the meter fails totally for them, I'm happy to try and fix it.

I wasn't really aware of the really very similar haiku article, at the time. I'm not sure if I would have written this in that case.

[[tab SCP-2631 "Standard Containment Planet"]]
This is a rewrite of [[*user daveyoufool]]'s original SCP-2631. I was watching the original fail, and offering suggestions on how to save it and had a fairly good idea of what a rewrite would look like when it went to deletion. I kept dave's original title "Cruciform Snare" as a codename in this version. I felt it had a very poetic golden-age-of-science-fiction quality that needed to be retained. This article has multiple K-Class scenarios which is pretty cool, I think. 

I tried to make this as hard-ish SF an object as this form allows. I am pretty pleased with the results. 

In the discussion page I made a lengthy post with case-by-case analysis of the effectiveness of of the 99-Tripurantaka protocol (//Tripurantaka// by the way is the four-armed avatar of Shiva that destroyed the Asura's sky fortresses in Rig Vedic myth), and it was pretty nifty so I'll reproduce it here:

> Let us assume that the following are true:
> * The preconditions for a 99-Tripurantaka event is a Keter level object at the verge of a K-Class scenario with potential interstellar consequences. 
> * The array's first response is containment either via nanobots or something more esoteric (like the 1987 experiment). 
> * The planet cracker relativistic impact is a worst case destruction failsafe. 
> 
> The purpose of 99-Tripurantaka is both to neutralize SCP-2631 and prevent the triggering k-class event. 
> 
> The following scenarios may occur:
> [[collapsible show="+ Case-by-case analysis" hideLocation="both"]]
> +++ Case I
> **99-Tripurantaka:** Not Deployed
> **Array Containment:**Deployed/Fails
> **Array Destruct:** Deployed/Success
> **Triggering Keter:** Survives/Escapes
> **Result:** Planetary XK event caused by relativistic impact. Keter Object is freed for larger scale K-Class event. 
> **Notes:** Worst case scenario.
> ------
> +++ Case II
> **99-Tripurantaka:** Not Deployed
> **Array Containment:**Deployed/Fails
> **Array Destruct:** Deployed/Fails
> **Triggering Keter:**  Survives/Escapes 
> **Result:** Planetary XK event followed by larger scale K-Class scenario, both caused by Keter object. 
> **Notes:** Net result identical to Case I. 
> ------
> +++ Case III
> **99-Tripurantaka:** Not Deployed
> **Array Containment:**Deployed/Fails
> **Array Destruct:** Deployed/Success
> **Triggering Keter:**  Destroyed
> **Result:** Planetary XK event caused by relativistic impact.
> **Notes:** We are extinct but at least the galaxy is safe. 
> ------
> +++ Case IV
> **99-Tripurantaka:** Not Deployed
> **Array Containment:**Deployed/Succeeds 
> **Array Destruct:** Not Deployed
> **Triggering Keter:**  Contained by Array
> **Result:** Potential catastrophic restructuring or extinction of human civilization. 
> **Notes:** May be survivable but this is unknowable.  In an eariler draft I had a memo discussing treating this as a potential Thaumiel. Eskobar pointed out this is like a plan to have a bully punch you in the face to kill a spider on your nose. 
> ------
> +++ Case V
> **99-Tripurantaka:** Deployed/Fails 
> **Array Containment:**Deployed/ As Cases I-IV. 
> **Array Destruct:** As Cases I-IV. 
> **Triggering Keter:**  As Cases I-IV. 
> **Result:** As Cases I-IV. 
> **Notes:** As Cases I-IV. Given the vast gulf in technology and resources this is probably the most likely outcome of a 99-Tripurantaka deployment. 
> ------
> +++ Case VI
> **99-Tripurantaka:** Deployed/Succeeds only in destroying the array. 
> **Array Containment:** Destroyed by Foundation 
> **Array Destruct:** Deployed/As Cases I-III.
> **Triggering Keter:**  As Cases I-III.
> **Result:** As Cases I-III. 
> **Notes:** As Cases I-III. All outcomes result in human extinction. 
> ------
> +++ Case VII
> **99-Tripurantaka:** Deployed/Succeeds both in destroying the array, and containing/destroying/neutralizing  the Keter.
> **Array Containment:** Destroyed by Foundation 
> **Array Destruct:** Not Deployed or Deployed/Fails 
> **Triggering Keter:**  Contained (or Neutralized/Destroyed) by human action. 
> **Result:** Humanity survives with mitigated damage. 
> **Notes:** Probable best case post-deployment scenario. This is the one that communicating with the other organizations helps the most with. 
> ------
> +++ Case VIII
> **99-Tripurantaka:** Deployed/Succeeds both in destroying the array, and containing/destroying/neutralizing  the Keter.
> **Array Containment:** Destroyed by Foundation 
> **Array Destruct:** Deployed/Succeeds
> **Triggering Keter:**  Contained (or Neutralized/Destroyed) by human action. 
> **Result:** XK scenario due to relativistic impact. 
> **Notes:** Ironic extinction event. This could result from the aliens being unable to recall the impactor after destruction of the array or from punishing us for destroying it. Or just too-late containment after the point of no return. 
> ------
> +++ Case IX
> **99-Tripurantaka:** Not Deployed or Deployed/Fails
> **Array Containment:**Deployed/Fails or only partially succeeds.
> **Array Destruct:** Deployed/Fails 
> **Triggering Keter:** Causes less than full scale event. 
> **Result:** Human civilization badly damaged but species survives. 
> **Notes:** Post apocalypse scenario. This one also benefits from warning the other organizations. Least likely scenario as the impactor probably won't just miss.
> [[/collapsible]]
>
> As you can see, if it gets to this point there really aren't any //good// options. Much better to control the Keter before anything else happens. 
> 
> Of course if any of the initial assumptions about the aliens motives or capabilities are wrong, then this whole line of reasoning may be fatally misguided.

[[tab SCP-2140 "Retroconverter"]]
This was my entry into the "Short Works Contest". I was listening to the story [http://escapepod.org/2015/06/01/ep494-the-retgun/ "The Retgun"] by Tim Pratt on EscapePod while driving to a work site. I started thinking about an SCP that retroactively recruits people into the Foundation and probably inspired by the Ken Hite's **//[http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/madnessdossier/ GURPS Horror: The Madness Dossier]//** the idea for a glyph that does this when you look at, being re-purposed from a civilization on the other side of an ontoclysm (which of course simply had to be the Daevites) was born. 

I originally started outlining this as a //very long// piece, but it wasn't really working. Most of the material would have logically been quite boring to read. Then I saw the contest and decided to see if I could make it work at 500 words or less.

As far as I can tell, I now have the shortest Thaumiel (and I'm glad I didn't actually check to see how few Thaumiels there actually are; I may have been too intimidated to try this). 

There seems to be quite a few people that wanted a longer treatment, and I may add some supplementary material if I can figure out how to make it work.
[[/tab]]
[[tab SCP-2523 "Goblin Market"]]
This is a rewrite of [[*user Foamfollower]]'s original SCP-2523 "Halloween Store". I had commented something along the lines of "There's probably something you can do with seasonal Halloween stores, but this isn't quite it." and when the article got to deletion range, I decided to walk the walk if I was going to talk the talk. 

There's a few different things going on here:
* I have long been fascinated by the Gaelic belief that on Samhain (the festival from sunset Oct. 31st to sunset Nov. 1st that marks the end of summer (brighter half) and winter (darker half) of the two season Gaelic calendar) the gates to the Otherworld open. This belief is the origin of most of the North American Halloween tradition (including costumes, jack o' lanterns and trick-or-treating). 
* There's a Scottish Highlands folktale about an annual invasion of our world by goblins that is stopped by a local hero.
* The fairly recent phenomenon of seasonal Halloween stores that rent empty storefronts or parking lots for the month of October struck me as a very liminal kind of place, with this almost dreamlike ephemeral existence. Much like the kind of places that are associated with faerie activity in the folklore of Great Britain and Ireland. 
* "Stores" and "goblins" immediately suggested a "Goblin Market". Which brings us to Christina Rossetti's poem, [http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/174262 "Goblin Market"] (link is to full text at the Poetry Foundation) which is the primary inspiration for the piece.
* I am often struck by the notion that retail chain's uniform presentation means that it would be difficult or impossible to determine what store you are in from the inside, and that they could be the same store. 
* I've long toyed with a cosmology for faeries that has time as a spatial dimension in the Otherworld which is split between the dominating geography of summer and winter. This probably stems from combining Gaelic pagan ideas of a two part year, and the Otherworld as //Tír na nÓg//, the "Land of Youth" which is characterized as a timeless paradisaical afterlife with the more modern notion of a summer and winter court of Faerie corresponding with Seelie and Unseelie sidhe respectively. In this cosmology "goblins" are a race of free faeries that live in the liminal zone between summer and winter (neither of which are very free or nice places) and who serve as traders, mercenaries, and a political buffer zone between the two polar powers (similarly the tribes of helper fairies dwell on the spring border).
* The idea behind the apparent unevenness of the trades, was that the goblins aren't considering (or capable of considering) what //we// consider valuable. Rather their trade value back in the Otherworld is based on the value that the person making the sacrifice personally held the object or quality. The mother who traded her child, actually traded "motherhood", which she did not personally value to a great degree. The child is fine, by the way, he is being raised back in the Land of Youth as a member of the goblin tribe (as they will always adopt the lost and abandoned who wander into their realm) while the abstract quality of motherhood is traded for other goods. 
* Ray Bradbury's //The Halloween Tree// was my favorite book as child, and it was hugely influential on me. There's a reference hidden the article.
* For the goblin interview, I borrowed the most famous goblin in English literature, Robin Goodfellow.

This is (as I write this) now tied for the highest rated thing I have yet written with [[[SCP-2323]] "Sentinel Butcher". Which tells me that people either like it when I end in a "-23" or when I write about fairies (probably the latter). 

[[*user Kalinin]]'s critique of this piece, cogently covers all of the negative criticism for the piece, I think, "The interview doesn't really work for me. I don't find that it adds much to the narrative, and all it really does when I read it is reinforce this "tra la la oh you delightful human folk" tone that once again sounds like a mischievous faerie from central casting."  

I think that I generally agree that I was lazy with with the Robin Goodfellow interview. I could have not leaned so heavily on faerie tropes there, and written him with a more contemporary voice. I think that I'm unlikely to change it now, as it is generally so well received, though. I will try to remember this for future work.

[[tab Collaborative Stuff]]
I contributed short-short stories to [[[and-then-i-died3| And Then I Died... Part III]]]. Rounds four, ten, sixteen and seventeen are mine. Round sixteen answers MacLeod's challenge before he issued it and round seventeen is supposed to be pretty good.

I contributed a useless perpetual motion machine of the third kind to the [[[Log of Anomalous Items]]].  I'm not happy with it, it's far too wordy, and I am continually surprised it hasn't been cut. I may try to rewrite it. 

I contributed instance 03-192, the radiator system, to [[[2722tech| Document 2722-मा-7A, Recovered Materials]]]. This is, I think, the best thing I have added to any collaboration here, so far.
