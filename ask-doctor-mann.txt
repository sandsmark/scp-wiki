**"Papa Mann, my next door neighbor has a creepy boyfriend that comes over fairly often, and the combination of stupidity and nausea he radiates is destroying my will to live and bothering the cat.  Any ideas?"  --Creeped Out in Calamazoo**

Have you considered that this poor fellow might have a problem?  Many people seem disturbing, but quite often there's nothing wrong with them that drug-enhanced electro-shock conditioning can't cure.  In rare cases, direct neurosurgical intervention may be necessary.  Consult your neurologist before making any incisions.

**"Where am I?" --Concerned in Laboratory 14**

Strapped to a table in my laboratory.

**"Who are you?" --Still Concerned in Laboratory 14**

Doctor Everett Mann, surgeon and researcher.

**"What are you doing here?" --Very Concerned, Actually, in Laboratory 14**

Operating on you.

**"What's this syringe doing in my foot?" --Growing More Concerned by the Minute in Laboratory 14**

Sedating you in three, two, one...

**"Where do babies come from?" --Naive in New York**

Well, you see, Naive, when a mommy and daddy love each other very much, they're kidnapped by black helicopters and transported to Site 84, where they're rendered down into their contituent tissues. Their reproductive organs are harvested and used to create a zygote inside of a test-tube. It's grown in a vat of nutrients until it's ready (four to nine months, depending on the necessity of organ integrity), at which point it's used for whatever experiment requires babies.

**"Is dropping me into a general processing pit via a previously hidden trap door in the floor upon demotion to D-class really necessary?" --Falling Fast in Site 23**

No, but really, who doesn't enjoy a good laugh now and then?

**"Is there porn here?" --Licentious in Laboratory 14**

Do anatomical diagrams count?

**"How long does it take to make the perfect al dente pasta?" --Hungry in the Site 23 Kitchen**

Anywhere from around 13.6 to 13.9 billion years (for the purpose of inventing the universe), plus 7-10 minutes depending on the amount.

**"Dr. Mann, why won't the Foundation let me use my own personal firearm?" --Second Amended in Site 23**

Because nerf munitions are insufficient against all known enemy groups except the Revolutionary Guard.

**"Dear Dr. Mann, since my arrival at Site-023 I've learned that you are Director of Human Resources and a respected member of Site-023. How would you suggest I go about encouraging cooperation among our peers? They've been terribly belligerent despite my best efforts."-Distressed About D-Class**

Dear Distressed, I find that it helps to remove the part of their brain that allows them to be uncooperative.

**"Dear Dr. Mann, what should I do about this ukelele in my living quarters? I'm certain that it belongs to somebody else, but it's certainly a very nice instrument." --Curious in Cell 23.**

Curious, have you ever considered suicide?  It may be helpful in your situation.

**"Dear Dr. Mann, shouldn't you be working on project Beta 12 right now?" -Pondering Pressing The Button, Three Floors Up**

I am working on Project Beta 12.  That's why the potatoes in the cafeteria taste different now.

**"Dear Dr. Mann, what are your views on the sovereign debt crisis in the European Union? Please be concise." - Foundation News at Eleven**

I blame the decline of proper, well-maintained facial hair in the general public.  It leads to degeneracy and general lack of moral fiber.

**"Dear Dr. Mann, what is your view on the so-called 'Serpent's Hand'? Do serpents really have hands? How does that even make sense?" - Susurrus from Site Sixty**

These long-haired recalcitrants oppose the natural order of progress.  They believe themselves enlightened but are unwilling to make the sacrifices necessary for mankind to take its next step into the cosmos.  Their bleeding-heart philosophy combined with their guerrilla tactics make them dangerous.  As to the handiness of serpents, I maintain that while it is a well-known feature of the suborder Serpentes, it is by no means an essential one.  A point my snake-men will make at the next Herpetology Super Expo.  This year, I shall not be denied!

**"Dear Dr. Mann, what's up with teenagers these days?  Why are they so wierd?" - Curmudgeonly in California**

There are a number of theories, but perhaps the most likely is malevolent control by the Chaos Insurgency.  Knowing full well that the battle of the future will take place in the hearts and minds of our youth, they've prepared the battlefield by sprinkling their nihilistic propaganda into the media.  This has twisted their minds, turning them from once-happy children into something dark and unrecognizable.

Well, it's that or their dratted rock-and-roll music that they seem to fancy.  One or the other.

**"Dear Dr. Mann, could we potentially use the [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-167 labyrinth] to store Euclid but immobile SCP's?" - Amazed in Anchorage**

The proposal was briefly considered, but ultimately cut because of twine shortfalls in the budget.
