Blue lily chains provide minor warding effects and are a symbol of good luck and friendship to those on good terms with fae. A popular variant of classic faerie chains, blue lily chains were created by Serpent's Hand members[[footnote]] See //Watanabe et al// "Developing an educational fairy chain for fun and profit".[[/footnote]] using Library-sourced techniques. These chains are often created by students of the preternatural as an exercise in imbuing items with aetheric qualities.

**Traits:** Blue lily chains have a number of small magical effects: 
~ They use the strength of interpersonal relationships to keep negative emotions out of whatever room they're in[[footnote]]Note this is only a 'helper' effect, it only helps if you want it to or don't mind; an outright mind control effect would be taken very seriously![[/footnote]]
~ They allow a user minor protection when traveling faerie paths
~ If hung in direct sunlight, they protect against many fae-affiliated spirits, so long as there is daylight
~ They provide minor protection against physical and spiritual harm[[footnote]]If you're thinking in percentages, think around 5%, you roleplaying game fanatic, you. Don't try to rely on these above serious magical techniques. Oh, and don't festoon yourself with these to try "min max", that's just embarrassing. Not to mention that the effect will be lessened for the insult. Children these days... --RR[[/footnote]]
~ Miscellaneous minor protective wards (may be customized by the user)[[footnote]] I use mine to keep wasps out of my hair! Jay~ [[/footnote]]

**Nature:** Blue lily chains are specially attuned to the crafter, and their friends, family, and romantic partners. The effects of the chains are stronger when given to someone the crafter or custodian cares about.

Like all objects of faerie origin, blue lily chains have an element of caprice, especially around faeries themselves. Lily chains respond to the wearer's mood and the mood of the others around them and causing the effects to fluctuate (though usually in positive ways). Be sure to stay on good terms with fae, otherwise the chains may stop or reverse their effects[[footnote]] A 5% reduction in good feelings is terrible, you feel every percentage lost. [[/footnote]]. If stolen, the chains will not work for the thief. [[footnote]]When woven with certain crafting techniques, the chains may even cause minor harm to the thief, or work as a distant focus for certain effects.[[/footnote]]

The use of blue lilies in these faerie chains has a particular occult significance to the original developers, which shall not be noted here[[footnote]] Aside from us noting that we aren't noting it. Gotta preserve the mystery. [[/footnote]].

**History & Associated Parties:** This particular style of faerie chain was developed by Serpent's Hand members, which makes these chains potent sympathetic magic tools for members of the Hand. Faerie chains in general have a long history -- it's said that the first were created when the first humans met the first faeries in friendship, in time immemorial. 

**Approach:** Blue lily chains are considered "Steadfast" in Loyalty[[footnote]]Loyalty terms proposed by Z.S.[[/footnote]], because their effects will only manifest for a single individual, and must be passed on willingly to transfer the effect. The chains can be passed only to someone the custodian cares about, or has at least some sympathy for.[[footnote]]For example, they can be used to provide minor protection for someone you don't really know, but like or sympathize with.[[/footnote]] Only the crafter can pass on the blue lily chains the first time.

To benefit from the effects of the chains, hang them as decorations in a stationary area that has meaning to you -- such as within your home, a favorite social location, or even a place outside your home where you sleep. You can also use them to decorate something that is portable, especially if living.[[footnote]]The example in the illustration above uses a much-loved potted plant as an expert example.[[/footnote]] Some people in the Library bring blue-lily-chain-decorated plants with them to reading rooms. You can also wear them on your person, as a bracelet or circlet or necklace.

A small cluster of fairy chains can provide an exponentially useful effect, though wearing too many of them on your person will not provide much benefit.

The only way these chains can be dangerous is if you intentionally upset a fae. So don't do that. (Well, just don't do it. Is there really any reason to upset a fae on purpose?[[footnote]] Yes there is. See "The Impact of Fairy Jinxes on Pork Futures" by E.B. White for starters.[[/footnote]])

**Other Detail:** Similar chains and garlands are used across the world, with or without magical connotations -- though, more may have this significance than are remembered by those using them.

Within the Hand, these are sometimes used to mark people or locations that are trusted. Remember, though, don't turn off your brain just because magical symbolism walks into a room...

**Observations & Stories**
[[/=]]

See "Faerie Fire" and "Never Servants, Walkers In Light" for a great deal of excellent information on the history and usage of faerie chains.

For more general history of humans and fae, "The History of Men on Mundus"[[footnote]]Yes, "Men" instead of "Humanity" or "People". It's an old title written by crappy monks. What can we say? It's alliterative at least, I guess. --Iris J.[[/footnote]] is a good place to start. A recent popular alternative is "Children of Light, Children of Dust"[[footnote]]"The Children of Light" references fae, particularly faeries (partly as the terms are often used interchangeably in classic as well as recent texts); "The Children of Dust" references humans. Old, traditional names.[[/footnote]], by Abigail Jackson of the Association of Wanderers.[[footnote]]Third Chapter, Violet Lantern Waystation, Los Angeles, California.[[/footnote]]

> A note on the possible upper potential of faerie chain use: It is said that when Grandmaster Leafless Lei Zhao's hut was robbed by New Nicene thieves ten years ago, she used her blue lily chains as a focus to twist their hideout in on itself until it opened to the night air, allowing Grandmaster Zhao to properly perform a locator spell. As Grandmaster Zhao is ever unfailingly polite, she even fixed the twisted limbs of the thieves before turning them into the authorities. However, Grandmaster Zhao has not confirmed or denied these claims, and will repeatedly request to be brought chocolate raspberry tea when questioned about that incident. (Which is her response to most requests from people who can't take a hint.) -- Zatta Sounding Song[[footnote]]Not the Z.S. who wrote the metaphorical book on Apparatuses! I guess I'd be Z.S.S.? I'm not sure why signing off with initials is so popular.[[/footnote]]

//I see it falls to me to say it: I'm not certain we should be encouraging these to be made by so many students. It's improper. Additionally, anything that carries the effect of a "ward of protection" tends to be relied on excessively by the foolish. -- RR//

//My complaint is simpler: must we bear such excess focus on the "aesthetically pleasing" magical creations? Shamble-crafting is just as useful a practice for prospective thaumotologists. This will simply lead to excessive conflation of 'magic' with 'beauty', not to mention encouraging too many of the frivolous to partake in our ancient art. --S.D.N.//

//Jesus, is all this really such a bad thing? If the "frivolous" want to be "thaumotologists", is that really such an issue? You guys. --Iris J.//

> Listen. Do you all know what you're dealing with? These little... quilting parties of yours? This goes against the very heart and soul of magic. Once mage practitioners were all about esoterica, about mystery, hidden knowledge, about puzzles for the worthy to prove themselves. Gnosis should come at a steep price, always. These... children, weaving your fairy chains... they are in and of themselves an insult to the Spirit of Magic. If you plan to throw the gates wide open, you had best be prepared to deal with the cherubim with their flaming swords. //--Unsigned//

//Just ignore the old fogey occulists, guys. We may be stuck with the ones not human enough to join up with Big Brother -- that's the Global Occult Coalition, to those of you just joining us -- but that doesn't mean we have to listen to them. We're the Serpent's Hand. We're about spreading knowledge, not hiding it. --Iris J.//

//Do not pretend we are an ideological monolith. Not all under the Serpent's Banner support this agenda of the normalization of the ineffable. --Tsagadar Raven-Eye//

//Oh, yeah, because the whole Garden thing would've worked SO much better if the Serpent decided to hand over the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil __if and only if__ Eve could travel through all of the First Nine Worlds, complete a diary about her pilgrimage through the Ravelwoods, solve a series of logic puzzles and get three Ph.D.s in navel gazing. Would that be enough to satisfy you, oh High Mage of the Raven Eye? --Sier N.//

//You all know that's the Serpent thing is a metaphor, right? It didn't really happen? It's part of a (fictional) Biblical story? --Jack Peterson III//

//...okay I'm suddenly thinking Raven-Eye has a point. We should kick Jack Peterson III out of the Library. And probably Jack Petersons I and II with him. Something all sides can agree on! --Sier N.//

//Jack Peterson III: The very fact that you are asking that question shows your basic lack of knowledge. Is this your first day in the Library, little whelp? You are a symptom of a cancer too great to be expressed in these small words.//
//Regardless, this conversation is beneath my status. I shall not be further contributing. --Tsagadar Raven-Eye// 

//In response to Iris J.: We're not about hiding knowledge unless we have to be, I should point out. There's a time and a season for everything and for everything a time and a season, if you'll pardon me butchering Ecclesiastes. --M*.//

//There was a time when you would not go up the misty mountain nor down into the glen for fear of offending the many little men. Now your cities are old, your people grow too bold and all that's for us are the little lily chains. 
Your arguments offend, and here they must now end. Cease your bickering. Stop the fight. Turn off the computer and turn out the light. 
 Did ye forget that we were abandoned when the Christians came? The treaty-bond withers without the chains. If you abandon the fae when we are extinct you'll have yourselves to blame.--Ps. Bsm.//
