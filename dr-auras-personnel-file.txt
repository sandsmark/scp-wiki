**Security Clearance:** Level 2

**Duties:** Xenoveterinarian, Habitat Consultant for Safe/Euclid Animal SCPs

**Location:** Based at Site-17, though travels where needed.

**History:** Born in ██████, Ireland in 19██, Aura came the attention of the Foundation during the discovery of SCP-███ which had been brought to her veterinary clinic in █████. She had already assessed its unusual differences, contained the animal and provided a full list of habitat requirements and dietary recommendations to the containment team upon their arrival. Her evaluation upon employment has noted her as 'Friendly, open-minded with one hell of a stubborn streak especially where her work is concerned'. She has also been noted to be incredibly trusting of the Foundation staff in general, though whether that is a good or bad thing remains yet to be seen. 

Aura works on the principle that even though an SCP animal may need containment, a good habitat may make them less likely to attempt containment breach.

**Additional Notes:** "Can you please stop asking me to look at SCPs that are objects made to look like animals? I deal with the flesh and blood creatures, not ones made of bullets or trees." - Dr. Aura
