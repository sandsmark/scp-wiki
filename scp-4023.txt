**Item #:** SCP-4023-2

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4023-2 is to be stored at Site-91, in a standard Safe-class-object container and can only be accessed by personnel with Level 4 Security Clearance and higher. Object can only be accessed for testing purposes.

**Description:** SCP-4023-2 is a musical album by an unknown artist titled "Judgement". Album consists of 23 tracks. Most of these tracks resemble white noise, scratching on wall or static. When played, each track has a different anomalous effect on the listener as detailed below.

**Addendum:** Most notable tracks:
|| **Track**  || **Name** || **Effect** ||   
|| Track 01 || "Traitor" || Listening to this track for longer than 10 seconds will cause the listener to abruptly lose control over their body and proceed to assault any nearby beings they previously had friendly or acquaintance relationship with. Effect lasts indefinitely. ||
|| Track 04 || "Snake" || Anyone listening to this track for longer than 1 minute becomes incapable of speech and instead starts making noises similar to hissing. Effect of Track 04 is a memetic virus. Affected individuals proceed to involuntarily infect others by hearing. Effect lasts indefinitely. ||
|| Track 07 || "Regret" || Subject's listening to this track will find themselves lost in their thoughts, rethinking their past decisions. Track 07 has been shown to counter the effects of Track 01. Effects lasts two hours. ||
|| Track 10 || "Fake Heroes" || Individuals who listen to this track will cut all ties with their friends and associates. They will often claim that they "have seen through their lies". Effect lasts indefinitely. ||
|| Track 11 || "Sins are not forgotten" || Listening to this track causes affected individuals to suddenly remember every wrong done to them in their life. Effect lasts indefinitely. ||
|| Track 13 || "Betrayal" || The effect of Track 13 seems to be similar to the one of Track 01 but more aggressive. Counter effect from Track 07 is not effective in countering the effect of Track 13. Effect lasts indefinitely. ||
|| Track 14 || "Redemption" || If any individual affected by any other track apologizes during listening to Track 14, the negative effects will disappear. Only exception is effect from Track 13. ||
|| Track 18 [[span style="color:black; background-color: black"]]2nd of March 2023[[/span]] || "Return" || It is currently impossible to play this track. The significance of the attached date is unknown. ||
|| Track 19 || "Released" || Individuals affected become increasingly obsessive about a certain object, eventually stopping all of their activity except the activity regarding said object. Effect lasts indefinitely. ||

**Item #:** SCP-4023-3

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4023-3 is to be watered twice per day via overhead mister. Should the mister break for any reason, attendants should water SCP-4023-3 by hand until it has been fixed. Attendants watering SCP-4023-3 by hand and maintenance personnel fixing mister must be blindfolded before and are to perform this action completely blind as to not risk exposure to the cognitohazardous effects of SCP-4023-3.

**Description:** SCP-4023-3 is for all uses and by all means an oak tree planted in an enclosed atrium at Foundation Site-11. Persons directly perceiving SCP-4023-3 are affected by a cognitohazard residing in the treetop. As of writing this document, 10 out of 23 branches of SCP-4023-3 are dead, with the remaining 13 alive and without any sign of damage.

**Addendum:** Interview 4023-3

> **Interviewed:** Class-D, exposed to SCP-4023-3 without a blindfold
> 
> **Interviewer:** Dr. Ike
> 
> **Foreword:** It was required during a routine maintenance that SCP-4023-3 be watered manually. Assigned Class-D individual took of his blindfold during this task and was exposed to the cognitohazardous effects of SCP-4023-3.

[[/=]]

**Item #:** SCP-4023-5

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4023-5 currently resides in an enclosed pen near Site-0 and is to be provided with food, water, bedding, grooming, and veterinary care. Stables of SCP-4023-5 are to be cleaned daily. 

**Description:** SCP-4023-5 is a herd of 13 anomalous //Equus ferus caballus//[[footnote]] Domesticated horses [[/footnote]] of various breeds. 

Anomalous properties of SCP-4023-5 manifest, when anyone attempts to ride one of the instances, upon which every individual in the herd turns to face the rider and starts running towards him and do not stop until they reach their destination. When all 12 horses reach the location of the rider alongside the instance that is saddled, they all merge with it into one. In this form, SCP-4023-5 is capable of reaching speeds up to 200 kilometers per hour, is more resilient and capable of being commanded telepatically by its rider. In addition, rider is also capable of ordering SCP-4023-5 to split back into individual horses with each instance removed weakening the powers of SCP-4023-5.

**Addendum:** On █/██/20██ an accidental exposure of multiple simultaneous riders has shown that when SCP-4023-5 merges into one while multiple individual instances are saddled, riders also merge into one being. This state has been described by all three persons involved as confusing. It would appear that SCP-4023-5 merges bodies of its riders into one but their minds remain separate and fighting for control. Exposure concluded after 9 minutes, when one of the riders managed to order SCP-4023-5 to split, which divided the riders back into their own bodies. Further study required.

**Addendum:** As of ██/██/20██ all testing regarding SCP-4023-5 has been discontinued by order of the O5 Council.

**Item #:** SCP-4023-6

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Self contained within this file.

**Description:** SCP-4023-6 is a memetic hazard causing those who know about its effects symptoms to develop these symptoms in 23.3% of recorded cases.

Individuals affected by SCP-4023-6 become increasingly obsessed with number 23 and by extension SCP-4023. This obsession goes through multiple stages described below.

* Immediately after exposure - Subject finds number 23 interesting
* Few hours after exposure - Subject starts noticing number 23 more frequently in prices, numerical orders, telephone numbers etc.
* Few days after exposure - Subject starts noticing their obsession but dismisses it as number 23 being more frequent than other numbers
* Week after exposure - Subject starts searching information about number 23, in case of Foundation personnel, begins to obsess about SCP-4023 and other SCP objects involving number 23
* Two weeks after exposure - Subject starts forming possible explanations as to why they notice number 23 more often
* Three weeks after exposure - Subject starts noticing number 23 in places here no such number exists, start noticing numbers 32, 2, 3 and equations which equal 23, //e.g. 13 + 10 = 23//
* Month after exposure - Most subjects claim they are being followed by number 23 and claim to encounter it everywhere in their surroundings.
* From this point onward, obsessions become stronger but do not change symptoms.

**Description:** SCP-4023-7 is a set of 9 rusted steel keys of unknown making, which have been in the possession of Site-62 for --at least one week-- --two months-- --5 years-- an unknown period of time. At first it has been theorised that SCP-4023-7 is connected to on-site [[[SCP-004]]], however this idea was rejected after the initial experiment in which all of the 9 keys from SCP-4023-7 failed to open SCP-004-1.

No lock capable of being unlocked by any key from SCP-4023-7 has been discovered as of writing this document with the exception of [DATA EXPUNGED].

**Item #:** SCP-4023-8

**Object Class:** Neutralized

**Special Containment Procedures:** Remains of SCP-4023-8 are to be stored in a low priority secure container at Site-[REDACTED] for further investigation into it's nature.

**Description:** SCP-4023-8 was at some point in the past a vaguely reptilian creature of unknown origin presumed to be the [REDACTED]. SCP-4023-8 resembled a long serpent with thick scales similar to those of modern day crocodiles. Full length of SCP-4023-8 is speculated to have been around 11 metres, however the remaining skeleton after its neutralization is only 2,5 metres long.

SCP-4023-8 was a Type Green reality bending anomaly, capable of small but hard to notice changes to surroundings of its prey. It would seemingly change its appearance, try to lure humans closer and devour them whole once they got close enough. However, this behaviour was observed only if the creature was hungry. SCP-4023-8 was a highly intelligent and manipulative creature capable of speech and would often interact in this way with personnel of Site-[REDACTED]. It was found that SCP-4023-8 found great pleasure in discussions with Foundation researchers and was very polite yet intrusive during interviews.

Age of SCP-4023-8 is currently unknown, however it claimed to be older than humanity. Even though SCP-4023-8 was cooperative during interviews, it always tried to negotiate its release from Foundation custody or special privileges in exchange for knowledge it possessed. These exchanges were strictly forbidden by order of the O5 Council.

**Addendum:** On ██/██/19██, SCP-4023-8 escaped from its cell at Site-[REDACTED] during a massive containment breach of multiple SCP objects. It was found later that this breach was caused by Agent █████ who claimed to have been persuaded to this action by SCP-4023X-8.

**Addendum:** 3 months after the containment breach at Site-[REDACTED], Foundation agents found the dead body of SCP-4023X-8 approximately 23 kilometers from Site-[REDACTED]. Cause of death was multiple gunshots into the head and body of subject aswell as [DATA EXPUNGED]. Intrusion by Global Occult Coalition confirmed.


**Addendum:** Interview conducted with Foundation Dr.[[span style="color:black; background-color: black"]]Alto[[/span]] [[span style="color:black; background-color: black"]]Clef[[/span]], formerly known as GOC Agent [[span style="color:black; background-color: black"]]Ukulele[[/span]], responsible for death of SCP-4023-8.

> 
> **Dr.[[span style="color:black; background-color: black"]]Clef[[/span]]:** Well, it was a cold day. I remember that. Me and my partner were sent into the woods, because one of the Foundation's pet escaped and we, the Coalition, had a chance to take it down before you would catch it. We knew it was a bixby but no one at the command told me it was a snake, hell maybe they didn't even know... So, we went into the woods and found it, like we were trained to do. We got lucky this time, it didn't see us.
> 
> But than, something weird happened. I am used to reality bends just as I was back then and I am telling you, something else happened there. I don't remember the fight, next thing after we spot it... It was laying there, bleeding to death. And I don't blame amnestics for this one.

It looked me straight in the eyes and started laughing. And than...

**Item #:** SCP-4023-11

**Object Class:** Euclid 

**Special Containment Procedures:** All 9 instances of SCP-4023-11 are to be housed separately and are not to come into contact with each other unless necessary. Instances that can be reintegrated into Foundation society can do so after extensive psychological evaluation and reintegration program, if they desire to. Hostile or questionable instances must stay in their cells and will be further questioned about their nature.

**Description:** SCP-4023-11 is a designation of 9 humans from alternative universes, which manifested in our universe through unknown means. These humans have nothing in common and appear to have been chosen randomly. Only thing that connects all of them is the fact that they have previous knowledge of the anomalous and died in their universe during an incident related to SCP-4023.

All instances of SCP-4023-11 appeared at once on 9/9/1999 in an empty cell at Site-23. Everyone materialised unconscious and naked. On site security managed to separate all instances and fully analyze the situation before instances woke up. This happened at once approximately 23 hours later.

**Addendum:** Most notable instances

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** All personnel working with SCP-4023-12 is to be reminded that SCP-4023-12 are on the same intelligence level as a wild animal and will not hesitate to attack. All instances of SCP-4023-12 are to be housed separately in secure containment cells without windows.

**Description:** SCP-4023-12 is a human 1,5 metres tall with grey skin, no bodily hair, 23 blue human eyes and 23 fingers[[footnote]] 3 additional fingers can be found on subject's face, resembling small tentacles [[/footnote]]. SCP-4023-12 does not possess any higher brain functions and attempts to attack any humans it sees. Every person who sees SCP-4023-12 is instantly affected by a cognitohazardous effect compelling them to get closer, however this effect can be overcomed if the subject is concentrating, and especially if the subject knows about this effect.

Upon contact with skin of SCP-4023-12 subject's body begins transforming into another instance of SCP-4023-12. As of writing this article, Foundation houses 9 instances of SCP-4023-12.

**Discovery:** Original instance of SCP-4023-12 was found in the same containment cell as instances of SCP-4023-11, however it manifested exactly 23 minutes later and fully conscious. 6 members of on site security were converted to SCP-4023-12 before the situation was handled. Testing soon showed cognitohazardous effects and containment procedures were developed. Origin of SCP-4023-12 is still unknown but it is suggested that ███████ may be the point of its origin.

**SCP-4023-15 is an O5's tale.**

Good morning, Doctor.

Yes, me again. You would think that after all this time, we would both get used to this. I can see from your face that you are just as uncomfortable with this as I am. But chitchat is not why I am here. It has come to my attention and to the attention of the Council, that you have been dragged into the Investigation of 4023. Now, I know that you and I share a lot of secrets Everett and we really should have expected you being dragged into it.

But I never told you about 4023, all these secrets and I omitted this one. So let me tell you about number 23 and about its significance to the O5 Council.

Yes we try to keep it a secret.

Yes it was our mistake.

As you already know from our previous conversations, we started this foundation slowly but surely, me and my men... My loyal 12. That wasn't always the case. We discovered that 13 didn't cut it for us. 13 was a bad number, unlucky, or at least some of us believed that. Plus our organisation grew bigger by the day and some of us thought that we might need a bigger council to control it. This was the first attempt at this. Before the Administrators, before Site Directors and even Alpha-1. Before all of that we had the O6 Council.

They were supposed to be there as a support to us, taking care of the things we couldn't when there was too much work to do. In retrospective it was a horrible idea but back then it worked. Selected from people we trusted, people that were with us almost from the beginning, capable men and women. And for a while they did exactly what we expected them to do. In a sense, they helped us more at the time than we are able to admit. Without their help at the early days when we were still learning, we could have been unprepared when it came to the Insurgency many years later.

Anyhow, it worked. Until the anomaly. Even back then there were many things we underestimated, you might remember some cases from my other stories. Well, we definitely underestimated number 23. It was a small anomaly, made you think the number was stalking you everywhere you go, nothing to stress about. You might get where this is going. It was passed to the O6s. I know I like to compare us today to us back then but we didn't know anything about memetic properties or cognitohazards. Turns out this was one.

The entire O6 Council got infected with a meme and started obsessing over the anomaly. Over all of them. Everything with number 23 in it. That's how we discovered many things that are still in our possession today including parts of 4023 but I'll get to that. 

The poor people were relentless about it. Even tried to convince us about it. Mel kept telling me about this eldritch creature from another dimension that sends these anomalies here, that it is trying to get into our dimension using these numbers as anchors. It didn't exactly help that this was entirely possible in our lives. But we didn't see it that way. To us they all just started going crazy from overworking and coincidences.

So our relationships started to stagnate. We let them do their jobs that they still performed excellently and they stopped trying to get us on board with their theories. We should have seen it. Now I know it is our fault but I cannot help myself but blame that reptile. It was around that time when we captured something bigger. The O6 had their number but we... We obsessed over a snake. It claimed to have many secrets and was willing to give them to us. How could we not try to find out?

We tried but it never actually said anything worth noting. On the other hand, we told it everything.  For a lot of us in the Council, he became a friend. No one noticed how manipulative it was. We would talk a lot and sometimes, our conversations would shift their focus. We complained to him about the O6s and we would do it often. I am very glad that thing is dead actually. Knew me better than I did myself.
So for a long while we didn't have any problems with the O6 Council and we didn't care what they did as long as they did their job. Coincidentally they didn't do that anymore.

And then they showed up on our meeting one day. Said they need help. At this point we were all angry at them for abandoning their intended purpose and they were angry at us because... Well, we didn't believe them. That evening was very unprofessional for all of us. Word exchange was fine even if vulgar at parts but the reason for cutting the meeting short was a fist fight that broke out. That was the breaking point. They begged us for help with their crazy crusade but we kicked them out of the room and out of our organisation. All that was left was the paperwork. Everyone who remained in that room settled on waiting until the next meeting.

But as it turns out, they were right. Something about the number may have driven them crazy but it was also dangerous. That evening they took of from Site-Alpha on horsebacks and disappeared. This opened our eyes a little and we saw the snake for what it was. By the time of another meeting we already had our minds clear but it was too late. The O6 Council was gone. Disappeared from the surface of Earth.

We all agreed that we should investigate their disappearance. We owed them at least that. And would you know it, the more we dug into it, the more number 23 appeared. We found their research and we were terrified. I cannot discuss everything but there were many anomalies and events that were corrupted by this curse. And it all led to a date. 2nd of March, 2023. I am afraid that we are approaching this date at light speed my friend and if the rest of their research is something to go by... Well, let's not worry about that. We have enough end of the world predictions as it is.

Oh, the research? We hid it, destroyed it alongside all the evidence of the O6 ever existing, some of us feared that even the knowledge could be affected by the number. We still don't know what exactly it is. A curse? Bad luck? An alien being? Maybe all. I hope we don't have to find out.

What? No, we never had 23 members. The O5 Council has and always had 13 and the O6 had 9. That is 22 and I am glad it stayed that way.

Why am I telling you this? Everett, I told you many stories. Why this one? Well, the Council does not want anyone to know. Doctor Ike seems to be hitting a rock bottom with the investigation and you are the only person who can give him the information he needs. Don't worry about the Council. Yes? Let's just say that I am still regretting the decision we made all those years ago.

**Item #:** SCP-4023-18 

**Object Class:** Apollyon [[footnote]] Classification is based on current evidence and is a subject to change. [[/footnote]]

**Special Containment Procedures:** There is currently no method of containing SCP-4023-18. All information regarding the development of containment procedures is restricted to Security Clearance Level 6/4023.

**Description:** SCP-4023-18 is a presumed extradimensional entity seeking to enter our dimension on 2/3/2023. No information on appearance or motives of SCP-4023-18 exist and should some be found, they must be immediately passed to Dr. Ike.

First evidence of SCP-4023-18's existence were recorded by a Foundation internal organ known as the O6 Council. The Council has performed extensive research regarding SCP-4023 and managed to discover a malicious entity in its core. The O6 Council tried to reason with their superiors at the Overseer Council about an immediate action regarding SCP-4023-18 but were denied.

The O6 Council left Site-Alpha to investigate an anomaly which turned out to be a portal leading to another dimension. It is believed that SCP-4023-18 was creating anomalies related to number 23 in our world to gain strength and enter our dimension through this portal. The O6 Council made an unanimous decision to enter the portal and attempt to close it from the other side. Their attempt was succesful and caused a local temporal anomaly blocking the entry. This anomaly is currently contained as SCP-4023-14.

Fate of the members of the O6 Council is unknown but anomalies related to SCP-4023 found since this event are more personal in nature. Multiple related anomalies seem to reference the O5 Council, specifically blaming them for the fate of the O6. Due to this, it is believed that the O6 Council has joined with the entity.

**Addendum:** Status of Investigation, SCP-4023 by Dr. Ike

> I have successfully managed to tie more than enough anomalies to our theories to confirm that SCP-4023-18 is indeed real.

> SCP-4023-1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21 and 22 all seem to be either products or anomalies related to SCP-4023-18.

> SCP-4023-5, 8 and Document 4023-15 are related to SCP-4023's discovery.

> However, I was unable to find any connection between SCP-4023-18, SCP-4023-7 and SCP-4023-11. Myself.
> 
> Dr. Nakayama, whose help I requested, was however able to notice another pattern of numbers in SCP-4023. Most dominant number in all parts of SCP-4023 is 23 but the second most dominant is 9. The O6 Council had 9 members, SCP-4023-11 has 9 instances, me included. SCP-4023-7 consists of 9 keys. The significance of this is as of yet unknown. Further information on devised containment procedures will be restricted to a higher level of clearance.

**Description:** SCP-4023-23 will be upon its completion a machine capable of transporting up to 9 persons from separate alternate universes into our own on 9/9/1999 to create a temporal bootstrap paradox.

SCP-4023-23 is designed to be operated using 9 steel keys inserted into the device at once by 9 individual operators designated O6-1 through 9.

Using SCP-4023-23 to bring 9 individuals from alternate universes involved in operating aswell as construction of SCP-4023-23 should cause a local bootstrap paradox which should be able to negate any local entries from other dimensions into our own. Location for this Project was chosen based on the first appearance of the 9 members further proving the effectiveness of this paradox.

**Item #:** SCP-4023

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Access of SCP-4023 into our dimension is to be stopped by any means necessary. Multiple plans have been devised for this intention including Project Thaumiel-4023 (detailed in Document-4023-23) and Project Command Overseer-4023 (detailed in Addendum 4023-1).

**Description:** SCP-4023 is a malicious entity trying to enter our dimension using anomalies and numerals. Intention of SCP-4023 after entering our dimension is to merge with the O5 Council and enter a state of completion in which the entity will consist of 23 connected parts. SCP-4023 currently consists of 10 components: itself and 9 members of the original O6 Council. Entity appears to be obsessed with numbers, specifically number 23.

**Addendum 4023-1: Project Command Overseer-4023**

Thanks to already existing containment procedures for related anomalies to SCP-4023, specifically SCP-4023-10, Project Command Overseer-4023 has been devised.

//Hypothesis: If number 23 is the state of completion for SCP-4023, it will be unable to create further anomalies in our dimension after the number of existing anomalies reaches 23.//

Based on this, several false documents were created in the original document for SCP-4023, either describing a non anomalous object or were simply expunged.

//Hypothesis: If Foundation High Command consists of 23 members, it enters a state of completion and SCP-4023 will be unable to merge with the O5 Council.//

Based on this, the position of Administrator as well as the O6 Council have been reinstated in the Foundation High Command.
