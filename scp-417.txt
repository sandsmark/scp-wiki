**Item #:** SCP-417

**Object Class:** Euclid (Potentially Keter)

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to SCP-417's inability to be moved safely, SCP-417 remains stationary in █████████████████. A square mile, with SCP-417 at the center, is fenced off with a simple chain-link fence with barbed wire looped at the top, and guards patrolling. The cover story is that a small village with an incredibly virulent plague resides within', and must be protected until further notice. Not too far from the truth. Trespassers are to be shot on sight, and only Class D personnel are allowed to handle and work with SCP-417 directly. Since wild animals seem to have an instinctive fear of SCP-417, no action should be taken against animals seen in the enclosed area.

All victims bitten by SCP-417-1 may request that they be killed immediately out of mercy, and their body is to be placed in a sealed container and cremated immediately. Those that do not request, will have the same immediate termination, except in the case of test subjects.

**Description:** SCP-417 resembles an african baobab tree in general size and structure, and lacks leaves, giving it a dead appearance. That, a well as it's drab, off-colored bark contribute towards it's strange atmosphere, as well as the fact that although lacking leaves, SCP-417 bares fruit every sundown. Small buds form as the sun rises, and this fruit grows and matures quickly over the course of the day, before ripening into pomegranate-sized, hard-husked fruit with dark purple-black skin and a mostly smooth texture that grows pebbly as the fruit becomes over-ripe. This hard husk may be cut or peeled away by hand or with tools.

However, peeling or cutting away the skin only reveals that there is not truly fruit or pulp underneath. Rather, the interior of the husk is hollow...and filled with bugs, collectively known as SCP-417-1. Not true insects nor any other known species of invertebrate, every time a fruit is opened, the bugs contained within seem to be different from any other that have emerged (See addendum for list of tests and results). Similarly, the size and number of bugs varies. SCP-417-1 behaves like a extraordinarily violent group of bugs. SCP-417-1 will swarm and attack anything that moves with startlingly painful bites.

Bites, within' the first few minutes, swell into painful red lumps with small puncture wounds that can bleed on the top of them. No known remedy will sooth the pain of the bites. In a rare 5% of the time, bites have no lasting effect and the swelling and pain leaves after a few days. However, in another 45% of the time, those bitten will begin to have convulsions and suffer from a fatal heart attack within' several hours, dropping where they stand. Their body rots and dissolves at an accelerated rate and a new plague tree begins to grow over the course of the next few days. While growing, plague trees are vulnerable to being cut down, fire, and conventional herbicides. And in the remaining 50% of the time, after an indeterminate period of 2-24 hours, those bitten begin to complain of severe pains, muscle weakness, and collapse before approximately their own mass in the same bugs that had attacked them is released from their bodies, having devoured them from the inside-out.

SCP-417 cannot be moved, as all attempts to cut down or shift the tree result in the branches shaking and fruit, in all stages, falling to the ground and releasing massive swarms of SCP-417-1. Thankfully, SCP-417-1 does not seem to survive for longer than an hour or two after being released, and dies quietly and quickly. If the fruit of SCP-417 is not picked or shaken off the branches, it simply rots on the branches and falls to the ground like any other rotten fruit, with no ill effects.

**Addendum:** Although SCP-417 is currently listed as a Euclid class item, the potential it has for spreading has sparked some argument over whether or not it should be moved to Keter class.

**SCP-417-1** Notable specimens- 
001 - Several dozen creatures resembling black widow spiders, except with only four long, cricket-like legs each that allowed for them to make astonishingly long, fast jumps.

002 - A score of wasps with red and orange stripes, and wings similar to those of a butterfly, capable of surprisingly fast flight.

008 - A single black millipede, five meters long, curled into a ball inside the fruit.

015 - Thousands of tiny fruit-fly like creatures that emitted a high-pitched buzzing and has uncharacteristically painful bites for such a small size.
