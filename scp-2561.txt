**Item #:** SCP-2561

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2561 is to be contained in a 2.5m x 1.5m x 2m enclosure constructed from FM radio frequency (VHF) deflecting material within Site-15. Unauthorized electrical conductive material, electrical instruments, and any type of audio transmitters must be kept outside the enclosure to avoid outside VHF interception from the specimen. While inside SCP-2561's enclosure, all personnel are required to wear high-frequency noise cancelling earmuffs. One portable FM radio is to be placed inside the enclosure next to an audio-recording device. The device must be recording at all times, and the radio must be tuned into frequency 169.695 MHz. Researchers are to playback audio recordings bi-weekly to listen for any requests from the specimen to communicate with personnel.

**Description:** Physically, SCP-2561 has the body and limb structure of an emaciated Domestic Shorthair cat (//Felis Catus//). Its furred torso is white while its front and hind legs are dark grey in color. Its entire head and face are in the form of a vintage television set complete with "rabbit ear" antennae. A large white eye with a single black pupil is displayed on the television screen which overlaps colored SMPTE bars. The specimen has no visible mouth, nose or ears. However, it does respond to auditory stimuli, indicating some sort of hearing capabilities. SCP-2561 possesses a tail superficially resembling a standard two-prong power cord measuring approximately 80cm. The specimen does not need sleep or sustenance to function normally. SCP-2561's behavior shares a likeness to the typical behavior of the average house cat; displaying traits of curiosity, skittishness, and spontaneity.

SCP-2561 has the anomalous ability to emit, receive, and store VHF frequencies within a radius of 20km through its antennae. These broadcasts reach all FM radios within a 20km radius of the specimen. All frequencies emitted from the specimen are in the form of slightly distorted voices and music. SCP-2561 appears to be sapient and capable of limited speech via broadcasting words and speech clips from various radio broadcasts from the 1940's through 1960's era. Using these speech excerpts, the specimen forms sentences to communicate. When it is not attempting to communicate with another being, it broadcasts songs, radio shows, or it talks to itself.

**Addendum 2561-01:** SCP-2561 was originally captured by MTF-██ on █/█/20██ while walking along an interstate highway next to the ███████  █████ Nature Reserve in  ████████, OR. Prior to SCP-2561's containment, the local humane society was alerted by residents that an abused stray cat was wandering in the wooded areas of the small town. Alongside these sightings were reports of FM radio interference in the general area. The interferences, witnesses said, were described as "Eerie garbled voices and classical music". The sounds would slowly fade in–interrupting scheduled broadcasts–and remain at a level volume for 1-5 minutes before slowly fading back into normal broadcasting. There were also a few reports of radio interruptions that only consisted of extremely loud high-pitched frequencies. The noise was observed to reach an inexplicable decibel level of 90 dB, regardless of the radio's maximum volume limit. These interruptions lasted 5-10 minutes and inflicted painful cases of tinnitus to those listening.

**Update   █/█/20██**
While observing SCP-2561's behavior on █/█/20██[[footnote]]Exactly two days after containment[[/footnote]], researchers noted a transmission from the specimen in which it seemed to request communication with a figure of authority within Site-15. Upon hearing the transmission, researchers promptly scheduled an interview with the specimen.

Below is a transcript of a recorded interview with SCP-2561. SCP-2561's responses were received via transmission through the interviewer's FM radio.

**Interviewer:** Researcher/2561 Dr. G. ████
**Interviewed:** SCP-2561
**Foreword:** SCP-2561 was seen pacing back and forth around its enclosure. When the interview began, SCP-2561 was the first to speak, displaying a sign of eagerness to communicate.

> 
> **SCP-2561:** "...I promise you..."
> 
> **Dr. ████:** "Those frequencies are sealed off so you can't receive any more transmissions as of right now. We first want to understand what you are before we let you take in more information."

> 
> **SCP-2561:** "...Loss of freedom...I'm better off alone..."

> **Dr. ████:** //(hesitant)// "Alright...this interview is over."
> 
> **<END LOG>**

**Closing Statement:** "After I ended the interview and left the observation booth, the specimen proceeded to broadcast Billie Holiday's //"Gloomy Sunday"//. The broadcast repeated itself for roughly two hours before ceasing. My ears are still ringing from that...noise. If we ever interview the specimen again, we need to take extra precaution to protect our ears from being blown off our heads."
