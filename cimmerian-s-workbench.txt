++ New Images Enforcement Procedures

+++ New Images Enforcement

Images posted to articles after February 24th, 2017 must be brought into compliance with the site's images policy. The following guide will take you through the process for ensuring all new images are in compliance with the site's license.

This page will be updated as needed over time. It is not entirely comprehensive and if you come across an article containing an image that was both posted after February 24th, 2017 and contains either no source or an invalid source, you should enforce as appropriate.

The listed articles prior to February 24th, 2017 are not enforced under this guide's procedures. Do not enforce them utilizing this guide. 

One you click through to an article you must first determine if it is validly sourced.

++++ Section 1: Checking listed sources for validity.

A validly sourced image meets three criteria:

# The image must have a source posted on the discussion page of the article using the image.
# That image source must list the image as being under a Creative Commons License **or** having been released by the image's creator for use on the wiki **or** that the image has entered the public domain.
# The image's creative commons license does not contain a No Derivatives clause.

As of this posting 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0 variations of the creative commons license are compliant with the site's license.

Additionally there are 4 possible elements in any creative commons license. 

# ShareAlike (SA)
# Attribution (BY)
# NonCommercial (NC)
# NoDerivatives (ND) **Reminder: This is the only element that is strictly incompatible with our site license and content.**

Assuming the image source meets the above criteria you may change the page's tag from _image to _cc. This is true even if the image is not under a creative commons license. The _cc tag denotes compliance with the site license only. Removal of the _image tag will also remove it from the workbench page linked above.

//Note:// Oftentimes users will link directly to the image and not the licensing information page. In those cases, assuming there is a parent page with licensing information, you'll need to find it for them. Utilizing the image's filename in google is generally sufficient to get you the parent page. If for some reason you cannot do this, treat the image as unsourced, but explain to the user why and how to remedy the issue.

++++ Section 2: Unsourced or invalidly sourced images.

Any image used in an article that provides no source or a non-compliant source must be processed according to our previously agreed upon methods. This includes the following steps:

* Post on the discussion page of the article in question. We have some boilerplate for this: 

[[code]]Images used in posted articles must comply with the site's [http://www.scp-wiki.net/image-use-policy image policy]. One or more images on this article are non-compliant with that policy and has been removed. A source must be provided on the discussion page and the source must be compatible with the [http://www.scp-wiki.net/licensing-guide site's license]. The author will be notified after this posting via Wikidot PM. Please do not read the image until you have a source and list it in this discussion thread.[[/code]]

* You must send a wikidot PM to the author of the article linking them to the discussion page post you've created at the same time you post the timer. You can repeat the above information if you'd like.

* Before posting or sending a PM, be mindful of the context of the individual situation. If the user has posted an invalid source, say so. If they've provided a source but you can't get any license information out of it, say so. If there is anything out of the ordinary about the situation beyond not posting a source at all, **say so**. If they reply and ask for help, help them as much as you can. Our ultimate goal here is not the removal of the image but rather proper sourcing.

* You are to edit the image block code out of the page. **Do not delete the image file itself.** 

If the user adds the image back to the page without properly sourcing it and it's not a misunderstanding on their part, you should contact a member of the disciplinary team for assistance.
