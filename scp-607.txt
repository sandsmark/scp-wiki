**Item #:** SCP-607

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:**
Subject currently resides with agent  █████, who it has chosen as its' "owner". Both agent █████ and subject are to be placed under full surveilance for study, and agent █████ is to report to Dr. █████ for psychiatric evaluation every two weeks. A mobile task force should be ready at all times with at least one (1) D-class personnel on hand for subject to "imprint" on in the case of its' death or that of agent █████. No other containment seems necissary at this time.

**Description:**
Subject is a large grey male American Shorthair cat of indeterminate age named "Dorian". Subject's behavior and feeding patterns are consistent with a normal cat of its' breed, wit an apparent preferance for 'Fancy Feast' brand cat food. However, unlike normal cats, Subject seems incapable of dying of natural causes. This capability appears to be transferred to its' owner, as well, with the addition of protectig the owner fom various types of harm. This seems to render the owner effectively immortal, with the exception of the death of SCP-607. Should the cat be killed for any reason, the owner will also die insantly. Subject appears to be aware of this, and has attempted self termination multiple times when bonded with an abusive owner. Exactly five minutes after death, Subject will reanimate, and begin to heal. Subject will "imprint" on the first human it encounters after reanimation, choosing them as its' new "owner". Research on the reasons behind the 'immortality' is underway, due to its' obvious uses. 

**Addendum:**
In addition to self terminating due to abusive owners, the cat seems to delight in putting itself into danger at seemingly random intervals. It's jumped into traffic twice in the last few months, and video shows that █████'s taking good care of it. Poor guy, he's at the mercy of a cat.       -Dr. ███████
