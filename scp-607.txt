**Item #:** SCP-607

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Subject currently resides with Agent  █████, who it has chosen as its "owner". Both Agent █████ and SCP-607 are to be placed under full surveilance for study, and Agent █████ is to report to Dr. █████ for psychiatric evaluation every two weeks. A task force should be ready at all times with at least one (1) D-class personnel on hand for subject to "imprint" on in the case of its death or that of Agent █████. No other containment seems necessary at this time.

**Description:** SCP-607 is a large grey male American Shorthair cat of indeterminate age named "Dorian". Its behavior and feeding patterns are consistent with a normal cat of its age and breed, with an apparent preference for 'Fancy Feast' brand cat food. However, unlike normal cats, SCP-607 seems incapable of dying of natural causes. This effect appears to be transferred to its "owner" as well, with the addition of protecting the "owner" fom various types of harm. This seems to render the owner effectively "immortal", with the exception of the death of SCP-607. Should SCP-607 be killed for any reason, the owner will also die instantly. SCP-607 appears to be aware of this, and has attempted self termination multiple times when bonded with an abusive owner. Exactly five minutes after death, SCP-607 will reanimate, and begin to heal. SCP-607 will "imprint" on the first human it encounters after reanimation, choosing them as its new "owner". Research on the source of the "immortality" is underway, due to its potential for use. 

**Addendum:**
In addition to self terminating due to abusive "owners", the cat seems to delight in putting itself into danger at seemingly random intervals. It's jumped into traffic twice in the last few months, and video shows that █████'s taking good care of it. Poor guy, he's at the mercy of a cat.       -Dr. ███████
