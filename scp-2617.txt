**Item #:** SCP-2617

**Object Class:** Safe 

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to its fixed location, Containment Area-57 is to be established to contain SCP-2617 on-site. The perimeter around SCP-2617 is to be fenced in via chain link fence and mounted with eight surveillance cameras. Activation of SCP-2617 is prohibited. Each unique instance of SCP-2617-B is to be kept in Storage Unit 5 at Area-57. 

**Description:** SCP-2617 is a 100 m tall radio tower situated in Sverdlovsk Oblast, Russia, and is controlled by a built-in electro-mechanical computer. The computer possesses a numeric dial, intended for inputting geographic coordinates. The central processing unit for SCP-2617 is a bio-mechanical analytical engine constructed from the brain tissue of Eugene Ivanoff, a Russian exile based in Bydgoszcz, Poland who disappeared in 1928. 

When SCP-2617 is switched on, geographic coordinates may be inputted. If valid coordinates [[footnote]] Defined as coordinates that correspond to territories within the Russian Federation; previously the USSR until 26 December 1991. [[/footnote]] are inputted, an encrypted radio transmission is sent out and SCP-2617-(A-C) will begin manifestation in the designated site.  

SCP-2617-A refers to a collection of humanoid statues, which are constructed out of ice. All instances of SCP-2617-A are featureless, and are physically identical to one another. About 100 such instances are manifested for every minute SCP-2617 remains activated. Once manifested, they will proceed to attack all belligerents [[footnote]] Defined as one who is part of a foreign military entity with intentions to conquer a Russian political entity. [[/footnote]] in the vicinity. When no belligerent is present in the vicinity, SCP-2617-A instances typically move towards the location of SCP-2617. 

SCP-2617-A instances are capable of autonomous movement, travelling at an average velocity of 1.2 km/h. They typically display high levels of coordination with one another, despite having no identifiable means of communication. They also have no difficulty in orientation, despite lacking sensory organs such as eyes and ears. 

SCP-2617-B refers to an assortment of weapons, operated by SCP-2617-A instances. They are similarly constructed out of ice, and are 1:1 scale replicas of weapons fielded by contemporary Soviet and Russian militaries. All instances of SCP-2617-A are armed with at least one instance of SCP-2617-B when manifested. The functionality of SCP-2617-B instances is comparable to respective non-anomalous counterparts, despite unknown means to propel ammunition. Below is an abridged list of SCP-2617-B instances.

SCP-2617-C is a nimbus cloud formed over the designated site, precipitating ice crystals. The precipitation of ice crystals is utilised by SCP-2617-A and SCP-2617-B for regeneration, using them to repair broken portions. These ice crystals are also used as 'ammunition' for SCP-2617-B instances that possess a gun component. 

SCP-2617-A and SCP-2617-B instances that are outside SCP-2617-C are unable to regenerate, although they retain their solid phase at room temperature. When outside the borders of the Russian Federation, they will undergo sublimation. [[footnote]] Prior to 26 December 1991, sublimation occurs outside borders of the USSR. [[/footnote]] Incineration is also capable of terminating instances of SCP-2617-A and SCP-2617-B. 

The Foundation was first aware of SCP-2617 after its deployment by the USSR during the winter of 1941. Despite official denial by the Soviet leadership, evidence from the //Wehrmacht// and Foundation intelligence have verified the existence of SCP-2617. Below is a translated transcript from the //Wehrmacht//, mentioning instances of SCP-2617-A in the Eastern Front.

> The enemy continues to pursue us, as though they do not need sleep. Their bodies are not of flesh, but of ice. Our bullets could not stop them. They do not negotiate. They only slaughter. 

Between 1941 to 1943, there have been about ██ reported manifestations of SCP-2617-(A-C) within the USSR. As SCP-2617 was then under GRU-P control, containment was initially not possible. That said, intelligence was able to pinpoint the GRU-P facility where SCP-2617 is held at. 

On ██/██/1992, a recovery team was dispatched to the GRU-P facility and SCP-2617 was successfully secured without incident. The facility was found to have been abandoned. 

**Addendum 2617-1:** Despite its discovery in 1941, historic accounts have suggested that SCP-2617 had been active since the 18th century. Said accounts describe entities speculated to be instances of SCP-2617-A. Below are translated excerpts from //The Chronicles of the Tsars//, a book authored by members of the Tsar's Seers. [[footnote]] A Foundation precursor active from mid 16th century to late 19th century, its sphere of influence includes the Russian Empire, Eastern Europe and Northern Asia. [[/footnote]]

> And Tsar Peter commanded the //Grigori// to strike against the Caroleans. And the //Grigori// obeyed, enveloping the land and seas in ice. A mighty host of warriors was unleashed upon the Caroleans, each of them a warrior carved in ice. 

> Upon Tsar Alexander's command, the //Grigori// obeyed and a mighty host of warriors descended upon the land. Under the veil of winter, the host of carved soldiers cast themselves upon the Great Army of many nations. And like the Caroleans before then, ice and death await them. 

**Addendum 2617-2:** Due to a suspected connection between SCP-2617 and the //"Grigori"// entity, Father Mikhail [[footnote]] A former member of the Tsar's Seers, he later served as a Level 1 consultant on Imperial Russian affairs for the Foundation. [[/footnote]] was called in for the following interview. 

[[collapsible show="+ View Interview Log-2617-FM-1" hide="- Hide Interview"]]
> **Interviewed:** Father Mikhail
> 
> **Interviewer:** Agent Ivan Braginsky 
> 
> **Foreword:** Fr. Mikhail was shown Addendum 2617-1. The following interview is originally conducted in Russian. 
> 
> **<Begin Log>** 
> 
> **Agent Braginsky:** Please explain the Seers' involvement with the //Grigori// entity described in these excerpts.
> 
> **Fr. Mikhail:** To be brief, we were the ones who had found it and sealed it.
> 
> **Agent Braginsky:** Sealed it?
> 
> **Fr. Mikhail:** To be precise, it's a pact, but we have to seal it. A being of such power would only cause unnecessary destruction in its true form, so its essence was dispersed into fragments in the sky. Through a ritual, these fragments would coalesce at our call and reform as an army of soldiers. Not as strong as it could be, but easier to control. 
> 
> **Agent Braginsky:** And the entity is a willing participant? 
> 
> **Fr. Mikhail:** Of course. It wishes to regain the favour of God, and we wish for protection. It's a mutual agreement.
> 
> **Agent Braginsky:** Based on the excerpts, the entity was weaponised by your organisation. Could you elaborate on them?
> 
> **Fr. Mikhail:** Please do not be mistaken, agent. Our pact with the //Grigori// is very specific. It is meant only to defend Russia against foreign invaders, nothing else. 
> 
> **Agent Braginsky:** Given its use in Russia's defence, who else knew about the entity's existence or its applications?
> 
> **Fr. Mikhail:** Like all that is written in the Chronicles, they are exclusive to our sect alone... until we've allowed your group to view its contents, of course.
> 
> **Agent Braginsky:** Father, would you please take a look at these?
> 
> [Agent Braginsky hands Fr. Mikhail a collection of photographs of SCP-2617-A recovered from field agents.]
> 
> **Agent Braginsky:** These were intercepted from the //Wehrmacht// in the Eastern Front. We currently believe that the //Grigori// entity is the cause of these ambushes. 
> 
> **Fr. Mikhail:** It certainly matches the illustrations and the context is appropriate, but unlikely. The Bolsheviks shouldn't be able to.  
> 
> **Agent Braginsky:** Why not?
> 
> **Fr. Mikhail:** Even if they knew that the //Grigori// exists and what it could do, they could not summon it. This ritual requires a Tsar, a Tsar they had murdered.  
> 
> **Agent Braginsky:** Does the late Tsar have any knowledge pertaining to this ritual or anomaly? 
> 
> **Fr. Mikhail:** No, the Tsar is only the conduit for the ritual. He is a symbol of God's authority on Earth, and symbolism is everything to a ritual. With the //Grigori// disconnected from God and His Word, the Tsar as God's proxy is the best alternative. That's why a Tsar must always reign and rule.

**Addendum 2617-4:** According to intelligence reports, on ██/██/1943, about █,███ instances of SCP-2617-A are reported to be converging towards the location of SCP-2617. A Red Army battalion has intercepted them near the village of ███████, USSR, and successfully terminated all known instances via incendiary weapons. Moscow blamed the resultant damage on a German-led assault on the village.

Since ██/██/1943, no further manifestation of SCP-2617-(A-C) has been identified.

**Addendum 2617-5:** GRU Profile on Eugene Ivanoff. Majority of the original document is rendered illegible.
