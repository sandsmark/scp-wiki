//(Submitted 2:48 AM 27 Aug 2008)//

As we are likely to forget seeing this Image, a number of us approached it with the blessing of Ezekiel, so that we might remember our interactions with it, and its answers to our questions. We could each feel frustration from the Image when we were conversing. 

We offer only description of this Image and do not suggest it is divine - only in its presence on Earth, as all things are.

Ah. This is a fantastic Image. It is very nice to look at. I love to, look at it. Please update the page with the conversations with the Image. I would love to read them as much as I love looking at this Image. Is it possible I can get the images in blue? For my web site. 

I lost my train of thought. I was thinking about what I was going to make for dinner. Tonight. I don't think that the Image is an angel. But that's not important. I want to understand what it means. What does it mean in the "big picture". It might not be important. I might just let you all forget about this. 

For now, I don't believe anything, but I have a few deep suspicions. 

Go with God. üôè

Ezekiel,

I am writing this letter to you as a preface to the report on our interaction with the Image. Because I am at a loss for whatever happened. When I initially responded to your letter, to travel to the retreat and begin work with the Mission, I must admit I was only amused and I needed a summer diversion. 

I don't believe what I saw. I think I was drugged. I think this is part of a hoax, or you're trying to set us up for some gag. I don't trust my colleagues. I think they're in on it. I don't know what sort of subconscious suggestion led me to this feeling, but they're in on it. Honestly, I just feel violated.

Credit where credit is due, this is masterfully executed, but I don't believe in magic. I can't believe in this.

I'm leaving the project tomorrow and I will be expecting reimbursement for my time, at the very least.

Please consider Acts 20:9-10. https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+20%3A9-10&version=NIV

In this you will find I am Eutychus, who has been found dead on the ground after his fall, only to be found alive cradled in the arms of Paul. And Eutychus forgave him. For though the manner of his speech weakened him and so caused likely his death, he forgave him and went on to listen again and again.

Go with God. üôè

Right right, Eutychus. 

Thanks for the timely response. I shared the video of the flaming arm thing at that location to some of my friends, and one of them said she could do up the whole thing in After Effects in a few hours. It's just a man with some red bloom around him.

You can expect to hear from my lawyer this week.

We just got off the plane and we're compiling all of the data from the Euphrates right now. I think what the man... Well I don't know if I should call it a "man". It is definitely something. Lets take a minute before we say it's "anomalous" though! We think that the perception of the phenomenon has to do with hallucinations caused by escaped gas from geothermal vents in the area. Again, we're still going through everything on a case by case basis based on the Expedition team's report.

I've had so much fun working at the Mission retreat. So many bright people in one place, and the nature out here is incredible. Thank you so much for the opportunity.

I was wondering Ezekiel, if you're ever going to stop by Triangle Lake? Lot's of people want to meet you. What was your address again? Is there a phone number you can be contacted at? Just any direct line would be a great help to me. Thanks so much.

Remember not to share the Pass Word for the web page. Daniel told me the whole Web page was deleted last night! Be careful with viruses! Don't click on any bad links!

Daniel had a copy saved. Of the web page. He is going to up load the video and the interview with the Image, or, what some tell me is an angel, to the page some time today. You might be surprised what the "Angel" said! Very interesting things. I loved to hear them. I am going to meditate on those words on the overlook. I will meditate on what they mean, or how they relate to Parousia.

I'm going to the store to go buy some breakfast for dinner! Daniel. I have to get going now. It's a long slog into town and I think it rained!

Go with God. üôè
