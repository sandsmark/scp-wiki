**Item #:** SCP-100-J

**Object Class:** Keter 

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-100-J is kept in a 20 by 20 meter containment structure on the bottom floor of Site 19. The structure is to be lined with plasticrete, backed up by thirteen feet of steel. Attempts to encase the SCP in telekill have met with absolutely zero success. SCP-100-J is to be kept in a plastic bucket in the middle of the containment structure. There is to be around the clock surveillance of SCP-100-J. Security on SCP-100-J is minimal at most times, needing only one guard on a rotating schedule. However, whenever a new operative joins the staff at Site 19, a security detail of at least 20 fully trained security operatives, as well as ten agents, are to be on duty outside the containment structure for seventy two hours, at which point normal security practices are to be reinstated, if no new SCP has been spawned. Should a non-sentient SCP emerge from SCP-100-J, a team of researchers is to be dispatched into the containment structure, to determine the properties of the new SCP, and to determine how best to decommission it. Should a sentient SCP emerge from SCP-100-J, Site-19 is to go on full alert, and all manpower brought to bear on containment structure. Agents Clef, Kondraki, Gears and [REDACTED] are to be immediately informed, so they can begin forming decommission strategies. Should an SCP from SCP-100-J make it past the bottom ten floors of Site-19, the onsite nuclear weapon is to be detonated.

**Description:** SCP-100-J appears to be a 42cm by 32 cm mound of equine feces. The SCP maintains a constant moistness, as well as an inner temperature of a 101 degrees Fahrenheit. 

Whenever a new operative joins Site 19, there is a seventy five percent chance that a new SCP will be spawned from SCP-100-J. There is a fifty percent chance of the new SCP being sentient.

Non-Sentient SCPs come in a variety of categories. Many are weapons, all of which bestow extraordinary abilities upon the user. The majority of such weapons are swords, with a small minority being rather ungainly modified firearms. Additional non-sentient SCPs tend to be items that either work better then they should, or work in direct opposition to the way they should.

Sentient SCPs come in two main categories. The majority of humanoid SCPs appear as idealized versions of the new operative, physically attractive, with a multitude of abilities, and tend to make people feel comfortable in their presence. Non-humanoid SCPs are usually some form of enhanced normal creature, but with bizarre coloring.
