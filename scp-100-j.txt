**Item #:** SCP-100-J

**Object Class:** Keter 

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-100-J is kept in a 20 by 20 meter containment structure on the bottom floor of Site 19. The structure is to be lined with plasticrete, backed up by thirteen feet of steel. Attempts to encase the SCP in telekill have met with absolutely zero success. SCP-100-J is to be kept in a plastic bucket in the middle of the containment structure. There is to be around the clock surveillance of SCP-100-J. Security on SCP-100-J is minimal at most times, needing only one guard on a rotating schedule. However, whenever a new operative joins the staff at Site 19, a security detail of at least 20 fully trained security operatives, as well as ten agents, are to be on duty outside the containment structure. Should a non-humanoid SCP emerge from SCP-100-J, a team of researchers is to be dispatched into the containment structure, to determine the properties of the new SCP, and to determine how best to decommission it. Should a humanoid SCP emerge from SCP-100-J, Site-19 is to go on full alert, and all manpower brought to bear on containment structure. Agents Clef, Kondraki, Gears and [REDACTED] are to be immediately informed, so they can begin forming decommission strategies. Should an SCP from SCP-100-J make it past the bottom ten floors of Site-19, the onsite nuclear weapon is to be detonated.
