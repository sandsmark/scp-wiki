**Item #:** SCP-2916

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2916-4 is to be monitored for any unusual behavior on either SCP-2916-1 or -3's part. SCP-2916-2 is to be given in-home psychological counseling by a Foundation therapist and monitored remotely for any potentially dangerous behavior. These procedures were implemented following the events of 7/29/2016.


**Description:** SCP-2916 is a phenomenon wherein the text of existing published works are changed to reflect the inclusion of three new characters or entities, designated SCP-2916 -1, -2, and -3.  

SCP-2916 instances appear in the text of a narrative as side characters that usually do not affect the plot greatly. SCP-2916 can only appear in narratives referenced by a narrative they have already appeared in, though they will sometimes enter a work by discussing their destination story in a narrative that contained no previous mention of their destination. SCP-2916 appears in 7% of all copies of infiltrated works, allowing for comparison of altered and unaltered versions of the story. After SCP-2916 has left a narrative, the changes will remain in the affected copies of the work in question.

SCP-2916 appearances follow a distinct script: SCP-2916-1 and -2 will enter the setting of a work  and express an interest in settling in without bothering the other characters. Occasional, insignificant encounters can be seen in some occupied stories, but most of the time, SCP-2916-1 and -2 maintain isolation after their initial introduction.

Seven days after the first appearance of SCP-2916-1 and -2 in a story, SCP-2916-3 will appear. SCP-2916-3 is fixated on pursuing SCP-2916-1 and -2, who will flee upon hearing of its arrival in the narrative. SCP-2916-3 will express a desire to kill SCP-2916-2, and will often command SCP-2916-1 to return home with it. SCP-2916-1 and -2 will then flee to a new narrative, with SCP-2916-3 in pursuit. There will be no further appearances of any SCP-2916 instance within the text after the confrontation. SCP-2916 -1 and -2 will then appear in a new work. SCP-2916 instances never return to a narrative once they have left. Even if all three instances leave the narrative simultaneously, SCP-2916-3 always appears seven days after SCP-2916-1 and -2, in both narrative and physical time.

[[collapsible show="Descriptions of SCP-2916 Entities"]]

SCP-2916-1 most often takes the form of a lamb, a fawn or another prey animal. A young woman has also been seen very frequently, as have other inanimate forms such as a white glove or a newly built temple. SCP-2916-1 is always female when its form allows. SCP-2916-1 is never seen unaccompanied by SCP-2916-2, and usually appears as its charge, its student, or the object of its desire. Adjectives commonly used to describe SCP-2916-1 include young, awkward, curious, childish easy-going, naive, bright, playful, cunning, and gentle. SCP-2916-1 is usually depicted with large brown eyes when its form allows for such description.

SCP-2916-2 most often takes the form of a female shepherd. However, other professions have been seen, such as a priestess, a healer, or a scholar. SCP-2916-2 is often described as Middle Eastern in ethnicity. Like SCP-2916-1, SCP-2916-2 is always female when the form allows. SCP-2916-2 appears in a human form the most frequently of all SCP-2916 instances. SCP-2916-2 often appears as a mentor or a guardian to SCP-2916-1, and when possible, privately expresses romantic feelings for her, though they are never stated directly to SCP-2916-1. It is hypothesized that this is to avoid detection by SCP-2916-3. Adjectives used to describe SCP-2916-2 include tall, stately, elegant, dignified, patient, graceful, solemn, intelligent, and proud. 

SCP-2916-3 most often takes the form of a predatory animal, or a large, malevolent man - often a hunter or warrior, or another profession involving violence. Frequently, however, SCP-2916-3 takes the form of a natural disaster, inclement weather, or other insurmountable physical obstacle. SCP-2916-3 is always male when its form allows. SCP-2916-3 is universally malevolent towards SCP-2916-2. It exhibits a possessive attitude towards SCP-2916-1, claiming to be its father. Adjectives used to describe SCP-2916-3 include looming, rough, predatory, dangerous, dark, strong, brutal, burly, scarred and jealous.

The Foundation has created a software entitled SAFE HAVEN that produces narratives allowing for communication with SCP-2916 instances. 

> **Interview with SCP-2916-1 and -3** 
> **Narrative Used:** "A Chance Encounter with a Lamb," a short story depicting Doctor Elle Ives waiting in a cafe to meet with someone she could offer shelter.
> **Added text:**
> The girl sitting across from Elle had an easy smile, but a furrow between her brows. She sat down and leaned forward across the table.
> "Well, no point wasting time. I understand you've been looking for me."
> "We're here to help you -" Elle paused. "What is your name, exactly?"
> "Here, now, it's Mattie. That was my name before. I use it whenever I can. I miss it. Not as much as I used to, though."
> "And her?" Elle tipped her head in the direction of the elegant Arabian woman sitting waiting in line. 
> "Farha," Mattie said, a hint of longing tinging her voice.
> "Something's chasing you. You and her. Something that wants to destroy her."
> "We are just not putting any effort into any kind of natural transition, are we?" Mattie said, laughing. 
> "You don't have much time."
>"Two days," she said, looking out the window anxiously. "I needed to get us settled, first, before I met with you. But yes. Wherever I go," she said, "he follows. I can tear my way into new narratives, but I can't close the gaps I leave. He's too big for most of them, and it slows him down. But I'm running from him. Always. And he can always find me."
> A song began to play from the speakers of the cafe - a rock song, Rolling Stones. It sounded audibly distorted, lower, rumbling. 
> "Wolves, children," the singer growls, "he's just a day away, he's just a day away!"
> "A day?" asked Elle. "I thought you said -"
> "No," said Mattie color draining from her face. "No no no. I have to go. Now. Farha!"
> //One day later, the following addition is made.//
> The man was burly, making the chair look comically small as he sat down across form the doctor.
> "Listen," he said, "I don't want any bullshit. The girl? She's mine. That woman, she took her from me. Made my girl some kind of whore for her. I'm taking my baby back, you hear? Don't you dare try to get in my way. I don't know what the fuck it is you're doing here, but I don't care. Just stay away from her."

Ives and SCP-2916-1 have continued to communicate via the use of SAFE HAVEN-generated narratives. SCP-2916 has expressed frustration and despair at her current predicament, and is increasingly anxious as the time between its entry into a narrative and SCP-2916-3's arrival began to grow shorter.

No progress had been made in finding a way to permanently block SCP-2916-3's entry into narratives was found, until today's exchange:

> **Interview with SCP-2916-1**
> **Narrative Used:** "Same old, same old," depicting a walk in a remote forest with Elle Ives.
> **Added text:** 
> Elle's fellow hiker grabbed her by the shoulder, a desperate look in her eyes.
> "I think I know how to contain him," Mattie said. "But I need you and your people to do two things for me." 
> "How can we help you?"
> "I need a story, and I need a painting. I need you to mention the painting in the story. And then I need you to tell her what happened to me. Why I did what I did. Because it's for her. She needs to know that. Because if she doesn't, she'll think -" Mattie paused, unable to go on. "You need to explain to her what happened. Please."
> "What's going to happen?"
> "I can't risk him knowing. But you'll see."

SCP-2916-1's requests were fulfilled. The final altercation, which took place in a narrative by Doctor Ives titled "Trick," mentioned a commissioned painting of an empty clearing, titled "Stalemate." 

> **Added text:** 
> The young lamb faced her father in the clearing.
> "Where is she," he growled, pacing restlessly.
> "I let her go, Daddy," the lamb whimpered, regressing back to a childish voice. "I - I was wrong about her. She didn't love me, not in a good way. She was hurting me and I was too scared of what would happen if I left and I couldn't see it. I'm sorry, Daddy. I...I'll come home with you."
> All hostility fell away from the black wolf's eyes, and was replaced with pride and affection. 
> "I knew you'd come back," he said, pressing his flank against the fragile sheep, "I'm never letting you go again, baby, I swear it." The lamb nuzzled her father on the underside of his muzzle.
> "You know, Daddy," the lamb said, gazing up into her father's eyes lovingly, "I've learned so much from you. But I've learned one thing that's very important."
> "What's that, dear?"
> "If you can be a wolf, so can I," she said, just before she tore out his throat. Rough wool become thick white fur and hooves turned to claws. The lamb who was now a wolf lunged through the fabric of the sky itself, and pulled her father with her, into a stalemate. And there they stayed, locked in the tenth of a tenth of a second, teeth in each other's throats.
> //End text//

After this text was altered, the painting "Stalemate," previously containing an empty clearing, now contains a black wolf and a white wolf locked in combat. The painting has since been designated SCP-2916-4.

At the same time of SCP-2916-4's creation, Farha Khan, who had been reported missing a year prior, appeared naked in her London apartment. The apartment had been emptied of all possessions save for an infiltrated copy of //Wuthering Heights//. There was a handwritten inscription on the inner binding that has been transcribed here: 

> i know what it looks like. i know what i said, before i got frozen. i didn't mean it, any of it.  i love you. i love you i love you i love you. oh, god, farha, i love you. time means everything, farha. without it we are --nothing-- --nowhere-- --everything-- --everywhere-- --dying-- --fused-- --alone-- --inseparable-- still. motionless. yet feeling everything. always. i don't have time, not anymore. you do. but he doesn't either. i'm stronger than he is. i'm young, and i have you. i'm always remembering you, again and again, as i feel his claws in me and my teeth in him. it's because of you i'm coming home. not now. but soon. home. home to you.

The handwriting matches that of Mathilda "Mattie" Lowell, Khan's domestic partner before both women went missing. All attempts to amnesticize SCP-2916-2 to protect knowledge of the Foundation and prevent further exposure of SCP-2916 have failed.
