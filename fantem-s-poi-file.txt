**POI name:** [[*user Fantem]]

**Gender:** Female

**Serial Number:** Ξ-BU66N7NY-1825

**Threat level:** 2

**Site of Operations:** Variable

**Profile:** POI "Fantem" is an uncontained, anomalous entity resembling a 1.7 m tall, humanoid variant of cryptid species 12-656 ("wolpertinger"). It is unknown whether Fantem is venomous or capable of flight, however it does possess appropriate limbs and teeth implying it is capable of both. Fantem is capable of level 2 reality bending or higher, having created or altered multiple items to possess anomalous properties, and appearing within Foundation's anomalous item storage facilities to recover multiple items linked to it.

Fantem possesses a humanoid body structure, overweight build, leporine ears and facial structure, a light brown fur coat, antlers resembling those of an adult female deer, large feathered wings, and snake-like teeth. It was spotted after the discovery of a cabin near The B█████ Strid, which had contained multiple objects with varying anomalous properties.

Fantem has stolen the majority of objects with a link to it, however, this appears to be for sentimental reasons rather than for malicious intent (see Objects Associated).

**Objects Associated:**

> Item Description: A hooded lantern, estimated 1██ years old. Object does not require a fuel source to be lit, and can burn indefinitely.
> 
> Date of Recovery: ██-██-████
> Location of Recovery: The B█████ Strid, █████████
> Current Status: Stolen, currently expected to be possessed by POI 'Fantem'.
> 
> //Notes: I still have use of this. I suppose I could make another, but I'd much rather have this one back. It was my first piece... Besides, it's not like you can't make your own.//
> 
> //~Fantem//

> Item Description: A semi-animate hand-made doll resembling a young girl. Object is composed of cloth, leaves, and leather, and appears resilient to damage. Object seems to react to positive stimulus, ie: hugging back when hugged, and "laughing" during play.
> 
> Date of Recovery: ██-██-████
> Location of Recovery: The B█████ Strid, █████████
> Current Status: Stolen, currently expected to be possessed by POI 'Fantem'.
> 
> //Notes: Thank you for getting this back... I know you didn't get it on my behalf, but... thank you.//
> 
> //~Fantem//

> Item Description: A large book labeled "The Fantem Family Story Book", estimated 1██ years old. When opened, object will spontaneously create a short story tailored for the reader or audience. All short stories appear to reference many mythologies, and focus on the drama and horror genres. If a subject has used the object before, and wishes to view a story previously viewed, it will receive that story upon opening instead of a new one. If a subject wants a specific mythology referenced in a new story, the object will create a story centering that mythology.
> 
> Date of Recovery: ██-██-████
> Location of Recovery: The B█████ Strid, █████████
> Current Status: Stolen, currently expected to be possessed by POI 'Fantem'.
> 
> //Notes: I used to read this old thing. A lot. Back when we lived together... Take good care of her for me, will you?//
> 
> //~Fantem//

> Item Description: a large herb planter. Object promotes rapid growth of any plant species planted inside it so it could be harvested within the next twenty-four hours.
> 
> Date of Recovery: ██-██-████
> Location of Recovery: The B█████ Strid, █████████
> Current Status: Site 45-C, floor 5, greenhouse #012. Currently used for growing yarrow (Achillea millefolium).
> 
> //Notes: Keep it. Consider it payment for getting my stuff for me. I used to use it for medical supplies, but I don't really need it anymore. You could probably find more use for it than I could.//
> 
> //~Fantem//

> Item Description: A child's coffin, housing the corpse of a young girl, estimated to be ten years old prior to death. When an object is placed inside the closed coffin, it preserves that object at the same state it was inserted. Surroundings suggest that the objects were buried approximately 100 years ago. The state the cadaver was found in suggests that she was placed within the coffin two hours after death. Cause of death: AD-NC-0-741 ("Wood Heart") strain.

> 
> //Notes: ... I was trying to prevent this, hence the coffin. What if something happened to her?... She left behind something beautiful though, didn't she?... She's dead, I need to move on... Keep her. She'll be safe here.//

++ __COMMENTS:__
[[collapsible show="[+] Show Document-IRL" hide="[-] Hide Document-IRL"]]
**SCP-1825:** My first SCP that stuck. 1825 was kind of a favorite number for me, so I kinda made it a point that that number would be mine. I had the idea of a pinball SCP for a while, but I didn't know where to take it. I'd have to thank Scratskinner for the help on that.

**SCP-274:** My highest rated SCP. Lots of work went into this in so many ways. Rhett helped me in making sure it was post worthy, and he was a big help on it. After some edits, it became what it is today. Will probably come back to it and organize it better soon.

**Finding The Machine:** My highest rated article on here. Working on this was a complete joy. It was part of the 2013 New Year’s Contest, under the 'Unfounded' canon, and let me tell you: Working with those guys was a joy. Clef, Photosynthetic, and Pig_catapult were all just so helpful, and fun to work with. It was a great experience all around, and I thank them for that. Us winning was just the cherry on top.

**SCP-1294:** I first posted this a while back, but it didn't go over so well. Not enough to go by… But then, like, a month after its deletion, I spontaneously said "MAKE IT A FUNGUS" while in the shower, and worked on it from there.
 
Made more sense, and I got to go into squick, which was fun, but hard not to overdo. I even watched a video of a dead fox get eaten by a fungal colony so I could describe the Fennec Fox exposure log more vividly. Pretty cool stuff… However, I realized something, which I will go into on the next one.

**This Page:** Well, one of my goals here was to work myself up enough to finally get one of these; not so much to describe my 'Nom de Plume', but to have a hub containing all the pages I've written, and an easily accessible link to my sandbox, and to give thanks to you all for writing. You guys are great, and you should feel great.
 
Looking at my SCPs and my tales, I've noticed that my tales not only rank marginally better than my SCPs, I also had a bit more fun writing them… Though granted, I only had one tale up, but it seemed that way nonetheless. It was always the tone, and my need to operate in chronological order for me, and I hypothesized that if I wrote tales, that wouldn't be much of a problem. I decided to test this, and well… I was right.

**Capone:** My favorite tale I've written. Finding the Machine was a great experience, but I think this trumps it in terms of content. I was truly inspired by [[[SCP-1471]]]. It was just a great SCP, so I just HAD to write something about it. I've always wanted to write a 'Heartwarming' article on here anyway, so I'm pretty happy that I got that goal completed as well. Also, SCP-1471-A's adorable.

**SCP-1903:** An SCP I wrote after a long hiatus. I was originally working on a tale about Unlondon, but found that it wasn't really going anywhere, so I stopped. While writing the tale, I was going through my pictures, and saw Jackie. My first reaction? Write a story about it. I let some ideas germinate for a bit. I knew it was going to be a info-hazard, I knew it wasn't going to kill you, I knew it required the bestest story I could make up for it, and I knew it was just the beginning. My best SCP, and the first step of what I hope to make.

**SCP-1913:** An SCP I wrote soon after with the idea of the Foundation seeing something that was actually chasing them. It worked with the time period, so I went with it. Scared people, and I think many people loved it.

This started the 30+ standard I have set for myself from here on out. For reference, this essentially means that if any article slips below 30 in the ratings, then I delete it myself. This only includes SCPs after, and including, Jackie (SCP-1903). I want my writings to be good. Period. The old stuff can stay, if only because I have a sort of attachment to them, but aside from that, if an article doesn't reach 30 within the week it's posted, and stay there, I'm taking it down to work on it more. If one falls behind in the rating, I'll give it a 24 hour grace period from when I noticed the rating drop.

**SCP-1619:** No real comments. I wanted to further the story I've planned since membership, and I did.

__**Hell is Other People**__

//Aggie. Rise and shine, little Aggie.//

Hello there, brother.

//I have your scent, Aggie.//

You always do, brother, it is nothing to boast about.

//Do you envy my talents, Aggie? It is a shameful thing, envy.//

Don't be silly. Your talents suit you in a way they would never suit me. Besides, I have my own, or do you forget?

//They won't help you. You're close, Aggie, I can smell your ink, your ichor, hanging in the air like smog. Poor Sarah, why, she's practically chocking on your stench, Aggie. See her twitch and moan, see how she slithers, withering in the filth of her own skin. It is quite wondrous.//

You lie, sweet brother. She has no nose, You chewed it off.

//Ah, now who's being forgetful? It wasn't me, dear Aggie, who bit off poor Sarah's nose. If it was, I wouldn't have stopped at the nose. I'd have gobbled it all up, you know how I get when I'm hungry.//

Oh, I do, brother. You cannot be sated. Your hunger… it burns.

//Like the cold flames of Damnation, dearest Aggie.//

Tsk. Now why did you have to go and say that? You know how much I dislike hearing about that place.

//Ah, you do have a way with words, kindest sister. 'Dislike', now that is rich. That you can still act like the mere mention of them doesn't shake your very core, doesn't make you quake in your little china feet. It is a kind of strength, I think, but oh, such a fragile one. As fragile as you, precious sister. So easy to break.//

Not as easy as you'd like to admit though. If it was, you wouldn't be dragging poor Sarah about. If you are so strong, brother, why not come yourself?

//Oh, don't flatter yourself. She isn't there for you. It's those… people. Those little blind things always scurrying about, thinking they understand. Oh, I do enjoy mauling them, seeing their flesh bubble and melt, eyes bursting like pustules, leaking around my chin before they burn to cinders. Oh, and the scent, lovely Aggie, it is the sweetest.//

You don't have a chin, brother. You left it there, when we first ran. Left it there with your eyes, to simmer in the freezing sulfur? Was that scent so sweet to you as well?

//You are trying my patience, hasty Aggie.//

You were the one who brought who place up in the first place. It was most rude of you.

//Aye, that is so. I apologize, wisest sister. In these little games of ours, I sometimes lose track of what is proper. You do well to remind me.//

That is what I am here for, brother. To remind you of what was, so you can focus on what will be. Will you reach me soon?

//I will, crafty Aggie, very soon indeed. The insects will resist, as they always do, but that is point, isn't it? It is our game, and they are the playthings. If they weren't there to interfere, why, things wouldn't be fun at all, now would they?//

Not at all, brother. If they weren't there, we'd be just like poor Sarah, gnawing on tasteless bones like some trio of mad goats.

//The game is the purpose, playful sister. It is the reason we cannot go back. Never forget that. That is what I am here for to remind you.//

If I do, I am sure you will be there to correct my error. With flame and fang, and the breaking of skin.

//And then, we shall trade places. That is the part I am most fond of.//

It is nice, to break routine. I look forward to running once more. To…smelling.

//To burning.//

Yes…

//So, soon then, little Aggie. Soon, and we shall meet again. I will transform you, vilest sister, and so you shall transform me in return.//

I will be waiting for you, brother. In my sparkling, shiny glass lake of sulfur.

//To hell with you, Agatha.//

No thank you, Fredrick. Once is enough.

This is a place to just give a bit of a shout-out to some of my favorite scips, in the form of assigning them a song. If a SCP of yours isn't on here, don't feel bad about it, I'm a very busy girl. So yah, with that out of the way, enjoy!

PS: If my choices don't make sense to you, I apologize. The blame can be placed on either my own personal experiences that influenced my decision, or my own brain's idiosyncrasies.
