**“Alias” Personnel File**

**Security Clearance Level:** 3

**Occupation:** Field Agent

**Description:**  “Alias” claims to have no given name and was initially reluctant to take an alias, claiming that “names are dangerous.”  Alias wears an all black suit with gloves, a black fedora and a face-mask at all times, leaving no skin uncovered.  He has variously claimed that this is because of a skin condition, allergies, and extreme sensitivity to light.  Alias tests ██ standard deviations above normal in agility and is significantly stronger than expected considering his size.  He has survived encounters with several highly dangerous SCPs under unlikely circumstances, most notably [[[SCP-953]]].

**History:**  Alias joined the Foundation after becoming involved in the original retrieval of [[[SCP-247]]], in which the retrieval team credit him with preventing unacceptable casualties by incapacitating 247 from outside its effective range before the team was massacred.  Prior to [DATA EXPUNGED BY REQUEST].

//Note:  Researchers, please stop coming forward with your suspicions that Alias may not actually be human.  Considering his loyalty to the Foundation and his mental stability compare to the rest of our staff, we don’t really care what he is.//

Alias has been instrumental in the retrieval and/or classification of the following SCPs:
[[[SCP-247]]]
[[[SCP-370]]]
[[[SCP-585]]]
