**Name:** ██████ "Noaqiyeum" "Noa" "Dataphile" ███████

**Title:** Scientific Consultant and Solutions Advisor, "Glorified Scrivener"

**Clearance Level:** Circumstance-dependent; direct access to SCPs is atypical

**Duties:** Directs and oversees testing of poorly-understood SCPs in order to determine patterns of regular behavior, including comparison-testing to identify similarities and cross-reactions; designing appropriate containment structures to prevent undesired results while permitting maximum access, and establishing plans for individual and mass containment breach; general systematization of known data

**History:**
Mr. Noaqiyeum was acquired from the Foundation via a mandatory recruitment from ███████ during an investigation of the object 88-0009-ATY "Oul's Egg", ██/██/████. Due to his familiarity through service to a diverse range of organizations interested in SCP-related objects, including ███████, the █████ ██████████, and the ██████████ ██ █████████ ██████, the Foundation has retained him as an organizational and coordinating advisor.

Due to a propensity for underestimating the potential danger of various experiments, Noaqiyeum has been given multiple psychological evaluations to verify his continued usefulness in ███████ CORRUPTED DATA ERROR
