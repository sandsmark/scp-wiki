title:Personnel File - Noaqiyeum
**Name:** ██████ "Noaqiyeum" "Noa" "Dataphile" ███████

**Title:** Scientific Consultant and Solutions Advisor, "Glorified Scrivener"

**Clearance Level:** Circumstance-dependent; direct access to SCPs is atypical

**Duties:** Directs and oversees testing of poorly-understood SCPs in order to determine patterns of regular behavior, including comparison-testing to identify similarities and cross-reactions; designing appropriate containment structures to prevent undesired results while permitting maximum access, and establishing plans for individual and mass containment breach; general systematization of known data

**History:**
Mr. Noaqiyeum was acquired from the Foundation via a mandatory recruitment from ███████ during an investigation of the object 88-0009-ATY "Oul's Egg", ██/██/████. Due to his familiarity through service to a diverse range of organizations interested in SCP-related objects, including ███████, the █████ ██████████, and the ██████████ ██ █████████ ██████, the Foundation has retained him as an organizational and coordinating advisor.

Noaqiyeum has exhibited a inconsistent tendency to ignore certain potential dangers of jobs he is given, both SCP-related and not. His recommended containment procedures occasionally contain blatant errors despite being otherwise complete (claiming that they are "easy to stop if they ever happen" or "too unlikely to note" when they are pointed out), and his advice for experimental tests often results in more collateral damage than the results are worth. This tendency persists even (or especially) when Noaqiyeum is himself put at risk as a result of his actions, which, due to his low reaction time and physical capacity, is likely to happen whenever he enters a situation in person. Psychological evaluations suggest this is not the result of any exceptional mental aberration (though he has been known to demonstrate unusual results when infected with memetic contagions on two occasions), however, and he has been assigned to an office where such effects are less likely to occur.
On ██/██/████, ██████ ███ ███████ ██ [[[scp-028 |███-███]]], █████ ████████ ██ █████ ████ ████████████ █████████ ██ [[[scp-055 |███-███]]]. Noaqiyeum █████████ ████ ███████████ ██ ██ of utmost importance, but █████ ██ █████████ ██ ███████████ █████ ████████ to ███ ██s. According to ███ ██s, however, ██ ██████ ██ ███ ████ ██████ ██████.
As a direct result of this incident, Noaqiyeum is no longer permitted to directly contact any SCPs of Euclid-class or higher, barring special approval or other extreme circumstances.
