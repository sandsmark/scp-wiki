An instance of SCP-4965-1 discovered by Dymphna in Cancún, Mexico.
[[/div]]
[[/div]]

----

**Special Containment Procedures:** Outbreaks of SCP-4965 are detected using a pattern recognition AI, 'Dymphna', which has been distributed to most major world governments using Director Blackwood's connections in the //Parlement de la Sécurité Internationale// [[footnote]]The Parliament of International Security.[[/footnote]]. The Foundation has also updated the words and phrases it monitors in global news channels to include descriptions of SCP-4965's effects.

Upon discovery of an outbreak, the Foundation is to liaise with local governments to initiate protocol Whiskey-Hotel-Oscar, rendering the effected town quarantined under the premise of an anthrax outbreak. All residents are screened for SCP-4965's influence. Infected humans are designated as SCP-4965-1. All surrounding localities and transit sites are to be monitored for 72 hours post containment to minimise the risk of a breach.

With a single exception [[footnote]]See Event-4965-C2.[[/footnote]] there have been no observed cases of SCP-4965 spreading outside of instanced outbreaks, during which between 10 and 50 people within a 2km radius are infected simultaneously. However, in light of this exception, Foundation personnel are no longer permitted direct contact with SCP-4965-1 without direct orders from Director Blackwood. Any D-class personnel making contact should typically wear Type-B HazMat suits, D-class who make direct contact without the use of a HazMat suit are to be contained or terminated post-testing.

Containment sites should provide relative comfort. Suggested dimensions for containment cells are 8m x 8m x 3m and all cells must be constructed and maintained adhering to level-2 biohazard containment protocols. Cells will typically contain various entertainment media negotiable based on the occupant’s requests. SCP-4965-1s who were previously involved romantically will typically be permitted to cohabit unless currently involved in research. All details are adjustable at the discretion of Foundation facilities management staff.

**Description:** SCP-4965 is a sentient, parasitic entity which typically infects a cluster of between 10 and 50 people in bursts, usually contained to a single city or town. Use of antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals, amnestics and all other attempted medical approaches have proven ineffective in removing SCP-4965's control over instances of SCP-4965-1.

The primary anomalous property of SCP-4965 is its ability to control human hosts provided they are not being visually observed by another being with a score higher than 0.2 on the Foundation’s Extended Intelligence Test (EIT) [[footnote]]The approximate intelligence of a large canine or a typically developing human around 18 months old.[[/footnote]]. Observation through any non-direct means such as video cameras has no effect on SCP-4965.

The control SCP-4965 exerts over a host varies with time since infection. Initially, unobserved SCP-4965-1 instances simply remain static when unobserved. The dexterity of the instance of SCP-4965-1's movement then increases at a roughly linear rate over the course of approximately one month at which time the SCP-4965-1's movements will be indistinguishable from their typical movements, in some cases even displaying improved facility of movement.

SCP-4965 possesses a clear personality, though it has been observed to be extremely inconsistent over time. Since containment, the entity has demonstrated benevolence, cordiality, levity and often a seemed sense of gratification in the mockery of Foundation staff. It is theorised that the entity's personality is partially affected by the personalities of the SCP-4965-1s under its control.

**Addendum:**
Research into SCP-4965 has been approved by Director Blackwood and executed by Dr. Grierson et al at site T-4965-14. Results of Dr. Grierson's research, as well as relevant observations and supplementary documents, are logged in file SCP-4965-E, accessible to those with Level 2/4965 authorisation.

++++ Foreword from Dr. Grierson:
Thanks to Director Blackwood, we can finally study this thing in such a way as to ascertain more than just 'people stay still when not being looked at', or 'people make stuff up'.

This research is going to mean something. We aim to discover SCP-4965's origins, how it works, how to truly contain it. Others who have studied SCP-4965 have become unnerved by its 'personality'. We shall not share their weak-mindedness.

Just as Director Blackwood has told us from the start: //Nil satis nisi optimum//. Let's be good enough.

**Procedure:** Subject's condition has been observed to include minor movement prior to the experiment. IT is to be left unobserved in a standing position and observed via video feed for movement. The test will be terminated subject to Dr. Grierson discretion as to whether collected data is sufficient.

**Results:** IT was left standing in the middle of the room. After 12 seconds of stillness, he began to move approximately 4 feet to the nearest seat. This movement, including sitting down, took 53 seconds.
 
For the next 28 minutes and 5 seconds, no changes occurred. Dr. Grierson temporarily ceased the test for a coffee break. After returning sometime later, Dr. Grierson called for Doctors Shields and Nguyen to return immediately.
 
IT was sitting in the same chair which had been moved to the centre of the room facing the camera which IT stared at, unblinking for at least 1 minute and 47 seconds. The lens of the camera had been scratched from inside the cell in backwards letters so the camera feed reads the words 'Always Watching. Never Seeing.'.

++++ |**Note from Dr. Grierson:**
I don’t know how it could have happened. IT scratching a camera lens a few feet off the ground is impressive but fairly plausible. Somehow deleting the recording for the whole session? It doesn't align with any previously observed properties of SCP-4965. There is so much we still don't understand about SCP-4965's capabilities.

Further research into these capabilities will be added to the research schedule.

**Procedure:** Subjects observed simultaneously from any anomalous behaviour pertaining to synchronicity. The test will be terminated subject to Dr. Grierson discretion as to whether collected data is sufficient.
 
**Results:** For 4 minutes and 8 seconds of being observed no notable activity occurs. At this point, IT begins to hum the supposed melody of 'In the Air Tonight' by Phil Collins. Approximately 12 seconds later IT is joined by WA, TC and HES who all 'air drum' the signature drum fill of the song at the appropriate time to match IT's humming. They then continue hum in sync whilst going about mundane business: IT writes a letter, WA reads a book, TC plays a video game and HES watches television.
 
12 minutes and 12 seconds after the test began, all individuals move to the centre of their rooms and face their respective camera. They all stop humming at the same time and adopt the poses of 'The Beatles' on the cover of the album 'Help!' in such an order that the 4 monitors display the poses in the correct order.

Dr. Grierson becomes visibly annoyed. He instructs the junior researchers to observe as he visits IT to see how the others react.
 
46 seconds later, IT's camera cuts out for 8.5 seconds. When the video feed returns, IT is no longer in containment and the door to the cell is visibly open. Dr. Shields immediately activates containment breach protocol.
 
During this time, WA, TC and HES all take a seat, cross-legged and feign sleeping but bearing a smile.
 
Another 4 minutes and 23 seconds pass and on-site security escort a disoriented IT back into his containment cell.

++++ Correspondance from Dr. Grierson to Director Blackwood:
Shields is right.

I was alone in the monitoring room just before the records were wiped... I was alone during IT's containment breach. SCP-4965 appears to be toying with me. The entity has been very clear that it has help from the outside, and it claimed I had had some profound effect on it...

You taught us to strive for greatness... "//Nil satis nisi optimum//". Perhaps I should regard some different Latin wisdom today.

"//Entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem//."

Ockham's razor. I will submit myself for screening under the supervision of Dr. Shields. She remained vigilant when I had failed; she shall remain objective if it comes to...

If this is the last thing I write as a man who believes himself to contain his own sensibilities... Please, tell Charlie and Maisie that I love them... and that I'm sorry.

**Current date:** 07/05/20██. 
**Date of event:** 05/05/20██. 
**Time of event:** 05:55:55

SCP-4965-1s in five different containment sites simultaneously spoke the word: 'Goodbye'. Following this, every instance of SCP-4965-1 being observed began to scream in pain, holding their heads.

Following this, no SCP-4965 symptoms have been observed.

++++ Correspondance from Dr. Shields to Director Blackwood:
Today's date is 25/05/20██. 20 days since Event-4965-C and there are no signs of SCP-4965's return. Grierson has been contained for 3 weeks and hasn't shown a single symptom of SCP-4965's influence. He has, however, began to present isolation-induced schizophrenia-like symptoms (including lethargy, withdrawal, delusions and hallucinations).

Grierson has spoken aloud to us several times in the past few days; indicating that he believes himself the subject of an SCP-4965 led coup. He has repeatedly scolded Nguyen and me for purportedly succumbing to SCP-4965. 

He has also appeared to hold one-sided conversations with an imagined second party, presumably, his psychosis induced manifestation of SCP-4965; showing extreme resentment and at times tendencies towards self-harm.

Requesting permission to order his immediate release.

I'm also issuing a strong recommendation that he be declared unfit to return to employment pending psychiatric review.

**Current Date:** 26/05/20██
**Date of Event:** 26/05/20██
**Time of Event:** 19:37 (approx)

Following Dr. Grierson's incarceration, our testing providing no results caused him to grow enraged and send us (myself and Dr. Nguyen) away. Thankfully, prior to his release Dr. Nguyen made the suggestion of switching Grierson's Foundation standard recorder with an older, magnetic strip recorder. This suggestion has proven instrumental in proving Dr. Grierson's involvement with SCP-4965's site-wide containment breach now designated as Event-4965-C2, as he destroyed his recorder before the attempted escape.

Based on the recovered audio, Grierson displayed extremely erratic behaviour before intentionally initiating the site-wide breach responsible for the escape of 4 instances of SCP-4965-1, during which the SCP-4965-1 population at large began presenting symptoms again. It is believed that Event-4965-C was engineered by SCP-4965 to manipulate Foundation staff. Containment procedures have been updated. Breach response teams are currently searching for the emancipated SCP-4965-1s.

Due to the lack of a physical manifestation of SCP-4965, we are unable to determine the nature of Grierson's betrayal. His mental condition was demonstrably unstable throughout containment and could have informed such behaviour. Though his perceived condition may have been another of SCP-4965's manipulations, using Grierson as a puppet to facilitate its escape.

Myself (Dr. Shields) and Dr. Nguyen attempted to leave T-4965-14 following the containment breach alarm as per protocol; however, we encountered a disoriented and erratic Grierson standing motionless at the exit of the facility.

Grierson looked up at us for a brief moment before turning a stolen security sidearm on himself.

He was declared dead on-site by medical personnel.

If I may tarnish the official record with an ounce of sentiment for a once dear friend... let it be known that I hope Dr. Grierson rests peacefully.
