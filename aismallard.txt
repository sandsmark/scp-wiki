[[tab Author Commentary]]
Some thoughts on the articles I've written. Spoilers galore.
[[/tab]]
[[tab SCP-4339]]
My first scip, and an introduction for me into how much effort goes into a good mainlist article. I don't remember //exactly// how I got the idea, but it probably came out of this recent philosophy of the power semantics and (non-anomalous) memetics has over the world.

As mentioned in the forums, I was inspired by the blog post [*http://ansuz.sooke.bc.ca/entry/23 "What colour are your bits?"] and [*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzj7Wg4DAbs Why humans run the world | Yuval Noah Harari], both about how humans have created a powerful world of the symbolic and nonphysical. I wanted to really show how much we rely on these invisible structures of power and organization, and explore 

It has really improved since its first draft, but there are still some elements I dislike. The "found by a mentally ill man" was about the only reasonable origin story I could come up with, since they had to figure out the object had interesting properties, but also not have the originator use it to take over the world. However the overall effect feels a bit like a cop out.

Likewise the two incidents of researchers attempting to change things against policy are reflective of an earlier idea I had focusing more on the fact that power corrupts. The original ending was going to be a short addendum saying that the object had no compulsive or addictive effect. I've been tempted to remove the amendment incident, but I think it's necessary as a dramatic moment, both to show how damn powerful 4339 is, but also to set the scene for Archibald's "cleanup".

[[tab SCP-3597]]
My second article and first contest entry! ([[[cliche-con-2019|Cliché-Con 2019]]]) I wrote the bulk of the initial draft on my flight for winter break. The idea came when I was looking through the list of clichés and saw "Mobile Task Force gets steamrolled", and tried to think a good in-universe justification for the Foundation's best agents to get completely wiped. The answer seemed simple: the anomaly itself made it so. I decided on making the recovery the emphasis of the story. D = Disposable-class was sort of a natural add-on, after all, if we're going to kill some MTFs, why not them too?

The [DATA EXPUNGED] description was, admittedly, a bit of a gimmick, and I know it turned off at least some readers. However I was struggling to think of a good way of describing the effect without totally spoiling it and rendering the recovery logs as useless fluff. Ultimately I decided no description was better than a crappy one.
