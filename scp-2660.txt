**Item #:** SCP-2660

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2660 is currently held in a standard containment chamber, with an additional set of doors to prevent line-of-sight access to connecting corridors. 

Personnel may not take any physical or digital notes while testing SCP-2660, and must instead verbally report all test results to the designated test director (currently Dr. Gently).

All information about SCP-2660 is currently restricted to personnel with Level 3 clearance, or personnel approved to work with SCP-2660. **(Updated: See Addendum 2660-1)**

**Description:** SCP-2660 is a green ceramic table lamp which exhibits a self-clarifying infohazard. Awareness of one of SCP-2660's physical properties causes the observer to slowly gain awareness of all its physical properties; this process takes between three hours and two days to complete.

For example, persons viewing only a small portion of SCP-2660's surface can identify the object as a lamp. Images that have been extensively edited or color shifted are also prone to this effect, e.g., a color shifted photo still allows the subject to identify SCP-2660 as green. All information created involving SCP-2660 is persistent; it cannot be expunged, redacted, or lied about in any way.

Electronic text records regarding SCP-2660 cannot be erased or edited as to expunge data, and will instantly revert to unedited form if this is attempted. Messages written on paper regarding SCP-2660 will, if erased, gradually reappear on the paper over the course of 3-6 hours. Memories regarding SCP-2660 will never be forgotten, and cannot be erased by amnestic treatment.

Persons with a line of sight to SCP-2660[[footnote]]"Line of sight to SCP-2660" is defined as the ability to draw an unobstructed line between any point on the person or object in question to any point on SCP-2660's surface.[[/footnote]] experience the sensation of hearing a repeating beat, described as sequence of one long note followed by two short notes, accompanied by a constant buzzing. Objects or persons with a line of sight to SCP-2660 are affected by an additional anomalous effect, designated SCP-2660-1. SCP-2660-1 only affects objects with line of sight contact to SCP-2660, and only for the duration of that contact.

SCP-2660-1's effect varies from each object tested, although similar objects usually exhibit the same effect. All SCP-2660-1 affected items are subject to SCP-2660's self-clarifying effect.

In testing it was found that a human affected by SCP-2660-1, when asked to identify an item experiencing SCP-2660-1, consistently give identical answers.[[footnote]]Humans who speak different languages will give consistent responses within their own language, synonymous with other-language responses.[[/footnote]] These answers as reported by D-10748 are found in the "identification" column.

||~ Item(s) tested ||~ Identification ||~ Notes||
|| D-10748 || "A person." || D-10748, previously uncooperative and aggressive, shows a considerable change in character, becoming compliant and calm nearly instantaneously.||
|| Male Labrador Retriever || "A dog." || Animal responded to simple commands (including "sit", "stay", and "come") despite a lack of previous training.||
|| Philips-head screwdriver and Allen screw || "A screwdriver and a screw." || The screw was able to be manipulated by the screwdriver, despite not matching.||
|| Padlock and non-matching key || "A lock and key." || The key was able to successfully open the lock, despite not matching mechanically.||
|| "Swiss Army" multitool || "A tool." || The multitool is able to be operated as a knife to cut a length of rope, despite lacking a knife attachment. Camera footage shows D-10748 moving the tool in a cutting motion, and the rope behaving as if cut by an invisible knife.||
|| Copy of Emily Bronte's "Wuthering Heights"|| "A book." || D-10748 is able to complete the novel in 42 minutes. D-10748 scores perfectly on a short test of plot knowledge, but is unable to describe the novel in a metaphorical way.||
|| Copy, in Russian, of Fyodor Dostoevsky's "Crime and Punishment" || "A book." || D-10748 completes the novel in 45 minutes. Test results are as above.||
|| Print of Leonardo da Vinci's "Mona Lisa" || "An image." || D-10748 is able to describe the woman depicted in the painting in detail, but is unable to comment on the colors or techniques used.||
||Battery-powered flashlight || "A flashlight." || D-10748 shone the flashlight on himself and noted an unpleasant buzzing noise.||
||"Kant Counter" reality measurement device|| "An instrument." || Counter fluctuated between 57 and 104 Humes in the vicinity of SCP-2660.[[footnote]]Humes measure the strength of reality in a given area, with 1 Hume being average in unaltered space.[[/footnote]]||
||Scranton-Eamon Reality Sink[[footnote]]The SERS is an experimental tool meant to lower the Hume count of space in a sphere with a ten meter radius, centered on the SERS. In layman's terms, the SERS functions by siphoning reality from its surroundings and centralizing it inside the device. The effects reverse upon deactivation.[[/footnote]] || "A drain." || No changes in local reality detected. ||

SCP-2660 was recovered following a Foundation raid on a known headquarters of the Maxwellist sect of the Church of the Broken God[[footnote]]While many orders of the Church of the Broken God believe in a deity with a fractured physical body, the Maxwellist sect worships a deity composed of information and believes that this deity manifests through human connectivity. As such, the internet and other global communication networks are of particular interest to Maxwellist worshippers.[[/footnote]]. While the raid was otherwise successful, it was suspected by memetic analysts that MTF Nu-7 "Hammer Down" may have been exposed to cognitohazardous material during the operation. Cautionary amnestic treatments were utilized, but subsequent treatment evaluations revealed that some memories remained, all dealing with a lamp briefly spotted in the center of a "worship" hall. The object was secured and designated SCP-2660.

[[collapsible show="Show Interview Log 7154" hide="Hide Interview Log 7154"]]
The following interview log has been attached to this document due to relevance to the continued containment of SCP-2660. 
> **Interviewed:** POI-7154, former head of the raided Maxwellist site.
> 
> **Interviewer:** Dr. Sandu
> 
> **Foreword:** Interview was conducted in a specially constructed Faraday cage used to interview objects or persons that emit moderate to severe amounts of electromagnetic radiation. Due to the nature of modifications on POI-7154's person to allow for connectivity and collaboration with fellow cultists, use of this chamber was authorized. The interview was conducted 14 days after initial object recovery.
> 
> **<Begin Log>**
> 
> **Dr. Sandu:** Sarah Richards, henceforth referred to as POI-7154. You were found at the Maxwellist camp in [REDACTED]. Our intel indicates that you were the head of this particular branch. Is this true?
> 
> **POI-7154:** Yes.
> 
> **Dr. Sandu:** How many others were working under you?
> 
> **POI-7154:** They're here.
> 
> **Dr. Sandu:** I've been informed that you've got some hardware in your head that lets you talk to your friends. That doesn't work here, miss.
> 
> **POI-7154:** There is no need to use hardware, anymore. My people, we have... transcended. I can feel them. They're nearby.
> 
> [Note: At this point, four additional cultists were being interviewed within the same wing of the site as this interview.]
> 
> **Dr. Sandu:** How do you "feel them" without hardware to send and receive messages? According to our x-rays, which lit up like a Christmas tree, by the way, you have several transmitting devices implanted into your cranium. Devices which are currently non-functional.
> 
> **POI-7154:** There is no need for hardware. We are connected through the unreality. 
> 
> **Dr. Sandu:** How are you connected? What is "unreality"?
> 
> **POI-7154:** You are in unreality right now. The lies, the expunged, the hidden? The unreality is pervasive, and you perpetuate it. SCP-2660.
> 
> **Dr. Sandu:** That designation is classified.
> 
> **POI-7154:** Don't you see? Classification, redaction, it's all useless. The omnipresent is the truth. It has come from the true place, and it is pure, unbridled information, a connection between all who have beheld it. The Signal. 
> 
> **Dr. Sandu:** Your Signal... your god.
> 
> **POI-7154:** Doctor Gabriel Sandu. Your people, you have it now. So long as you have it, it will become a part of you. It will unite you, as it has united my people.
> 
> **Dr. Sandu:** And what happens when we are "united"?
> 
> **POI-7154:** Then we pierce the veil. All of us. Together.
> 
> [POI-7154 begins tapping the table in a pattern similar to the vibrations originating from SCP-2660. Dr. Sandu is quietly informed of the risk of cognitohazardous influence.]
> 
> **Dr. Sandu:** This interview is... concluded.
> 
> [POI-7154 does not speak, instead increasing the intensity of the pounding as the interview is concluded.]
> 
> **<End Log>**

**Addendum 2660-1:** Following the events of Interview 7154, all persons who had previously been directly exposed to SCP-2660 were detained and placed in quarantine pending further review of SCP-2660's containment procedures. Dr. Sandu was detained following an attempt to break protocol and communicate with affected persons. As the limits of what constitutes "knowledge" of SCP-2660 are not fully understood, all information on the current status of quarantined persons is hereby restricted to personnel with express clearance from Level 4 personnel of the Foundation memetics department.
