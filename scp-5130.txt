**Special Containment Procedures:** A 20km exclusion radius is to be enforced around SCP-5130 via the Foundation submarine SCPF //Bohr//. Outpost-5130 has been established directly adjacent to SCP-5130 for this purpose, and is to coordinate SCPF //Bohr// operations as well as house relevant personnel. Beyond the current SCP-5130-2 instance if extant, access to SCP-5130 and SCP-5130-1 specimens by any individual is prohibited. 

**Description:**  SCP-5130 is an island located in the Indian Ocean[[footnote]]Exact coordinates withheld.[[/footnote]], measuring 70 km in depth with a 210 km^^2^^ land area. SCP-5130 displays several anomalous attributes, including:
* the constant generation of a localized weather system maintaining itself at a temperature of 300 K regardless of surrounding climate,
* the ocean adjacent to SCP-5130 consisting of potable (fresh) water instead of saline water,
* a lack of endemic fauna despite the presence of ideal conditions for sustained habitation, and
* an extensive endemic population of anomalous plant life, collectively designated SCP-5130-1.

SCP-5130-1 consists of several discrete species of anomalous flora resembling a variety of foodstuffs; testing has confirmed a similar chemical composition and nutritional content to associated foods. Additionally, SCP-5130-1 instances display accelerated regenerative capabilities, with any removed matter regrowing within a maximum of one hour. SCP-5130-1 instances will rapidly degrade and calcify, becoming non-consumable, on removal from SCP-5130.

The following table displays several selected examples of SCP-5130-1 instances.

||~ Designation ||~ Description ||
|| 5130-1-017 || Flowering bush sprouting fruiting pods similar to processed sausages. || 
|| 5130-1-023 || Leafy vine which, when cut, exudes fluid similar to maple syrup. ||
|| 5130-1-031 || Leafy plant with tuberous roots similar to potatoes which appear to grow cooked and seasoned. ||
|| 5130-1-044 || Flowering tree; flower petals bear strong similarities to toasted slices of bread. ||
|| 5130-1-062 || Stalked plant growing buds similar in appearance and composition to roasted chicken legs. ||

If a human observes sustained consumption of SCP-5130-1 over a period of time greater than one hour, they will become subject to several anomalous effects and are thereafter considered an instance of SCP-5130-2. SCP-5130-2 instances experience a mild addiction to SCP-5130-1, which is unaccounted for by chemical composition. Additionally, instances display a strong aversion to exiting SCP-5130, although this is not believed to arise from an anomalous compulsive effect. 

Testing has determined that it is impossible for more than one human to reach SCP-5130 at any one time. This is primarily due to the sudden manifestation of dangerous meteorological phenomena, such as extreme winds and electrical storm systems, in the surrounding area when multiple individuals approach SCP-5130. The intensity of these phenomena scales at a geometric rate approaching SCP-5130, with the anomaly as the epicenter; this has invariably resulted in the expiration of all approaching subjects but one.

In addition to the difficulties in directly approaching SCP-5130, its remote location renders long-range communication unreliable. As a result, over time, SCP-5130-2 instances appear to experience significant psychological damage as a result of isolation, and become increasingly dependent on the consumption of SCP-5130-1 as a coping mechanism. SCP-5130-1 specimens will undergo extensive chemical and physical alterations in response to this, which remain poorly documented.

After a variable period with a recorded maximum of five months, a dense storm system which severely limits visibility will form surrounding SCP-5130, persisting for twenty-four hours. Following the disappearance of the storm, the SCP-5130-2 instance will no longer be present. The status of SCP-5130-2 instances during and after this event is uncertain.

A significant portion of data relating to SCP-5130 originates from Relevant Material (RM)-5130, a ship’s journal sealed in a rudimentary cask composed of calcified wood[[footnote]]Later identified as originating from a SCP-5130-1 instance.[[/footnote]], which was recovered on the coastline of Mumbai. RM-5130 was partially water-damaged and stained by various vegetable oils, but relevant portions could be recovered in a readable state. 

The author of RM-5130 was determined to be one Emil Waltherson, a British sailor who was thought to have died at sea in 1829. Based on information from relevant portions of RM-5130, Waltherson is currently believed to have been stranded on SCP-5130 after his vessel, the //Celeste//, ran aground and was destroyed. Subsequently, Waltherson became a SCP-5130-2 instance.

Pertinent sections of RM-5130 are appended below, and have been transcribed for readability.
