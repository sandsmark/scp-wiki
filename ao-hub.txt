> Hello, my name's Westrin[[footnote]]The original poster of the challenge. This hub has been created in his stead.[[/footnote]], and I'm here to give you a hopefully fun challenge! Been bouncing this idea around for a while, and the general consensus is that it should be a challenge thread, so it shall!
> 
> Pick an item from the log-of-anomalous-items, and make an interesting tale about it.
> 
> Here are the rules:
> 
> * As it says on the tin, pick a single item from the log and make a tale about it.[[footnote]]Writing your own AO specifically for this challenge doesn't count, as it kind of defeats the point. Otherwise, everything's fair game.[[/footnote]] There are no word limits, so go nuts.
> * --Copy and paste the anomalous object you wish to write about at the top of the page, and then follow up with the tale.-- This isn't required any more. You can put the AO entry wherever.
> * The tale //cannot// feature any SCPs heavily. It can get minor mentions, but cannot put one onto the spotlight. This is to prevent the "Anomalous object getting empowered by an SCP" route from being taken.
> * The anomalous object must show a deeper and important meaning or have deep implications to its setting (Foundation-verse), and not just be a simple anomaly. You have to make it feel like a significant anomaly, despite it just being an anomalous object. Whether it's the unbreakable lamp being Zeus' bedside lamp, or the ranch dressing banana slugs being an endangered species that introduced ranch dressing to the native Americans in the first thanksgiving. It's also encouraged that the deeper meaning makes sense to the object's nature, and is not completely random.
> * Please pick an item that most likely isn't going to get pruned. Any new entries are discouraged, but you still can pick them if you want to take the risk.
> * //HARD MODE:// Make the tale for one of the canons in the canon hub. Does not matter which one.
> * Have fun. If you disobey this rule, you will be executed. :)
> Good luck!

Feel free to format and style your entries however you want, and I'm opening the challenge up to entries from the logs of Extranormal Events and Unexplained Locations -- the more tales the better!
