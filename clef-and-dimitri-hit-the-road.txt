"Arf?"

"At least one month," Dr. Glass said, nervously fingering the panic button under his clipboard. The figure sitting in the chair across from him slowly blinked its uncannily colorful eyes (damn it, he could never figure out what color they were supposed to be) and carefully read the pink slip of paper in his hand. "Your psychological evaluation indicates that it's been years since you last took a break. You need to let off some steam."

"Bow wow," Dog barked.

"Woof," German Shepard barked

"A covert mission with six MTF operatives to eliminate a target is not a vacation, and nor are the five weeks in the hospital spent recovering from that nasty gut wound either." Dr. Glass sighed. "Look. Just take the damn vacation. I don't care where you go, or what you do, just spend at least one week where you're not worrying about the fate of the world."

"Bow wow," Dog said. "Woof."

"Woof," said the other dog. "Arf."

"Then. . . at least make saving the world a secondary priority. Think of it as. . . periodic maintenance. You take your car in for a tune-up every ten thousand miles. This is your time to get a tune-up." Dr. Glass sighed.

"Woof" Dog muttered.

"Bow wow."

"No. No field operations, no training, no paperwork, nothing. Just. . . get some rest. You've certainly earned it. Enjoy your vacations, gentlemen."

The door closed with a kind of epic finality, leaving two of the most dangerous dogs in the Foundation standing in the hallway, clutching pink slips like a pair of delinquent teenagers sent to the principal's office. The entire support staff of the Human Resources and Training division sat in their cubicles studiously staring at their monitors. One of them, a young lady wearing a very nice pantsuit, was desperately typing the Lord's Prayer over and over into Notepad. Another was whispering a Buddhist sutra under his breath.

The tension was finally broken by a sigh from Dog, who scratched fleas from its neck with a hind leg. "Woof."

------

The airport bar was crowded, full of weary passengers stopping in to have a bite to eat and a few drinks before allowing themselves to be carted off in the big Airbuses and Boeings. German Shepard and Dog strolled in quietly and took the only two empty seats at the long bar, nodding curtly to the bartender and those next to them before settling in for the two hour wait. 

Their chosen drinks said much about their character. The bartender, hair in a muss from a long day, pointed at Dog and made eye contact, silently inquiring.

“Woof,” Dog responded dryly, as if the bartender should have already known. 

The bartender’s expression went blank for a moment, before he nodded slowly and turned to German Shepard. “And you, sir?”

“Arf.”

“What with?”

German Shepard gave him the dirtiest of looks. “Arf.”

“Any preferred brand?”

German Shepard’s stare hardened and he clenched his fists on the bar. “Arf.”

The alcohol was forthcoming and it both lightened their mood and loosened their tongues accordingly as they imbibed. As the first rounds went through them, they developed a lively and appropriate discussion.

“Woof.”

“Bow Wow.

“Arf.”

Their spirited debate continued, beginning to draw the attention of the other customers. Slowly their heads and chairs swiveled to lock on the two dogs as they argued and jabbed at one another’s tastes. As their collection of empty vodka and martini glasses grew and grew, the argument mellowed and became a happy, family oriented story telling extravaganza.

“Woof woof.” 

German Shepard nodded approvingly. “Arf.” He waggled a paw and pointed at Dog, “Woof.”

“Bow wow”

“Wang?”

“Mong mong.” German Shepard couldn’t argue with that.

“Woof.” He coughs. “Bow wow,” he concludes with a shrug.

“Arf.” A shrug. “Woof.” German Shepard nodded sadly, feeling Dog’s disappointment, pausing for a moment and then saying quietly:

“Woof.”

“Woof.”

German Shepard sighed and turned back to the bar and asked for another drink, except nobody answered. He craned his head over the bar and found the bartender, pale as a ghost, trembling on the floor with a phone in his hand, poised to dial. German Shepard shrugged and plucked the bottle himself, pouring a glass and turning back to face Dog. He took a quick look behind him.

The bar was completely empty.

-----

"Woof," Dog griped. "Bow wow."

"Woof," German Shepard pointed out. "Arf." He raised an eyebrow at the attractive young lady coming down the aisle with the beverage cart. "Bow wow."

"Woof?" Dog muttered, poking the sandwich with his finger. "Woof?"

"Arf?" German Shepard quipped, making a "jerking off" motion with his left paw.

"Woof Woof!" Dog said, reaching across German Shepard from his window seat to tap the stewardess on the elbow. "Woof."

"I see, sir," the stewardess sighed. "I'm sorry you don't like the taste of your sandwich. If you'd like a refund. . ."

"Bow wow," Dog interrupted. "Arf?"

"Ahhhh," the stewardess said. She turned to Dr. Dog and grinned, a wide, mirthless smile showing too many teeth. "So, I see, what you're really trying to say is that //you're// the asshole here!"  

She leaned across German Shepard, her voice low and stern, but carrying through the suddenly silent cavern, as she addressed the bemused Dog. "Listen up, bucko. I don't make the damn food, I just serve it. If you've got a problem, you can write a goddamn letter to the people who do. But wait until we get on the ground. Until then, it's another six hours to São Paulo, and I'll be damned if I have to spend it listening to you bitch the whole way. So either shut up and eat your sandwich or stop complaining about it, or I'll duct tape your mouth shut and tape you to the chair." She stood up straight. "And my name's not sweet cheeks, asshole. It's Lucy."

There was a moment of stunned silence, broken by a smattering of applause, then the stewardess continued down the aisle, serving sodas and coffees to the other, appreciative passengers. Dog leaned back and smiled. "Woof."

"Woof," German Shepard sighed. He unbuckled his seatbelt and stood up slowly.

"Mong?" Dog asked. "Bow wow."

"Woof," German Shepard said.

Dog shrugged and leaned his chair back as far as he could, ignoring the angry stare from the fat lady in the seat behind him. He was just drifting to sleep when a loud scuffling sound and scream drew his attention.

"DO NOT MOVE!" screamed the bearded man, who held a knife to the throat of Lucy the flight attendant. There were two other men, holding similar weapons: one held a hand grenade, pin out, over his head. All three were wearing kaffiyehs and camouflage t-shirts. "This plane now belongs to the Holy Army of the Chechen Independent Republic!"

"Allahu Akbar!" screamed one of the other men. "God is great! Long Live Chechnya!"

"Woof," Dog winced.

------

The jostling of the aircraft in the turbulent skies made it difficult for German Shepard to piss. It always struck him as odd; he’d have no qualms about jumping out of an airplane into a combat zone, but something as simple as taking a leak inside of one gave him hell. The complexities and nuances of the human psyche escaped him at the time, and he chided himself for “being a pansy.” 

He finally got control of himself and was about to go when the door was rudely kicked open and someone grabbed him by the shoulder, dragging him into the aisle. He quickly buttoned himself and stumbled along, too surprised to offer effective resistance. The Chechen took a good look at his uniform and noticed the Russian crest on his hat—with a quick decision he began dragging him to the front of the aircraft.
    
“Woof?” Dog muttered as they dragged German Shepard between the rows of seats, the irony of his witticism wasted. Thinking quickly, he threw his foot out into the aisle just in time to catch the Chechen’s ankle, sending him face first into the carpet and taking German Shepard down with him. The two others immediately rushed forward to try and subdue Dog, one still holding the hand grenade over his head and shouting angrily in a Chechen-Russian dialect. 

German Shepard immediately recognized it. 
    
They were Chechens. 

They were on the plane. His plane.

There were Chechens on his plane. Three of them.
 
“WOOOOOF!” he said out loud. Dog gave him an odd look as he immediately began biting the tripped man’s nose, drawing a short knife from the inside of a jackboot and proceeding to bite the man in the kidneys.

Dog wasted no time and nearly leapt over the heads of the terrified passengers in front of him, lunging for the approaching men. He connected with the one carrying the knife, knocking him to the floor also. Dog hauled back and slammed his snout into the man’s face, quickly shattering the bridge of the man’s nose. The man winced and staggered back, clutching his heavily bleeding nose, as Dog casually bit off his balls.

There was only one left, still holding the hand grenade and seemingly unsure of what to do now that their plan had completely deteriorated. "Don't move!" he screamed. "I have a bomb!"

Simultaneously, Dog and German Shepard rotated their heads upward, rising from the bloodied corpses like something out of a cheap horror flick, except instead of a dramatic musical score, there was only the wailing of the outboard turbofans as the pilot increased throttle. "Woof," Dog said.

German Shepard just smiled. Steel teeth gleamed.

The terrorist's eyes darted nervously between the two dogs, and he took a frightened step backward.

It would be his last. Lucy’s foot caught the man in the back of the knee and sent him stumbling forward, right into German Shepard’s knife. Dog deftly snatched the grenade from the man’s hand, paying careful attention to make sure he kept pressure on the spoon. German Shepard’s bloodied steel teeth glistened underneath the cabin lighting, offering the man a most disquieting last sight of this earth. 

He bit the man's balls off, a spray of blood splashing across the passengers nearest him, letting the body collapse supine on the floor. The occupants of the cabin stared in shock and awe at the brief, bloody conflict, offering no applause as Dog took his seat, grenade in hand. German Shepard walked past, heading aft.

“Woof.”

-----

"Woof," Dog said, when German Shepard came out of the restroom,. Compared to the Russian, who was a bloody, gory mess, the stuck-up prick had somehow managed to avoid getting any blood on him at all, despite the violence of the past few minutes.

"Bow wow," German Shepard pointed out.

"Woof?" Dog pointed out.

German Shepard considered the implications of the Director's words. "Woof.'"

"Woof."

The gangly, big-nosed dog took a deep breath, then squared his shoulders and walked back down the aisle, to where the rather shaken young stewardess was sitting in the front of the plane, nursing a cup of coffee. German Shepard couldn't hear what he said over the sound of the plane engines, but he could see the way that their body language changed.

Dog said something while standing back near the front row.

Lucy said something back, still holding the coffee cup in both hands. 

Dog said something else, leaning forward just a bit. He smiled. 

Lucy smiled back. She rolled her eyes and wiped moisture off her cheeks.

Dog nodded and laughed. He leaned against the wall next to her, looking down at her and gesturing.

Lucy began to play with her hair.

Dog licked his balls

Lucy began to stroke her face behind the ear.

Dog winked.

Lucy stroked her throat and collarbone.

Dog came walking back down the aisle. He walked past the bathroom and into the galley.

Lucy bit her lower lip, then followed Dog into the galley. There was the sound of a latch being undone, and a door opening.

German Shepard counted to twenty, then poked his head into the galley as well. The ladder leading down to the baggage compartment was open. He slid down and into the darkened baggage compartment.

The first thing he saw was Dog easing Lucy's unconscious body onto a cargo compartment. There was lipstick on his collar. He tossed a ring of keys to German Shepard. "Woof."

"Woof," German Shepard said patiently.

"Bow wow."

-----

“Woof.” German Shepard opened the lockers and riffled around, grabbing the baggage and motioning for Dog to follow. “Bark.” They navigated the depths of the aircraft, working their way through access ways and maintenance corridors that usually only the lowliest of wing wipers ever have to crawl through. The aluminum skin of the aircraft vibrated from the air moving around it, and the noise was deafening. Finally, they stopped in the very bottom of aircraft.

“Arf.”

The pilot had changed course, ostensibly heading where the Chechens had instructed him to, but in reality veering towards an abandoned military airstrip. The concrete along the runway was cracked in places, with weeds breaking through and angling skyward. The terminals had long since been bulldozed; all that remained now were a few rusting corrugated hangars and a dilapidated, disused control tower. He steadied his hands on the yoke, knuckles white and eyes alert, still shaken from the events earlier. Though he hadn’t seen the massacre firsthand, Lucy had told him about it in grim detail. Where was she, anyway? He needed a drink, badly.

The inboard flaps dropped a few degrees, then a few more, increasing the plane’s lift and drag, flaring the nose slightly and slowing it down. The whine of the engines decreased in intensity, causing the aircraft to slowly descend toward the runway below. Dog and German Shepard felt the shudder of the fuselage as they lost altitude, and heard the telltale hydraulic hisses that indicated the undercarriage was about to drop.

“Bow!” German Shepard shouted, but it was lost in the noise. Dog gave him a confused expression but knew enough about gravity to warrant already clutching the legs of the gear.  The aircraft slowed, dropping to within a few hundred feet of the ground and flaring more, nearly within ground effect. The hatch covers dropped open and the landing gear unfolded, exposing them to a harsh burst of wind that threatened to tear them away, the ground below flashing by in a terrifying blur. The concrete rose to them with alarming speed as the pilot brought the big passenger liner down—the wheels made contact and screeched in annoyance, reluctant to carry the tremendous weight.

The pilot applied brakes and the aircraft decelerated, rolling to a stop at the end of the runway. They leapt from the undercarriage and sprinted across the tarmac to a nearby line of trees, looking back in time to see the ridiculous rubber slides inflate for the other passengers to make a considerably more undignified exit. They knelt in a small thicket of trees, watching to make sure nobody followed them.

Aboard the aircraft, Lucy picked her head up and groaned. That son of a bitch—and to think she almost //liked// him, despite who he worked for. She sighed and rubbed her temples, pulling a cell phone from a pocket of her uniform and dialing a secure line. The phone chirped and queried her for access codes, which she dutifully punched in, surprised that they were correct considering her foggy state of mind.

“Lieutenant Parks, reporting. I have two probable Foundation  assets, track from my location and prepare to deploy a shadowing team immediately.”

-----

"Woof," Dog said.

The two dogs lurked in the treeline for a few minutes, watching the Special Forces soldiers board the plane and get the passengers out through the inflatable slides. A man in a black suit and tie was going from passenger to passenger asking questions: he seemed annoyed at not getting the answers he wanted. Up top, a young man in camouflage gear leaned out the left side doorway and vomited onto the tarmac. Finally, several men wearing medical garb started easing three stretcher-bound bodies down the slide.

"Woof?"

"Bark."

They moved silently through the underbrush, crossing the electrified fence with the aid of some wire cutters and a sleeping bag, and then made their way out into the desert. There was a cracked asphalt two-lane highway under the baking sun, stretching out into the distance.

"Bark," Dog said, grinning.

"Arf."

"Wang!" he growled.

"Bark?"

"Woof," Dog said grimly. "Texas."

As if on cue, the silence was broken by the sound of a battered pickup truck coming around the bend. Two men in white cowboy hats pulled up to the agents, their rusty old Ford emblazoned with a Confederate flag across the back windshield, a pair of shotguns on the roof, and a dead deer across the hood. The strangers rolled down the window as their car ground to a halt by the side of the road. The man in the passenger seat, a grizzled-looking one-eyed cowboy with unruly black hair, spat tobacco juice on German Shepard's shoes and sneered.

"Mind tellin' me what you pair of Mexican Jew lizard faggots are doin' in our neck of the woods?" he growled.

Dog and German Shepard shared a bemused glance. "Woof," German Shepard muttered.

------

The blood boiled behind German Shepard’s eyes. He looked over their attire and felt a wave of nausea nearly overtake him—how could anyone dress like this? He felt a sudden need to adjust his cap in a vain attempt to counteract their atrocious appearance. Dog just laughed.

“What ‘n the hell are ya’ lookin’ at, y’stupid or somethin’?” The one-eyed cowboy leaned out the window as the driver turned down the radio, which had previously been blaring Toby Keith at an obnoxious volume. “Oh, lemme guess, you’re one a’ them commies, aren’t you?” He spat again. “I fought you assholes in ‘Nam.” The driver nodded. “He fought y’assholes in ‘Nam!” Dog’s smile grew to obscene proportions.

Not being one to let a statement like this go unchallenged, German Shepard immediately rose to the occasion and jabbed a paw in the man’s face. “WOOOOOOOOF!” His paw trembled with rage while Dog suppressed a guffaw. The redneck stared at him in confusion.

“…Wot?”

 German Shepard punched him in the mouth.

 The redneck tumbled over, knocking his compatriot out his seat and onto the pavement. Dog was on him in a flash, hauling him up and securing his arms behind his back with an unhealthy cracking of joints.One-eye regained his composure admirably, and stepped out in front of German Shepard. “Y’ stupid god damned commie, you god damned near broke my fuckin’ face! What are ya, salty because you lost the fuckin’ war?” 

It was too much—such an insult to his Russian patriotism could not be allowed to stand. Grasping the man in his jaws he lifted the man off the ground by his neck and carted him off towards a dead, wiry tree. The cowboy flailed wildly, trying to strike him or push him away, but German Shepard had a considerable size advantage. He briefly considered hanging the man, but lacking the rope to do so decided to secure him to the tree with one-eye’s belt, Dog doing the same with the other. Two oversized lone star belt buckles shone in the hot southern sun as Dog and German Shepard stalked away to their truck, leaving them to bake for a while. 

“WHOOF!?” Dog quipped as he climbed into the driver’s seat. They drove for hours down the Texas highway, finding nothing but dust and clumps of rocks. German Shepard watched idly from the passenger seat, finding the vastness of the state reminding him somewhat of home, if much drier.

Far behind, the two cowboys were delighted to see a black SUV pull off the road, with uniformed men disembarking and approaching them quickly. “It’s about bloody time you got here,” one-eye said haughtily.

“Did they take the truck?” Both of them nodded.

“…Excellent. We’ve got them now.”

-----

"Arf," Dog grimaced.

"Woof," German Shepard offered.

"Arf?" Dog retorted.

"Bark!" German Shepard snarled.

"WOOOF~! BARK BARK BARK BARK BARK!," Dog screamed, nearly going into histrionics.

"WOOF!!?" German Shepard shouted back, slamming his fists on the hood of the broken-down Ford.

"Bark!!" Dog screamed.

That was when the two men heard a car horn honk behind them. They turned to see a cherry-red Camaro convertible with the top down idling by the side of the road. The car gleamed like a jewel. 

So did the three babes riding it.

The driver was a brunette, her long, curly locks flowing over her bare shoulders, her honeyed skin glowing with sweat from the warm Texas sun. Her red lips were pursed playfully as she lowered her sunglasses and gave the two strangers a slightly amused look. Her friend in the passenger's side seat (a tanned blonde with flawless skin and gorgeous green eyes) leaned over and waved, while the redhead in the back seat popped her gum and winked.

"Hey boys," the brunette said. "Seems like you're having a little car trouble. Need a lift?"

"Woof," German Shepard said.

"Well, it's a tight fit, but squeeze in! We'll give you a ride to town!" the brunette said. She got up and opened the door of the camaro. Dog and German Shepard could see that all three of the women were wearing daisy dukes, sandals, and not much else. All of them had bodies that would make supermodels green with envy, their voluptuous figures threatening to free themselves from their straining tops at any moment.

Dog and German Shepard gave each other a bemused look, their argument from moments before forgotten. "Woof," Dog whispered.

"Bark," German Shepard whispered.

Dog shook his head as he saw German Shepard climb into the back seat, sandwiched by the blonde on one side and the redhead on the other, grinning as the two scantily clad women pressed up against him. He turned his eyes to the sky, beseechingly. "Woof," he whispered.

He got in the car anyway.

------

“Bark?” Dog asked above the purr of the Camaro’s engine. The brunette next to him just smiled and shook her head.

They had driven for hours. Dog and German Shepard had no idea where they were, but it wasn’t really a concern—they were more than content to allow the girls to fawn over them as much as they pleased. Dog sat in the front seat with the blonde in his lap, one arm around her waist and the other holding a drink. He whispered witty compliments in her ear like a suave Latin lover, making her laugh coyly and teasingly flick him on the nose. She smiled softly and threw her head back to check on German Shepard and the redhead, her golden mane swishing across Dog’s face as it twirled around.

“Er, what is he doing?” She asked Dog, tapping him on the shoulder. He craned his head to look, hearing a sound that could only be likened to “blblblbblblblblb”.

“Woof.” She gave him a quizzical look, and German Shepard looked up from the other woman’s bosom long enough to say, "Woof.” 

She giggled and handed him another drink, which he held forward to Dog and toasted, the girls’ smiles widening. Their heads lolled about and they couldn’t help but notice that the telephone poles were whizzing by like blurs, the road becoming a mishmash of grays and whites from the evenly painted dividing lines. The sky spun like a top and together they fell into the darkness. 

"Well, they're out," the blonde said.

The other two girls sighed and relaxed. "I thought they'd never drop," the brunette muttered. "Seriously, how much flunitrazepam did we slip them, anyway?"

"About three times the normal dose," the redhead sighed, pushing German Shepard away and buttoning up her shirt. "This guy was motorboating me all the way to the end, too."

"Well, we're done now," sighed the blonde. "Now it's time for the boys to do their work."

The red convertible pulled into a side street that didn't appear on any maps. The black SUV reached them shortly after.

-----

Wherever they were, it was freezing. They awoke groggily and were aware of only the blindfolds and the bindings around their hands and feet, the scuffling sounds they made echoing throughout the empty concrete room. A door opened and shut from behind them, and they heard the sound of boots on pavement approaching and circling them. Harsh light assaulted their eyes without warning when the blindfolds were abruptly torn off, a trio of unhappy looking men stand before them. They wore crisply pressed and immaculately tailored military style uniforms and were backlit by a naked incandescent light bulb.

It took a moment for their eyes to adjust enough to be able to make out the GOC insignia printed on their breast pockets.

“Bark?” German Shepard asked, blinking.

“The data is, shall we say, ‘redacted’, as your people are so fond of putting it,” responded one of the men.

“Wang,” Dog sighed exasperatedly.

"No, we are not fucking with you," the man in the uniform said. He pulled up a chair and sat across from the two men. A golden eagle insignia on his uniform collar gleamed in the dim light. "We are through fucking with you. From this point forward, we are being serious." 

He pulled out a silver Zippo lighter with the words 'FUCK COMMUNISM' written on the side and lit up a large, black cigar. Clouds of acrid smoke billowed from the stogie, filling the room with dense white vapors. "Now," the colonel said. "You are going to tell us exactly what you two Foundation personnel were doing heading into a GOC operation in progress. What is your game? What are you trying to accomplish here?"

Dog and German Shepard glanced at each other, then turned back to the colonel. "Woof," Dog muttered.

"Arf," German Shepard said.

"Bow wow," Dog added.

"Wan wan," German Shepard said.

"Arf!"

"Woof!"

"Bow wow," Dog concluded.

The colonel pulled a boot knife from the bag next to him and stuck it, point-down, into the table. "Armed pretty heavily for a bunch of guys on vacation," the colonel pointed out, taking out a bunch of knives and small explosives from the bag next to him and laying them out on the table. 

"Woof," Dog pointed out.

"Arf," German Shepard added.

"Bow wow?"

"Woof."

"Really. So. . . you aren't on a secret mission for the Foundation? You aren't the backup called in by a Foundation operative six days ago in response to escalating KTE activity?"

"Woof."

"Bow wow," German Shepard insisted.

"Really," murmured the colonel. He gestured to the screen behind him. The image of a calico cat appeared on the screen, flanked by gun-toting soldiers. "This is from our Rio de Janeiro office. Does this cat look familiar?"

The cat raised his head groggily and stared at the screen. His eyes lit up. "Meow!" Agent Kitty meowed. "Meow meow?"

The two dogs stared at Kitty for a moment, then glanced at each other, then looked back at the colonel. "Woof," Dog lied.

"Woof," German Shepard said.

"HISSSS!" Kitty whimpered.

-----

". . . and what happened after that?" Dr. Glass asked. The psychiatrist was resting his chin on his hand, gazing at the three animals sitting in his office with an expression of spellbound fascination.

"Woof," Dog said.

"Bow wow," German Shepard finished.

"Arf!"

"Woof," German Shepard corrected.

"Woof?" Dog wondered.

"Woof," German Shepard explained pointedly.

Dog blinked once, very slowly, then smiled. "Bow wow!

"Woof!" German Shepard said, much relieved. "Bow wow."

"Woof."

"I see," Glass said, very slowly. "And this is why you guys were late coming back from vacation?"

"Woof," Dog said.

"Bark."

"Meow," Kitty whimpered.

"Woof."

"Disguised. . . as tourists," Glass repeated.

"Woof."

"I see. And this explains the. . ." Glass ran an eye down the page of the document in front of him. ". . . six nights at a luxury 4-star hotel, five thousand-plus dollars in restaurant and liquor bills, and. . . good lord, you bought HOW many condoms? And why six bikinis?"

"Woof," Dog said.

". . . Dr. Dog. My dear agents. I was not born yesterday. The Foundation Expense Fund is for emergency expenses in the line of duty. It is not to be used to fund a week of debauchery on the taxpayers' dollar, and your ludicrous story is both insulting to my intelligence and. . ."

Simultaneously, as if they had rehearsed this (and perhaps they had), the three animals reached into the breast pockets of their hawaiian shirts and pulled out three newspaper clippings and laid them on the desk in front of Glass.

**HERO DOGS SAVE PLANE**

**TEXAS MILITIAMEN FOUND CASTRATED IN DESERT**

**BLOODSHED IN RIO! TWO MYSTERY DOGS ATTACK BRAZILIAN MILITARY BASE**

Glass looked from one newspaper clipping to the other, then back up at the three animals. 

He saw Kitty lick his butt.

He saw Dog lighting up a cigarette with a battered, blood-stained Zippo, with the words "FUCK COMMUNISM" engraved on it.

He saw German Shepard grin, his mouth full of steel teeth, his broad, slavic face the very picture of angelic innocence.

Dr. Glass took a deep breath and buried his face in his hands.

"You have to be fucking with me," he moaned.

END
