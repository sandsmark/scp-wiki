A carp can transform into a dragon by successfully climbing up a Dragon's Gate waterfall. However, for people who aren't able to go to one of those waterfalls, or for someone who wants to transform a specific carp into a dragon, this is the way to go.[[footnote]] Or for someone with a great deal of patience, apparently. -Speaker [[/footnote]]

//This is Sharkie,[[footnote]] Sharkie is a Doitsu koi. Fortunately, when bred with a properly-scaled male, the offspring are always scaled koi. Performing this ritual with a Doitsu koi is what I like to call a bad idea. Dragons generally need their scales, after all!

Caution is advised. -Speaker [[/footnote]]//

**Traits:** This ritual must be performed outdoors or in an open-air environment, and with a body of water and waterfall which are not completely sterile[[footnote]] Yes, this means that it needs plants and other critters in there. Yes, this means that the carp is probably going to get distracted by eating instead of jumping the waterfall. Yes, this is frustrating as everything. [[/footnote]] except for the carp, or it will not work. An adult[[footnote]] Adult in this case means of breeding age and exceeding a foot, although the fish in question can be sterile. "Cheating" the measurements by using a long-finned carp occasionally works, but it's best not to risk it. [[/footnote]] carp[[footnote]] Ctenopharyngodon, Cyprinus, Hypophthalmichthys, Mylopharyngodon, Carassius, and Cirrhinus carp are all viable options. Make sure you know what carp you are using before beginning the ritual.  [[/footnote]] must be used in this ritual, or the best-case scenario is that it will not work[[footnote]] I still haven't found [http://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/the-hybrid the tench/koi hybrid], and quite frankly I don't know how it survived. [[/footnote]]. A sizable waterfall is necessary, but don't worry, it doesn't have to be nearly as big as the one at Henan. Simply create or find a waterfall large enough to be a challenge[[footnote]] Some fish are better jumpers than others, and your ritual must take the jumping ability of that particular fish into account! [[/footnote]] to the carp, and it will work.

**Nature:** This ritual is basically an emulation ritual for harnessing the natural transformative magic of the wild Dragon's Gate ritual and placing it in a smaller, more accessible scale. The reason it works is by convincing reality that this is an acceptable substitute for the real deal. It's certainly not the only way to turn a fish into a dragon, but it's the least risky[[footnote]] By least risky, Laurie means that the ritual will not explode in one's face and that the carp will remain completely unharmed. That being said, the foci can and will be destroyed if something goes wrong, and shrapnel is a concern. Wear goggles, or have a heavy meal after an accident. -Speaker [[/footnote]] way to do it as long as you follow all the rules.

**History & Associated Parties:** This ritual has been practically unchanged since it was discovered in China, at least according to whoever wrote the English language translation I use. Now if only they weren't allergic to providing names and dates...

Generally, it was used more politically than anything else. Create a dragon for a certain ruler's reign as a sign of heavenly approval or just a general good omen, and hope said ruler doesn't screw up enough to be eaten by said dragon. That being said, it's always been important to remember that these are made from carp, which can and will eat anything that fits in their mouth. Poking at a new dragon was and still is a good way to become the first meal of ascension.[[footnote]] In my experience, dragons created by this ritual tend not to be as bright as their wild counterparts, so it's a very good idea to stay away from them until they get their bearings, unless the dragon recognizes you from being a carp. [[/footnote]] Most of the time, rituals were performed away from anyone important who could get eaten.[[footnote]] Presuming you don't consider the practitioner important, which any sensible person should. -Speaker [[/footnote]]

**Approach:** As stated before, you're going to need a body of water, a waterfall, a suitable adult carp, and a lot of patience. Place two imbued carp effigies[[footnote]] Preferably made of natural materials such as clay or wood. Stone and metal work too, although you have to put more magic into them. Anything really derived, like plastic, is more touch-and-go.  [[/footnote]]^^,^^[[footnote]] These don't have to be good effigies, the practitioner simply needs to know what they represent. Obviously, since these are things Laurie's made herself. -Speaker [[/footnote]]^^,^^[[footnote]] Wow, thanks. Asshole. [[/footnote]] at the base of the waterfall, and two imbued dragons at the top of the waterfall. This tells reality that this is a Dragon's Gate waterfall, despite being smaller than most of the natural ones. These will also have patterns carved in to redirect the backlash from the working into something manageable. Once you've made all of the preparations, the only thing you can do is wait for the carp to jump the falls on its own time. You can use prior training to try and convince it to jump, but otherwise interfering with the ritual is a bad idea.[[footnote]] You can lose a hand if you aren't careful. Or a leg. -Speaker [[/footnote]]

**Other Detail:** A general feature of the "permitted" carp to go through this ritual is that they are all very heavy-bodied, and very hungry. Goldfish and koi work best for this ritual because you can train them to jump the waterfall in return for a reward, while other carp may simply ignore the waterfall in favor of eating whatever they can find in the main body of water.

The Threshold of the Dragon's Gate

"Beneath the serene quiet of the water lilies 
a young carp senses a calling ... swelling up in her heart 
like the swirling waters at the base of a great waterfall, 
Somehow summoned to go beyond the barrier
of crashing water and veiled mist
The churning waters of the waterfall’s bottom
matches that of the young carp’s desires

Finally with a burst of enthusiasm the carp has launched herself 
up the wall of rushing water 
cresting the first falls with a surge of effort
only to be met with relentless rushing water.
Persevering from one cataract to the next
the carp makes it to the summit’s last falls.
Regrouping her energies in a pocket of scouring effervescence
every essence of strength, courage, and spirit is consumed
in the launching over the fall’s summit.

And the dragon’s gate accepts her efforts a transforming gate of fire
Revealing the birth of a new Dragon
born of the seed of desire planted in the heart of a small carp 
that once hid in the shallows."
-  Howard Schroeder, Threshold of the Dragon's Gate

"Redfin Carp pledged a solemn vow.  "I shall swim beyond the Dragon Gates.  I shall brave the perilous bolts of fire and lightning.  I shall transcend the estate of ordinary fish and achieve a place among the order of sacred dragons.  I shall rid myself forever of the terrible suffering to which my race is heir, expunge every trace of our shame and humiliation."    

Waiting until the third day of the third month, when the peach blossoms are in flower and the river is full, he made his way to the entrance of the Yü Barrier.  Then, with a flick of his tail, Redfin Carp swam forth.

You men have never laid eyes on the awesome torrent of water that rolls through the Dragon Gates.  It falls all the way from the summits of the far-off Kunlun Range with tremendous force.  There are wild, thousand foot waves that rush down through gorges towering to dizzying heights on either side, carrying away whole hillsides as they go.  Angry bolts of thunder beat down with a deafening roar.  Moaning whirlwinds whip up poisonous mists and funnels of noisome vapor spitting flashing forks of lightening.  The mountain spirits are stunned into senselessness; the river spirits turn limp with fright.  Just a drop of this water will shatter the carapace of the giant tortoise, it will break the bones of the giant whale.

It was into this maelstrom that Redfin Cary, his splendid golden-red scales girded to the full, his steely teeth thrumming like drums, made a direct all-out assault.  Ah!  Golden Carp!  Golden Carp!  You might have led an ordinary life out in the boundless ocean.  It teems with lesser fish.  You would not have gone hungry.  Then why?  What made you embark on this wild and bitter struggle:  What was waiting for you up beyond the Barrier?

Suddenly, after being seared by cliff-shattering bolts of lightning, after being battered by heaven scorching blast of thunder-fire, his scaly armor burnt from head to tail, his fins singed through, Redfin Carp perished into the Great Death and rose again as a divine dragon─ a supreme lord of the waters.  Now, with the thunder god at his head and a fire god at his rear, flanked right and left with the gods of rain and wind, he moves abroad with the clouds in one hand and mists in the other, bringing new life to the tender young shoots withering in the long parched desert lands, keeping the true Dharma safe amid the defilements of the degenerate world.

Had he been content to pass his life like a lame turtle or blind tortoise, feeding on winkles and tiny shrimps, not even all the effort Vasuki, Manasvi, and the other Dragon Kings might muster on his behalf could have done him any good.  He could never have achieved the great success that he did."

**Doubt**
[[/=]]

As the editor for this, and a witness to more than a few of these rituals, I can't really agree with the idea that they're stupider than wild dragons. I'd swear that they know more than they let on. -Speaker[[footnote]] I think you're supposed to use your initials, buddy. [[/footnote]]^^,^^[[footnote]] I don't have initials, Laurie. Maybe I could add my previous nickname in there, but since I no longer believe in the idea of some "grand justice," Judicator Speaker would look exceptionally stupid. -Speaker [[/footnote]]^^,^^[[footnote]] Wait, you called yourself Judicator? [[/footnote]]^^,^^[[footnote]] I was young. Everyone makes mistakes when they're young, even shapeshifters. -Speaker [[/footnote]]^^,^^[[footnote]] I'm never forgetting this. [[/footnote]]^^,^^[[footnote]] Of course you aren't. -Speaker [[/footnote]]
