**Item #:** SCP-1142

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1142 is to be contained in a standard non-humanoid holding cell at Site-12. An automated recording system is to monitor SCP-1142 at all times. Two Level 2 members of technical staff are to inspect any recordings made on a daily basis and in case of a transmission having been picked up, are to provide this transmission to the current translation operative for conversion from its original German into English. A full report is then to be submitted to the current level 4 project lead as per the protocols for interdimensional relations. The battery SCP-1142 carries is to be checked on the first of every month for signs of deterioration. Its propulsion systems have been disabled to simplify containment.

**Description:** SCP-1142 is a Goliath tracked mine (original designation //Leichter Ladungsträger Goliath (Sd.Kfz. 303b)//) as used by the German Wehrmacht during the Second World War. It shows no signs of aging and although originally designed to carry an explosive charge, SCP-1142 carries a heavily modified Kw.E.a Wehrmacht radio receiver within its housing. The modified components are of a design and complexity inconsistent with the level of German technology during the first half of the twentieth century. The vehicle relies on a gasoline engine for propulsion and carries a early model thermal battery for the operation of the receiver. 

At irregular intervals, transmissions in German have been recorded from SCP-1142. In all cases, contact has been made by an individual referring to himself as Brigadeführer ████ ███████ (designated SCP-1142-1). Historical research has verified his existence, though records show him to have been killed during Allied military action at █████ on ██/██/19██. Analysis of transmissions recorded have yielded several critical points of divergence from our timeline. These include:

* Several individuals not currently known to have held offices within the Wehrmacht occupying key positions within that body

* Large-scale deaths among German civilians from an unknown pathogen with symptoms resembling acute necrotizing fasciitis

* A sinkhole with a radius of approximately eight kilometers appearing in the Lublin province of Poland in late 19██

* Reports of mass destruction of German settlements by unknown forces

* Allied powers isolating the European continent, with troop action being focused on containment of [REDACTED]

* Development of dimensional gating technology in 19██

In addition, SCP-1142-1 claims to be broadcasting from ██████████, Austria in the year 19██. In light of this and the aforementioned divergences, transmissions received through SCP-1142 are deemed to be interdimensional. The dimension of origin for these transmissions has been designated Dm-AX/15487-A. Additional classification as intertemporal is pending.

At this time, communications are restricted to receiving and recording the signal broadcast by SCP-1142-1 from Dm-AX/15487-A; attempts to initiate contact with or send a signal to Dm-AX/15487-A have proven ineffectual. Further research into initiating contact with SCP-1142-1 or responding to his transmissions has been suspended.

SCP-1142 was discovered in a barn on the outskirts of Fürstenzell, Germany on ██/██/20██. German authorities, alerted by the owner found the object idling and, after recognizing its original purpose, brought in the Kampfmittelräumdienst (KRD) to defuse it. A covert contact within that service alerted local Foundation agents when she found the object showed no signs of age and did in fact not contain an explosive charge. A recovery team then managed to extract the object from the German authorities and transported it to Site-12.
