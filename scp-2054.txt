**Item #:** SCP-2054

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2054 is incarcerated at the maximum security wing of the humanoid detention center at Site-23.  All nutritional and medical requirements are to be provided by autonomous means, as are weekly interrogations. Under no circumstances are any personnel to have any physical contact with SCP-2054. Once a week, exercise is permitted under armed guard in the maximum security rehabilitation center. Standard amenities package EEF-115 are to be extended to SCP-2054 as long as it remain cooperative. 

**Description:** SCP-2054 is a metamorphic entity capable of assuming the appearance of other human beings. No means have been discovered of distinguishing between SCP-2054 and its human target.

**Recovery Log:** SCP-2054's existence was first hypothesized using inferential statistical models developed to assess the possibility that the Foundation had been infiltrated by inimical agents. Developed by Dr. Martin F██████ with the cooperation of the Statistical Section in 2002, a non-zero probability was assigned to the contingency. A research team was empaneled to develop means of identifying said agents.

Shortly after the investigation began, Dr. F██████ alerted security that he was being accosted in his quarters. When security arrived, two identical copies of Dr. F██████ were discovered in the midst of a struggle. Both were tranquilized and quarantined pending further investigation. 

During the subsequent security sweep, the whereabouts of Researcher Nancy Y█████ -- a colleague of Dr. F██████ -- could not be established. The operating assumption was made that Researcher Y█████ had been compromised by SCP-2054 sometime in the past, and that SCP-2054 had then sought to copy and dispose of Dr. F██████, thereby eliminating any chance of its being discovered.

Researcher Nancy Y█████, employed by the Foundation since 1977, had been responsible for the analysis and containment procedures of several Keter-class acquisitions. These acquisitions were immediately assigned priority-one reassessment. To date, no related containment breaches have occurred.

During questioning, no means of distinguishing between SCP-2054 and Dr. F██████ were discovered. Both possessed the same faculties, apparent memories, including classified information such as duress codes, encryption protocols etc. Physical and medical assays proved equally unproductive.

Coercive interrogation measures were then sanctioned, including procedures 221-Crenshaw and 622-Atlantic, both to no avail. Out of humanitarian considerations, these interrogation methods have since been scaled back to once a week.

> __Transcript__: Conversation between SCP-2054/Antwerp and a colleague, Dr. Amal Patel
>> //Patel//: Martin, this is intolerable. I can't imagine what you're going through. I'm meeting with the Ethics Committee later today and I'm going to raise holy hell.
>> 
>> //F██████//: I appreciate that, Amal, I really do. This is going to take time. I suppose the irony hasn't been lost on you that...that in attempting to identify the impostor, I've become the prime suspect.
>> 
>> //Patel//: I'm glad to see your humor hasn't abandoned you. This is Kafkaesque. 
>> 
>>  //F██████//: It is isn't it? Or Dostoevsky... How is the team holding up?
>> 
>> Patel: Well, you know Richardson. He maintains that he warned us about this possibility.... though he's treating this as empirical validation of the theory.
>> 
>>  //F██████//: (chuckles). Asshole. We never imagined an impostor in our very working group.
>> 
>> //Patel//: Samantha is nearly catatonic with guilt. 
>> 
>>  //F██████//: Please let her know I don't blame her. Tell her Risk Management did its due diligence. She went over it three times. She pushed to have an impartial supervisory board.
>> 
>> //Patel//: I know, Martin, and I'll tell her. Martin, they've only given each of us 5 minutes. Dr Chinaski wants to talk to you next. Please... take care. And be careful. Watch your back.
>> 
>>  //F██████:// I will. And Amal... thanks for looking in on me. Do they... are you going to talk to the other...
>> 
>> //Patel:// No. I can't bring myself to.
>> 
>> //F██████:// Well, consider doing it. It can maybe help me get out of here. How can you be sure I'm the real...
>> 
>> //Patel:// I don't know how you can remain so calm.
>> 
>> //F██████:// Crying about it won't help.
>> 
>> //Patel:// Well... take care... Martin.
>> 
>>  //F██████:// You too.

> __Transcript__: Conversation between SCP-2054/Baltimore and advocate-designate Ellis McPhee
> 
>> //McPhee:// The ethics committee has denied my request. Formally. I'm sorry.  In two weeks time, you're to be officially re-classified as SCP-2054-Baltimore. Your counterpart, SCP-2054-Antwerp. Do you realize what this means?
>> 
>> //F██████:// That I didn't get top billing? (laughs) <//pause of 20 seconds//>. Yes. Yes, I realize what this means... What are they starting with?
>> 
>> //McPhee//: ... the, uh... it's the standard coercive battery indicated for non-responsive detainees.
>> 
>>  //F██████:// Well... well... I guess that's... decent of them. What about the other one.
>> 
>> //McPhee:// I've been forbidden to discuss the disposition of the other one... I can't even meet with its advocate to see if...
>> 
>> //F██████:// No, no. I understand.
>> 
>> //McPhee:// Do you need anything?
>> 
>> //F██████:// No, I'm good... actually, can you see about getting me some non-classified research to work on? I have too much time on my hands.
>>  
>> //McPhee:// Well, I don't see why not. At least during the next two weeks. I'll submit a formal request.
>> 
>>  //F██████:// I was sure we'd find something with mitochondrial fractionation. Or with fMRI.
>> 
>> //McPhee:// I know it's easier said than done, but try not to give up hope. We still have two weeks.
>> 
>> //F██████:// OK.
>> 
>> //McPhee:// There've been rumors over the years...about the palliative use of amnestics on wrongly...
>> 
>> //F██████:// ...wrongly accused subjects. After...after interrogation. I've heard that too.
>> 
>> //McPhee:// Right.
>> 
>> //F██████:// Well. Its a strange epistemological question. Will unremembered torture never have existed? In any case, you can appreciate I'd rather not be the Ethics Committee's  test case.
>> 
>> //McPhee:// Try to be calm. I'll see you tomorrow.

> __Transcript__: SCP-2054 Baltimore and interrogator Alison Lawrence
>>   
>> //Lawrence//: It's time.
>>  
>> //Baltimore//: Why. Why must this be done to me.
>>  
>> //Lawrence//: If you are Dr F██████, then you'll understand. SCP-2054 may have masqueraded within the Foundation for decades. We can't know when Nancy Y█████ was compromised. The danger is unimaginable.
>>  
>> //Baltimore//: I understand that. I do. Very well. I commissioned the probability models,  for Christ's sake.
>>  
>> //Lawrence//: Please don't aggravate yourself needlessly.
>>  
>> //Baltimore//: Can you offer any... what can I... suggest something I can say to prove to you...
>>  
>> //Lawrence//: Personally, I think you //are// the impostor. Not that it matters, really. Ultimately.
>>  
>> //Baltimore//: Bullshit
>> 
>> //Lawrence// Hold on. Just a moment. Just a moment. I've just been informed that the results are back. I see. I see. Yes. Yes, thanks. Believe me I will. You're the impostor. The real Dr. F██████ is being released. You are to be reclassified as an enemy combatant. As such, you no longer enjoy certain rights. Or any consideration whatsoever. It's now at my discretion to employ 662-Atlantic. Or not.
>>  
>> //Batlimore//: I know you're lying. There's no test. I'm sure your counterpart is saying the same to the impostor. You're the liar.
>>  
>> //Lawrence//: It is unfortunate you think so.
>>  
>> //Baltimore//: Damn it. Get on with it. What are you waiting for? I know you're trying to play me. Let's get this over with. It's a consolation of sorts that the other is getting the same. It'll break. I'm ready now. I said I'm ready. Get on with it. 
>> 
>> //Lawrence//: Perhaps you should consider the possibility that you only //think// you're the real Dr. F██████. 
>>  
>> //Baltimore//: ...I've considered that...I have considered that but that's not my worry... I'd say its yours. Its clear whats going to happen next. Have you considered that I //am// who I say I am? Your chances are fifty-fifty, aren't they? Get on with it will you? I said get on with it.

> __Transcript__: During their incarceration, SCP-2054 Antwerp/Baltimore were at times allowed to communicate via CCTV. In mind of the so-called Ypsilanti experiment,[[footnote]]A psychiatric case study concerning an  experiment on a group of three paranoid schizophrenic patients, each of whom believed himself to be Christ. The patients were made to confront each other, ultimately resulting in one of them recovering[[/footnote]] it was hoped that this might provoke the impostor and help resolve which was the authentic Dr. F██████.

>> //Antwerp//: They'll figure it out, you know. Eventually. They're very motivated.
>> 
>> //Baltimore//: You're very funny. Do you realize I'm the only one you can't fool?
>>  
>> //Antwerp//: In the end, they'll keep you alive. But they will dissect you. Whether it's performed with or without anesthetic is entirely up to you
>>  
>> //Baltimore//: You won't succeed in shocking me. 
>>  
>> //Antwerp//: I'm not trying to shock you.
>>  
>> //Baltimore//: I'm guessing you've provided them with my entire life-story. And that it's verbatim, the same as mine. I suppose, well it's possible, you might not even be aware you're an impostor. Maybe a form of... of... that assimilates periodically, but isn't completely aware of what it's... for... like Lawrence Harvey. In the Manchurian Candidate. An oblivious double-agent.
>>  
>> //Antwerp//: How fascinating. You realize the same applies to you.
>>  
>> //Baltimore//: Ha!
>>   
>> //Antwerp//: "Ha!"
>>  
>> //Baltimore//: Ha, yourself.

>>  
>> //Baltimore//: ....yeah, chess? A round of chess? The game? Not the musical?

>> //Baltimore//: e5, then.
>> 
>> //Antwerp//: f5.

>> 
>> //Baltimore//: Better than you. Better than you...
>> 
>> //Antwerp//: My advocate says...never mind.
>> 
>> //Baltimore//: What does he say?
>> 
>> //Antwerp//: He says...he said that its the only way to exonerate me. Otherwise my confinement will be permanent.

>> //Baltimore//: He's got a hell of a sense of a humor.

>> 
>> //Antwerp//: "Rosencrantz"?
>> 
>> //Baltimore//: Yes, "Guildenstern"?
>> 
>> //Antwerp//: They'll never let us out of here.
>> 
>> //Baltimore//: I know... I know. We both know. Did you have the dream again?
>> 
>> //Antwerp//: Not recently.
>> 
>> //Baltimore//: I did, last night. There was something new. I was torturing you, you wept, I felt horrible... but you...whispered something to me.
>> 
>> //Antwerp//: What? What did I whisper?
>> 
>> //Baltimore:// You whispered...you whispered..."I forgive you."
>> 
>> //Antwerp:// Well, for the record, I don't.
>> 
>> //Baltimore//: Well, for the record, I have. You can't help what you are. Anymore than I can.
>> 
>> //Antwerp//: ... are you having a sentimental spasm?
>> 
>> //Baltimore//: (laughs) perhaps.

**Unclassified Experimentation/Interrogation Methodology:**
[[collapsible show="+ [open methodology]" hide="- [close methodology]"]]
__A list of inconclusive tests performed:__

Medical examinations have included such tests as fMRI, PET and CAT scan, spinal infusion, Van Slack determination, cellular mitotic assay, genomic analysis, and dendrite differential reaction.

Physical examinations have included such tests as differential spectroscopy, iNFR meson decay probing, deBroglie interference defraction, molecular recombination, matter/antimatter pair-production analysis, and gravitational and intertial mass discrepancy 

Psychological examinations have included such tests as Rorscharch, MMPI, Bender-Gestal, recall of random word lists, reaction times to random stimuli, reaction times to negative stimuli, and pain threshold. Much of this methodology was borrowed by the differential diagnosis used in the case of Dissociative Identity Disorder (formerly, Multiple Personality Disorder). While initially a seemingly promising line of inquiry, it proved as inconclusive as the others.

A containment breach was faked and security was withdrawn in order to observe how the pair might react. Both made their way to the prearranged rally point where they surrendered to security without incident. 

At various times, interrogation measures have been relaxed in order to allow the putative original to formulate his own avenues of research. It can be assumed that that he was strongly motivated.

SCP-2054 Antwerp/Batimore have sometimes been interrogated jointly. At others times, either one of the two was permitted to observe the interrogation of the other, and to suggest lines of questioning.

Over time, various confessions were extracted from each of them, but none that were dispositive, and none that provided any conclusive proof.

__Note__: The only difference between their official testimonies has been the account they gave of the initial encounter with the double. SCP-2054/Antwerp described it as being a diffuse, translucent, light emitting body. SCP-2054/Baltimore maintained that it had already assumed his appearance, perhaps attempting to shock him and thereby gain the advantage. No meaningful avenues of research, however, have been suggested by this discrepancy.

**Addendum:** Due to the effects of the situation on staff morale, amnestics were approved and prescribed to Dr. F██████'s colleagues. The cover story was released that Dr. F██████ was KIA.

In 2014, either SCP-2054 or Dr. F██████ committed suicide in its/his cell during an unrelated containment breach. Autopsy results provided nothing definitive. The survivor has since been placed on suicide watch. At such time as the survivor expires, Dr. F██████ will become eligible for the Thaumiel medal of honor.
