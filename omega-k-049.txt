[[include component:image-block name=http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--resized-images/scp-049/SCP-049/medium.jpg|caption=SCP-049.]]

**Item #:** SCP-049

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-049 has been granted Level-2 Clearance and is allowed to work up to 30 hours a week as clerical staff or as a surgical consult within Site-19's Medical Bay. While working, SCP-049 is to be supervised by at least one armed guard personnel at all times. 

When not within Site-19's Medical Bay, SCP-049 is to remain within a standard humanoid containment chamber in Research Sector-02. Weekly visits from a Level-3 approved psychiatrist[[footnote]] Currently Dr. Leopold Isaac [[/footnote]] have been scheduled.

**Description:** SCP-049 is a humanoid entity, roughly 1.9 meters in height, which bears the appearance of a medieval plague doctor. While SCP-049 appears to be wearing the thick robes and the ceramic mask indicative of that profession, the garments instead seem to have grown out of SCP-049's body over time[[footnote]]The robes and gloves are identical to a thick hide built up on the skin, while the mask is composed of a kind of chitin growing out of the bones of the face.[[/footnote]], and are now nearly indistinguishable from whatever form is beneath them. X-rays indicate that despite this, SCP-049 does have a humanoid skeletal structure beneath its outer layer.

SCP-049 is capable of speech in a variety of languages, though tends to prefer English or medieval French[[footnote]]The entity claims to have originated in 15th century France, though admits that it is "[[[excerpts-from-the-medical-tragedy-of-dr-bartholomew-artz-aut|particularly well-traveled]]]".[[/footnote]]. While SCP-049 is generally cooperative with Foundation personnel, it will commonly enter periods of lethargy and apathy. 

SCP-049 was capable of causing all biological functions of an organism to cease through direct skin contact, and possessed an obsession in pursuing a cure for what it referred to as "The Pestilence." These effects have not been observed to manifest since the onset of ΩK.


**Addendum 049.2020.1: Incident Report N321357Y3V**

On September 12th, 2020, SCP-049 entered a manic state and began pounding on the doors of its containment chamber, demanding to speak with Dr. Itkin. While waiting for meeting arrangements to be finalized, SCP-049 proceeded to destroy its desk and damage the frame of its bed.

Guard Personnel Cedric Guiles (ID: 755632) was penalized for failing to restrain SCP-049 prior to Dr. Itkin engaging the object. Emphasis on Special Containment Procedure training has been applied.

**Addendum 049.2020.2**

SCP-049 suffered two gunshot wounds in its lower abdomen during Incident N321357Y3V. Due to the object's unnatural biology and the sudden failure of general anesthesia[[footnote]] This has since been confirmed to be an effect of the ongoing ΩK "End of Death" Scenario. [[/footnote]], the planned surgery to remove the bullets and close the wounds inflicted onto SCP-049 was delayed. Following a 2 hour period of continued delays, SCP-049 demanded to be allowed to treat itself. The request was granted.

SCP-049 was observed to conduct the procedure on itself using its own surgical instruments. 

Dr. Itkin was briefed on the recently discovered ΩK "End of Death" Scenario and prompted to speak to SCP-049 24 hours after the completion of its procedure.

> **Itkin:** I'll take that as an affirmative. Now, you said that you no longer had access to an important ingredient in your 'cure'. Given what I now know, it is our belief that death was part, if not the cure to what you claim to be 'the pestilence.' Is that correct?

> **SCP-049:** No, doctor. The cure is not something you or your organization would understand. No matter how much you claim to understand me, my methods, the pestilence, and my cure, the fact of the matter is that despite all that I tell you, you never really listen.

> **Itkin:** Well, technically yes. 
> 
> **SCP-049:** But it would not be a true wine.
> 
> **Itkin:** I mean, yeah, I guess, but what does this have to do with anything?
> 
> **SCP-049:** But it does, Doctor Itkin. I cannot make my cure without the most important ingredient, just as one cannot make a proper wine without grapes. 
> 
> **Itkin:** So you were aware of Omega-K?
> 
> **SCP-049:** I do not know your organization's name for what has occurred, but I suppose the answer is yes. I do not know exactly what has transpired, but it has rendered me useless; a failure. Worst of all, the blame rests entirely on my shoulders.
> 
> **Itkin:** Are you saying you were responsible for this?
> 
> **SCP-049:** I should have been more forceful. For far too long I attempted to earn you and your organization's good graces. I attempted being a model prisoner, and I followed your commands as much as I was able to, all without compromising my mission to cure the Pestilence. 
> 
> {{[SCP-049 SIGHS]}}
> 
> **SCP-049:** It is only a matter of time before the Pestilence consumes the world at large. It is due to my own folly that I must observe as it affects all which I endeavored to save.  I am deeply sorry, Doctor Itkin. Soon you will be affected, just like Hamm, just like all the others, and I will be forced to sit idly by and watch.
> 
> **Itkin:** I see. Thank you for your time, 049.
> 
> **SCP-049:** No, doctor. Now you truly will not be able to see.

> [END LOG]

SCP-049 was returned to its containment chamber following a two-week recovery period. 

**Addendum 049.2021.3**

In the months following ΩK, SCP-049 was observed to exhibit common symptoms of depression, becoming lethargic, uninterested in inspecting its instruments, silent, and unwilling to speak about "the Pestilence". 

An appointment with the Site-19 psychiatry department was scheduled. SCP-049 was diagnosed with Depression after being found to have suffered multiple depressive episodes. No medication was prescribed due to the unknown effects it may have on the object's biology. Instead, SCP-049 was initiated on acognitive-behavioral psychotherapy program with Dr. Isaac.

**Addendum 049.2022.4**

SCP-049's condition was re-assessed following a six-month period, where no notable improvements were noted. Dr. Isaac's re-assessment concluded that the state of its depression had worsened and SCP-049 had grown more apathetic and lethargic than when it was first diagnosed. 

On 08/12/2022, the following proposal was submitted by Dr. Isaac.

PROPOSAL:
@@     @@"Allow SCP-049 to act as a surgical consult for the Site-19 Medical Ward. SCP-049 possesses an innate knowledge of human biology and has displayed its skill as a surgeon countless times. The entity is suffering extreme existential dread due to what it perceives as its failure to cure. By allowing it to work in the Medical Ward, I believe it will feel as if it is curing once more, and may be beneficial to its state of mental health."

SCP-049's total weekly work hours must not exceed 30. SCP-049 is to remain within the Site-19 Medical Wing without exception during its work hours and physical contact with patients is strictly forbidden until further notice.
[[/div]]


**Addendum 049.2022.5**

SCP-049's reassignment appears to have partly assuaged its depressive symptoms, however, it is still prone to lethargic episodes following surgeries where the patient suffers from post-operation complications. This has been deemed satisfactory for the anomaly's mental health. Further action is considered unnecessary.
