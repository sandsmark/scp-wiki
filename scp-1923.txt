**Item #:** SCP-1923

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to the distance and gravitational forces separating SCP-1923 and Earth, containment is currently considered //de facto//. In addition to the stationary camera on ███ ████████, camera probes are to be launched from Luna-█ to observe SCP-1923 on a regular basis. All pictures of ███ ██████ by non-Foundation organizations are to be doctored before public release. All signals originating from ███ ██████ are to be recorded and analyzed.

In the event of SCP-1923 (or any celestial body bearing SCP-1923) breaks its designated orbit, the Foundation is to enact [DATA EXPUNGED] procedures.

**Description:** SCP-1923 is fauna-like organism[[footnote]]Due to the inability of Foundation staff to interact with the material directly, it is currently assumed that SCP-1923 is plant-like. As the 'leaves' of SCP-1923 are green in color, the Foundation assumes that they are chlorophyllic in nature, for example.[[/footnote]] growing on the asteroid ███ ██████, located in the Sol system's asteroid belt. Originally believed to be a lichen-like growth covering the surface of the asteroid, higher-detail photos revealed that SCP-1923 is more akin to a terrestrial forest blanketing the surface, with green 'leaves' composing a dense canopy. Based on examining earlier photos of the asteroid, SCP-1923's canopy appears to be 95m above the surface of ███ ██████.

Due to the inability to casually observe SCP-1923, a stationary camera has placed on  ███ ████████, a nearby asteroid with a similar orbit to the one SCP-1923 inhabits.  Foundation technology does not, at this time, have the capability of providing high-quality photographs of SCP-1923 or the asteroid on which it exists. As such, all data concerning SCP-1923 is assumed to be tenuous as the photo quality.[[footnote]]At this time, debate is ongoing to determine if deploying a camera probe to ███ ██████ is warranted or required, and if such action risks SCP-1923 in the process.[[/footnote]]

At each end of the asteroid, there is a single 'branch' of SCP-1923 that extends an estimated 30m above the canopy. Visually similar to a terrestrial palm tree, these specimens[[footnote]]Due to SCP-1923's canopy, it is currently unknown if these trees are an example of the rest of SCP-1923, or a unique variant of SCP-1923.[[/footnote]] of SCP-1923 are devoid of leaves, except except on the top. These leaves undergo a cycle of growth, maturation, and shedding, the last of which is done //en masse//. The Foundation has hypothesized that this process is procreative in nature. As of ██/██/████, asteroid ███ ██████ remains the only body with which SCP-1923 infests.

**Addendum-1:** On 01/06/20██, the asteroid ███ ██████ was reported to have a slightly reduced albedo and a slight orbital adjustment. Orbital projections show that said asteroid would have been 'behind' the asteroid bearing SCP-1923 during a 'shedding' cycle, there is reason to believe that ███ ██████ may now be infested with SCP-1923. Further study of both asteroids is required.

**Addendum-2:** On 01/10/20██, a new form of SCP-1923 was discovered on the initial asteroid. Located on the equator of ███ ██████, this leaveless sample is partially mobile. The plant terminates in a previously-unseen pod, which alternates between facing the Sun and facing Earth, regardless of orientation. Originally thought to be a coincidence, a form of [DATA EXPUNGED] has been detected from SCP-1923. While it is not known if [EXPUNGED], careful monitoring and analysis of [EXPUNGED] is ongoing.
