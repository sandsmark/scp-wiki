**About:** Creator of the Foundation After Midnight Radio podcast. Producer behind Toad King Studios. Jack of many trades, master of a few. He writes, he draws, he edits, he spends a lot of time writing down ideas that there just isn't time for. Joined the SCP wiki after reading a comment on a creepy gif of SCP-096. Has met one SCP fan IRL, so it is possible the rest of you exist.

[[tab Short Fiction/Jokes]]
Short stories, tale concepts, jokes, memes, and various other written bits too small to be posted by themselves on the wiki. All were posted to social media at one point or another, so saving them all in one place seemed like a good idea.

[[tab Tab 2]]
‚ÄúThe world ended my friend,‚Äù The doctor winced a little as she hobbled up to the tank, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry we didn‚Äôt come to wake you earlier." 

In the murky fluid, a massive form shifted and writhed. Its body constantly deteriorating and growing in the acidic bath.

"We tried to hold out as long as we could, but the bastards were relentless." 

Typing a few commands into the computer, she begins the decontainment process. She swipes the required clearance cards. One hers, the other borrowed from a long dead director. 

"You probably relate." 

The swirling chemicals begin draining from the containment. An alarm rings out as several protocols and procedures are shut off. A massive organism slowly supports itself for the first time in decades. 

"I don‚Äôt care what you did to us. What we did to you." 

"Dis-gusting‚Ä¶‚Äù the reptilian maw spat out the words. 

‚ÄúI know you don‚Äôt care, but I hope you hurt them. Make them regret coming for us." 

"Th-they‚Ä¶ you‚Ä¶ no longer‚Ä¶ con-tain meee‚Ä¶ Humanssss." 

"No, not humans. They came from the stars."

+++++ NIGHTMARES vs ALIENS

Humankind was all but wiped out when an alien fleet came to colonize earth. World governments were destroyed overnight. The Foundation lead the last efforts to fight back, allying with friend and foe. It was not enough. Only the anomalous can save us now.

||~ Page Title ||~ Work ||~ About ||
|| [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-035 SCP-035 - Possessive Mask] || Image Photoshop || //SPOILER//: Wanted to help push this SCP a little with a sneaky --gif--. Put a delay in there so that readers should be just about ready to scroll down the page when it changes. (if read on a desktop browser) Kept it subtle, so not all readers would catch it, as having it change for everyone in the first 5 seconds would be too much. || 
|| [http://www.scp-wiki.net/manna-charitable-foundation-hub Manna Charitable Foundation Hub]|| Logo Design || Worked with [[*user Dr Reach]] during a GOI contest way back when. Used my graphic design skills to craft a logo that we felt captured a charitable organization feel. Really happy people have liked it and used it moving forward. ||
|| [http://www.scp-wiki.net/if-you-are-reading-this If You Are Reading This...]|| Entry || An open collaboration with a lot of heart. Couldn't resist adding in my own entry here. Might have gotten a bit too personal, as DJ Scip is voiced by my real-life brother, but it felt right to write from the heart. ||
|| [http://www.scp-wiki.net/christmas Christmas] ||¬†¬†Entry || Added my own entry about a Christmas gone wrong. One of my first dips into writing on the actual wiki. ||
|| [http://www.scp-wiki.net/univine-s-author-page Univine's Author Page] || Audio Recording || Had my dad, an actual pastor, record a reading of [[*user Univine]]'s [http://www.scp-wiki.net/univine-s-author-page Excerpts Regarding St. Sophia] for the 2016 Christmas exchange. Thought it would be a nice touch for an interesting GOI format. ||
|| [http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-696298 Famous last words in the Foundation universe] || Forum Post || Still proud of this 30+ page long forum post about famous last words within the Foundation. Don't post on there as it's long dead, but it's still a highlight for me that so many people had fun coming up with ones on there. ||
