[[tab About Tab]]
Short stories, tale concepts, jokes, memes, and various other written bits too small to be posted by themselves on the wiki. All were posted to social media at one point or another, so saving them all in one place seemed like a good idea.

[[tab “The world ended my friend,”]]
“The world ended my friend,” The doctor winced a little as she hobbled up to the tank, “I’m sorry we didn’t come to wake you earlier." 

In the murky fluid, a massive form shifted and writhed. Its body constantly deteriorating and growing in the acidic bath.

"We tried to hold out as long as we could, but the bastards were relentless." 

Typing a few commands into the computer, she begins the decontainment process. She swipes the required clearance cards. One hers, the other borrowed from a long-dead director. 

"You probably relate." 

The swirling chemicals begin draining from the containment. An alarm rings out as several protocols and procedures are shut off. A massive organism slowly supports itself for the first time in decades. 

"I don’t care what you did to us. What we did to you." 

"Dis-gusting…” the reptilian maw spat out the words. 

“I know you don’t care, but I hope you hurt them. Make them regret coming for us." 

"Th-they… you… no longer… con-tain meee… Humanssss." 

"No, not humans. They came from the stars."

++++ NIGHTMARES vs ALIENS

Humankind was all but wiped out when an alien fleet came to colonize earth. World governments were destroyed overnight. The Foundation lead the last efforts to fight back, allying with friend and foe. It was not enough. Only the anomalous can save us now.

[[tab I believe there’s a hole in your story]]
**RESEARCHER KIM:** “…and then we left the test chamber.”

**AGENT:** “Unfortunately, Researcher Kim, I believe there’s a hole in your story.”

**RESEARCHER KIM:** “Wha-what? You can check the cameras, I was-”

**AGENT:** “You misunderstand. I believe you. I also believe fictional characters have been escaping from the book you tested.”
[[/tab]]
[[tab Hate Mondays]]
“Who exactly am I speaking to?“ 

"Tee hee, is dat anyway to speak to a gød?" 

The being was a collage of pop culture references in bright black and dark neon colors. Looking at it gave Researcher Darren a headache. 

"We didn’t know there was someone else like-” 

“God-Chan is dead. I killed her after 24 episodes of fighting across 2 seasons. I didn’t even need my final form to do it." 

"That’s..” he fumbled with how to respond to this development. When supreme beings from other dimensions decided to adopt modern mythos it was off-putting. 

“Your comments don’t matter, baka. Like and subscribe, cause I’m your nu gød." 

Thankfully the being didn’t seem to notice him wince at this. A weebo armed with memes now? At least God-Chan had been a more traditional deity to deal with. 

"I’ll be sure to update our higher-ups.” 

“Update your kings, your mods! Don’t at me! New video for followers only!" 

 And with that the self-proclaimed god disappeared, leaving behind a symbol burned into the containment cell floor. The air smelled of sulfur and bubble tea.

"Great! Just what I wanted to start my Monday off with!” Darren shouted to no one in particular as guards rushed by him with fire extinguishers to put out the flames.

[[tab “You want out of here?"]]
She fired another burst into the thing. By how it lurched closer still, she knew none of her shots were doing real damage. 

“You want out of here?" 

It paused. The form seemed to shift back and forth a bit. 

If it was sentient enough, this might just work. 

"You want out of here, you’re not going to find it this way. The main doors lock the second any of the alarms go off." 

It wasn’t a total lie, but it was hard to sound confident when talking to something out of a nightmare. 

"Your best bet is through the vents.” 

“Vvv̡vvv̛v͢v͜v̧e̕ȩee͡ȩeee̵ęen͜ńnntz͝z̀z̨z” 

"Yeah. Up there. They don’t lock down right away. You get there fast enough, that’s your best bet at escaping this place." 

The form collapsed into itself. It swished around. Maybe it was debating this information. 

"Clock is ticking. I’m dead either way. They’re gonna kill everyone in this wing to make sure they don’t let you escape." 

The fluid seemed to shift and agitate before rising up the nearest wall, tearing open the vent at the ceiling. 

She listened to its movements echo down the metal vents. 

Only once the sounds of it were long gone did she take her eyes off the air duct. 

"Fucking a…" 

She collapsed to the tiled floor of the lab and cried until she heard the breach doors begin the unlock sequence. It took long enough she had a few minutes still to herself.

[[tab the third floor of a two-story building]]
Agent McAphee slowly cleared the landing of the third floor of a two-story building. At the top of the stairs was door looked like it had been burned into the wall. A crudely transplanted space where it shouldn’t be.

The heavy hinges groaned as the door opened at her approach. 

“O̴h̵ ̵p̴l̶e̷a̴s̷e̷,̵ ̶w̵o̸n̶'̷t̸ ̶y̷o̴u̵ ̷h̸e̵l̴p̸ ̴m̵e̷?̸ ̸I̷'̶v̴e̸ ̶f̶a̵l̴l̶e̷n̵ ̷a̷n̴d̴ ̷I̶ ̵n̸e̵e̵d̵ ̶h̶e̶l̵p̷.̶" 

The figure on the floor writhed in what could be mistaken for pain. Its form prepared to pounce the second she came within reach. 

"W̶o̶n̵'̴t̸ ̸y̸o̸u̴ ̶h̴e̸l̶p̸ ̷m̵e̷,̴ ̷g̶i̸r̶l̴?̴”

Agent McAphee, unable to hear the audio lure in the entity’s voice through her helmet filter, stood still. Maintaining visual, two flashbangs are unclipped and tossed to the floor between them. 

The creature was only mildly confused for a second. After the blasts, it was extremely confused and severely disoriented. 

Screeching and thrashing, the thing in the room that shouldn’t be was bound and secured by the Mobile Task Force agents who entered in through the windows.

If you want to know how someone rappelled through the third-floor windows on a two-story building, or what happened to that floor after the creature was removed from the room, you’ll have to read the report. If you want the full story, you’ll need to have level 4 clearance.

[[tab “It’s like they say, ‘Hell hath no fury]]
**MTF1:** “It’s like they say, ‘Hell hath no fury like an oculist who sacrificed everything only to find out their god was just some reality-bending punk.’ ”

**MTF2:** “Dude, you need to get out of the Foundation more.”

[[tab Ukelele Orchestra]]
“I don’t give a damn which Agent Ukelele any of you are!” The stout man with the wide brim hat shouted as he slammed his hand on the table.

The man whose face was a spider, then an error screen, then a duck, pointed around the room. “We’re all here cause we earned the title.”

An extremely handsome man nodded, while a man in shadows strummed a ukulele.

“But are any of you bastards really reality benders? Demons? Some of you don’t look like you could take Kondraki and his butterflies.” Said a young girl cleaning a revolver as big as her forearm.

“As he said, we gathered all the real deals together. Any fakes or those too spent to be of any help were left in their realities.” The man with the changing face flipped through a folder of x'ed out files. “A few double agents were given one-way trips to the surface of the moon”

“We’re here because we save the people who work in the shadows from the shadows themselves. We’ve killed gods and angels and punk ass cyborg reality benders. This goes beyond the Foundation, beyond any one reality. Hell, we’re going beyond planet earth here.”

“So agents,” the stout man handed out mission briefs, “this is Operation Last Song.”

“Or Ukelele Orchestra. We’re still working on the title.”

[[tab “First time using D-Class, eh?”]]
“First time using D-Class, eh?”

“Yes, sorry, it’s a little unnerving. Didn’t really hit me until I saw they were real people.”

“You get used to it.”

“Can I ask you how you-”

“Silly names.”

“Excuse me?”

“I give all the D-Class silly names. That’s Biceps. Next to him is Forehead Tat. Behind her is Twitchy. Makes it a lot easier when they die.”

[[tab FOUNDATION 2099]]
FOUNDATION 2099:

In the year 2099, the Foundation fended off a massive reality ending anomaly but it left massive scars felt across the world.

Whole countries were erased from the populous conscious. GOIs were undone or splintered. The Foundation suffered the most.

Several sites are offline or running on backup automation but they will go nuclear if not accessed within a year.

Dr. Bright, now stuck in an 11-year-old girl's body, must travel across the United Republic of America into the territory no one can acknowledge is missing.

Accompanied by a trusty dog sized unkillable reptilian, a golf ball sized stone that moves when you blink, and a doctor turned cat turned catperson, Dr. Bright is gonna need all the help he can get to save what's left of the Foundation.

2099 miles, 15 sites, no transferring bodies, new friends, old enemies, one hell of a roadtrip as a last mission.

[[tab Everyone I knew is dead.]]
Everyone I knew is dead.

You can’t tell me otherwise. I watched them turn. The sound changed them. It hit every device across the globe at once.

Anything that could play audio, that could pick up a signal. They hit each and every single one.

It took a few minutes, maybe a few hours for all those affected to transform. To get the full effect to take over but they’re all gone now. Well, any trace of what made them, well, them.

Only a few of us didn’t hear it. Couldn’t hear it. Still, I’m pretty sure I’m one of the last around. The affected made short work of the non-affected.

May whatever you believe in have mercy on them. Finding themselves suddenly in a crowd of violent, aggressive mind slaves.

I’m sure someone, somewhere in a bunker is having a field day determining the memetic, cognitohazard, whatever it was that jammed the human signal and overwrote whole populations in minutes.

Me? I’m currently riding a secret underground subway system across the continent. We’re lucky whatever hit everyone else rewrote everything in the human mind.

Can you imagine? A massive army that can be hindered because they don’t even remember what the word “PULL” on a door means? Still, enough hammering and the drones can break through or get over just about anything, given time.

Time, it’s about all I have on my side right now. That, and some nutjob who thought that keeping an SCP that can rewrite the world around might come in handy.

I hope I get there in time. The train is so far underground, I think I’m traveling under the ocean in places? Hard to tell.

There are some perks to being one of the humans squirreled away by the Foundation in the event of something like this. They really did try to think of everything.

If they didn’t, then everyone I know is as good as dead and I’m not far behind them.

[[tab GOLIATH UNIT DEPLOYED]]
12:41:58 EST PM: SITE-32-2 DETECTS CONTAINMENT PROCEDURE FAILURE FOR SCP-[REDACTED] 

12:58:03 EST PM: FULL CONTAINMENT FAILURE OF SCP-[REDACTED]. LOCKDOWN INITIATED AT SITE-32-2 

1:28:36 EST PM: SITE SECURITY REQUEST HEAVY BACKUP 

1:36:14 EST PM: GOLIATH UNIT DEPLOYED 

“I had heard about them before but never seen one. It, they, sorry. I wish I knew their name to thank them. I didn’t even catch their number, the one that saved us. A thing was trying to get into the lab we were barricaded in. The Goliath picked it up like it was a kitten.” 

“Man, those Goliaths, they’re heavy as fuck. You hear each footfall even when they’re just walking casually. But when they engage an anomaly? It’s like those videos where a construction crane operator cracks an egg open without breaking the glass cup under it.” 

“It’s against policy to openly share security footage from during a containment breach. I will tell you though, they made quick work of each of the anomalous instances. There’s a certain amount of glee I’ll admit to knowing the things were put down and put down hard.” 

“People ask if they’re anomalies as well. If there’s a person under there or if it’s just a robot. Each Goliath is a person like you and me but put through the toughest training to deal with anomalies the Foundation could dream up. Augmented, sure. But human nonetheless.”

2:39:15 EST PM: CONTAINMENT BREACH NULLED. SITE-32-2 LOCKDOWN LIFTED. SCP-[REDACTED] CONTAINMENT REESTABLISHED.
