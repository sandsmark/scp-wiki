**About:** Creator of the Foundation After Midnight Radio podcast. Producer behind Toad King Studios. Jack of many trades, master of a few. He writes, he draws, he edits, he spends a lot of time writing down ideas that there just isn't time for. Joined the SCP wiki after reading a comment on a creepy gif of SCP-096. Has met one SCP fan IRL, so it is possible the rest of you exist.
