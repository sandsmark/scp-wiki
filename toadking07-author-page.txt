**About:** Creator of the Foundation After Midnight Radio podcast. Producer behind Toad King Studios. Jack of many trades, master of a few. He writes, he draws, he edits, he spends a lot of time writing down ideas that there just isn't time for. Joined the SCP wiki after reading a comment on a creepy gif of SCP-096. Has met one SCP fan IRL, so it is possible the rest of you exist.

+ Works For:
||~ Page Title ||~ Work ||~ About ||
|| [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-035 SCP-035 - Possessive Mask] || Image Photoshop || //SPOILER//: Wanted to help push this SCP a little with a sneaky --gif--. Put a delay in there so that readers should be just about ready to scroll down the page when it changes. (if read on a desktop browser) Kept it subtle, so not all readers would catch it, as having it change for everyone in the first 5 seconds would be too much. || 
|| [http://www.scp-wiki.net/manna-charitable-foundation-hub Manna Charitable Foundation Hub]|| Logo Design || Worked with [[*user Dr Reach]] during a GOI contest way back when. Used my graphic design skills to craft a logo that we felt captured a charitable organization feel. Really happy people have liked it and used it moving forward. ||
|| [http://www.scp-wiki.net/if-you-are-reading-this If You Are Reading This...]|| Entry || An open collaboration with a lot of heart. Couldn't resist adding in my own entry here. Might have gotten a bit too personal, as DJ Scip is voiced by my real-life brother, but it felt right to write from the heart. ||
|| [http://www.scp-wiki.net/christmas Christmas] ||¬†¬†Entry || Added my own entry about a Christmas gone wrong. One of my first dips into writing on the actual wiki. ||
|| [http://www.scp-wiki.net/univine-s-author-page Univine's Author Page] || Audio Recording || Had my dad, an actual pastor, record a reading of [[*user Univine]]'s [http://www.scp-wiki.net/univine-s-author-page Excerpts Regarding St. Sophia] for the 2016 Christmas exchange. Thought it would be a nice touch for an interesting GOI format. ||
|| [http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-696298 Famous last words in the Foundation universe] || Forum Post || Still proud of this 30+ page long forum post about famous last words within the Foundation. Don't post on there as it's long dead, but it's still a highlight for me that so many people had fun coming up with ones on there. ||
