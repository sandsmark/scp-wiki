The walls were cream colored. The floors were a checkboard mixture of pale green and gray. A man and a doctor stood in the darkness of the corridor.

The doctor chuckled softly. "You have a strange sense of humor, Mr. Carter."

Mr. Carter and the doctor stood outside of a patient's room. The smell of disinfectants and the sounds of beeping equipment were the only interruptions as Mr. Carter composed himself.

"I'm not sure I see the joke."

"You take me to this house of death. You parade me down halls teeming with the pestilence. Then you bring me to the room of the only man here who is free from its influence."

Mr. Carter cleared his throat and chuckled himself. "Be that as it may, our client has asked us to ensure the man in that room is cured. If you must, consider him one of your test subjects."

"My expertise is in curing the disease, not death."

Mr. Carter shifted in place uncomfortably. "When you and [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-035 your friend] escaped the Foundation, he agreed that you would perform certain services for us in exchange for our resources and protection. If that deal is no longer in place..."

The words hung on the air for several seconds.

"Of course." The doctor reached for the doorknob. "I will need some time alone then."

Mr. Carter nodded along. "Excellent. If you need anything, my men will be outside."

The doctor was halfway into the room as Mr. Carter finished speaking.

The room was claustrophobic and dark. A frail man lay in a bed against the far wall. Alongside the bed was a small table with a dim lamp and a chair. The doctor walked over to the bed and placed a gloved hand over the patient's forehead. The man startled awake.

"Who's there?" The man asked with blank eyes.

"I am your doctor."

"Ah. Sorry." The patient waved his hand weakly. "You don't sound like my doctor."

"He was unable to come. He asked me to check in on you. You do not have much time I think."

"No. I'm very sick."

"You are not sick. You are merely dying."

The long beeps of the heart rate monitor filled the silence.

"Where is your family?"

The man let out a small sigh.

The doctor pulled the chair out and sat down next to the bed.

"The next few hours are going to be very difficult. There is little I can do to alleviate the pain. Would you like me to stay?"

The man sniffled slightly and nodded his head. The doctor took the man's hand and sat with him in silence.
