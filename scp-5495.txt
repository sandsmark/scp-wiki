**Special Containment Procedures:** All property within a 300-meter radius of the center of the anomaly are currently under Foundation control. A facility has been constructed around the anomaly under the guise of a chemical manufacturing plant. Security personnel are to be posted outside each entrance of this facility and the building is to be placed under constant video surveillance.

As the anomaly expands, the area and height of the building may be extended as needed. If and when the anomaly reaches within 5 meters of the wall facing the street, construction of an alternative route around the facility is authorized. This process may be repeated until either the anomaly is neutralized or until containment is no longer necessary or possible.

Neutralization of the anomaly is of priority, but estimates place failure of feasible containment procedures occurring at approximately 4:56 PM, February 19th, 2065. As such, Foundation assets have been allocated to concerns deemed more pressing.

Current operations regarding SCP-5495 reside under control of Researcher Dr. Ace Gaoler.

**Description:** SCP-5495 is a spatial and temporal anomaly centered within what used to be the living room of a house in Tombstone, Arizona. To observers outside of the anomaly, it appears as a static cloud of debris caused by an explosion. In reality, the “surface” of the explosion is constantly expanding from the center at a nearly imperceptible rate (currently approximately 1.03 m/year based on best estimates). The expansion does not appear to spread downwards, but otherwise occurs in equal rates in all directions. It is anchored at what is believed to be the origin point of the explosion.

Objects which pass through the surface of the explosion --never leave its area-- may pass through the anomaly after an elongated period of time (see Addendum A). A majority of the house (around 200 meters from the center) has already been incorporated into the anomaly. The rest of the house has been removed in order to prevent further incorporation of non-anomalous material.

Significant tests conducted upon SCP-5495 can be found in Addendum A.

**History:** SCP-5495 was first observed on April 16th, 1922. Various residents of Tombstone, Arizona reported a noise characteristic of an explosion originating from the household of J███ and M███ Anderson. J███ was a retired copper miner, so it was first assumed he had accidentally set off explosive charges he may have kept. Police of the area arrived at the household to find the anomaly already having incorporated around 100 meters of the house, with neither of the Andersons ever being found. Foundation personnel were alerted to its existence after numerous police officers entered the radius of the anomaly and did not return, drawing attention of local newspapers. The anomaly was shortly thereafter contained, current containment procedures were created, and amnestics were distributed to the local population.

Researcher Dr. B███ was assigned as head of current operations regarding SCP-5495 until his death in 1986, at which point operations were passed from various researchers until 2005, when Dr. Gaoler was appointed.

The expansion of the anomaly was not discovered until two years into its containment. Since then, SCP-5495 has grown well past the boundaries of a non-anomalous mining charge explosion. It has shown no signs of any change in its expansion rate, and no known methods have resulted in significant change. This indicates that the anomaly will continue to expand, perhaps even indefinitely, if no countermeasures are enacted.

Only significant testing logs have been included. For a full list of testing logs, please view Document 5495-T1.

> **__Log 1__**
> **Date:** 04-22-1922
> **Procedure:** Initial test of SCP-5495 following classification. Dr. B███ tossed several items into the area of the anomaly’s effect from various angles, including: a pen, a baseball, a ham sandwich, and a fire-proof pocket watch. He also instructs a security personnel to fire a sidearm once into the anomaly.
> **Results:** After being thrown into the anomaly, the items froze in place for several minutes before disappearing. Some of the items were seen at different points inside of the anomalous area, appearing either static or moving infinitesimally slowly. --None of the objects exited the anomaly.-- (See Log 144)
> **Research Notes:** //Well, I guess I won’t be having lunch today. - Dr. B███//

> **__Log 15__**
> **Date:** 10-15-1925
> **Procedure:** First test following documentation of expanding effect. Dr. B███ instructed a D-Class personnel to insert his hand into the area of the anomaly and describe what they felt. Events were transcribed by a lower-level assistant and are presented below.
> **<Begin Transcription>**
> **B███:** Okay, D-022213, if you could please put your hand into that cloud of debris for me, and keep it inside for as long as you can.
> **D-022213:** Er, alright, I guess. Is this some sort of weird illusion? How is this set up?
> **B████:** Please, follow instructions and do not ask questions. Do as you are told and everything should be fine.
> [D-022213 sighs and inserts his hand. His face turns white and he falls back. His arm is severed and appears briefly in the spot where it had been inserted before disappearing. From where his arm was attached to his body, blood pools onto the ground. He is immediately escorted out of the building by security personnel.]
> **B███:** Yep, I expected as much.
> **<End of Transcription>**
> **Research Notes:** //I don’t think there’s much we can do right now. The explosion’s not gonna get too out of hand for another hundred-and-forty-something years they tell me, so we should have enough time to figure something out by then. Regardless, this should be reclassified and given some priority. -Dr. B███//

No significant testing occurred between 10-15-1925 and 06-22-2005

> **__Log 144__**
> **Date:** 06-22-2005
> **Procedure:** First test conducted after Dr. Gaoler was appointed head of operations. Originally standard protocol test similar to Log 1, but a significant event occurred during testing. Video transcription is below.
> **<Begin Transcription>**
> [Dr. Gaoler tosses a small piece of metal into the anomaly. It behaves as expected. Shortly after, while taking notes, Gaoler is struck in the stomach by a flying pen. He exclaims and lurches over in pain. He approaches the camera and begins speaking.]
> **Gaoler:** I don’t know what just happened, but, oh - 
> [Gaoler runs off-screen for a moment and returns holding the pen. He looks bewildered.]
> **Gaoler:** This pen, it’s what just hit me. It came out of 5495, I think, and it’s still warm, and - holy shit. This, this is B███’s pen. It has his fucking name on it, a little scorched, but it’s fucking there! Look.
> [Gaoler holds the pen to the camera, and on it B███’s name is barely legible amidst burn marks.]
> **Gaoler:**  I, I think I need to reassess what’s going on here. We’ve only got 60 years now and it’s probably worth looking into every angle to stop - 
> [Gaoler is interrupted as something hits him in the back of the leg. He exclaims in pain again and falls to the floor just below screen. Security personnel rush in to help, but before he is taken away Gaoler manages to face the camera again.]
> **Gaoler:** I think the security from 19-fucking-22 just shot me!
> [Shortly after Gaoler is escorted out of the room, a baseball manifests mid-air, hits against a wall, and bounces back into the anomaly. A silver pocket watch also falls from above.]
> **<End of Transcription>**
> **Research Notes:** //There’s definitely a lot to unpack here. Where did the items go, and why did they come back? Through what mechanism are they returning? We may finally have a breakthrough. - Dr. Gaoler//

> **__Log 145__**
> **Date:** 06-25-2005
> **Procedure:** Dr. Gaoler inserts an explosive-resistant camera equipped with real-time transmission and an anomalously extended battery life into SCP-5495's area of effect. 
> **Results:** After the camera was inserted, transmission lasted slightly longer than 4 minutes before stopping completely. The video received was incredibly sped up compared to its previous transmissions. A transcription of the video received (when slowed to a watchable timescale) is below.
> **<Begin Transcription>**
> **Gaoler:** Let's see if this works, little buddy.
> [The camera falls to the ground, roughly 5 feet below where it was inserted. As it falls, the cloud of debris quickly encompasses the camera's field of view and the explosion appears to continue as it would in real-time. After several minutes (fractions of a second in the actual transmission), the explosion and debris cloud have completely dissipated. The camera lies on orange soil and faces the direction of what would be the road outside of the anomaly, but there are no signs of a road in sight of the camera. In the very far distance, the cloud of debris continues expanding rapidly before it extends below the horizon. Of note is that the sky appears to be tinted red-gray. The recording continues uneventfully for 3 hours before the camera enters power-saving mode, ceasing transmission until a significant change occurs. After 4 minutes would have passed outside of the anomaly's area of effect, the camera restarts. It is still lying in open desert, seemingly unmoved. A voice can be heard, which has been determined to match that of Dr. Gaoler, though much rougher in tone.]
> **Gaoler(?):** [Laughs] I found it after all this time!
> [Gaoler(?) enters the field of view of the camera and picks it up. The face confirms that the voice belonged to a version of Gaoler, though this one looks much older, with scarring across the face and graying hair. He is also wearing heavy survival gear and a very large hitchhiker's backpack. Gaoler smiles when he picks up the camera before noticing it's on very low power mode and frowning.]
> **Gaoler(?):** Fuck. Fuck! I-I was too late! I'll always be too fucking late! [He sighs.] God help you all. You need to stop SCP-549-
> [Gaoler(?) is cut off as the video transmission ends due to the battery of the camera finally dying.]
> **<End of Transcription>**
> **Researcher Notes:** //To say this was unsettling would be an extreme understatement. Action MUST be taken to prevent the further expansion of SCP-5495. Whatever we saw cannot be allowed to pass. I'm going to make an appeal to higher personnel. We NEED to reallocate our resources. Why the fuck is this still Euclid? - Dr Gaoler//

[[collapsible show="+ Addendum 5495-B - Previous Appeals" hide="- Close Appeals"]]

Since containment, SCP-5495 has been the subject of many appeals. Listed below are significant appeals made to the O-5 council. To view all of such attempts, please view Document 5495-T2.

> **__Appeal 5495-1__**
> **Filed by:** Dr. B████
> **Date filed:** 10-16-1925
> **Subject:** Reclassification
> **Content:** If it would please the O-5 council, I think it would probably be appropriate if we reclassified SCP-5495 as Keter. The fact that it's expanding means it serves a great risk not only in protecting the "veil" but in protecting the world at large, possibly the universe if it continues unchecked for long enough. Please consider this a formal request.
> **Response: Denied.** Anomaly is expanding at a rate too slow to be considered dangerous to the world at large.

> **__Appeal 5495-12__**
> **Filed by:** Dr. B████
> **Date filed:** 10-27-1938
> **Subject:** Reclassification
> **Content:** It's still getting bigger, guys. Nothing that enters ever comes out. For fuck's sake, this is an obvious threat. Keter.
> **Response: Denied.** The anomaly still exists within an only 113.5 meter radius and is still easily containable. Use the resources allocated to you to prevent the failure of its containment.

> **__Appeal 5495-57__**
> **Filed by:** Dr. Q███████ [Then-appointed head researcher of SCP-5495]
> **Date filed:** 05-17-1967
> **Subject:** Reclassification
> **Content:** Formal request of item to be reclassified to Keter and for allocation of more resources to prevent a possible XK-Class End-of-the-World Scenario. Expansion of anomaly remains unhindered. No sign of stopping. Nothing returns.
> **Response: Denied.** Anomaly is still within acceptable limits before being classified Keter. Please take the time to reassess how you are using your current resources, they should be more than enough.

> **__Appeal 5495-134__**
> **Filed by:** Dr. T█████ [Then-appointed head researcher of SCP-5495]
> **Date filed:** 12-23-1999
> **Subject:** Reclassification
> **Content:** It's almost the new millennium and this thing still sin't [sic] fucking Keter? I'm supposed to be on Christmas leave not filing god damn appeals. Get your heads out of your asses and fucking do something.
> **Response: Denied.** Anomaly is still within acceptable parameters. You will refrain from such an unprofessional attitude or further appeals will be ignored and your employment will be reconsidered. Watch your tone.

> **__Appeal 5495-233__**
> **Filed by:** Dr. Ace Gaoler
> **Date filed:** 04-11-2015
> **Subject:** Reclassification
> **Content:** The anomaly's area of effect is still getting larger. It shows no sign of stopping or even slowing down any time soon. This is almost my 100th appeal since I began working with SCP-5495, please, PLEASE listen. This is a very dangerous anomaly that will almost CERTAINLY cause an XK-Class event if we don't do anything. I formally request reclassification of the object from Euclid to Keter, as well as of its Disruption class to Amida and its Risk class to Critical. We only have 50 more years of this.
> **Response: Denied.** The Anomaly is still within acceptable parameters. Dr. Gaoler, we acknowledge how the results of 2005's video transmission must have affected you personally. But many of our precognitive anomalies predict us outlasting this supposed "50 years," and many predict we won't even make it that far. A lot of them have been wrong. You have no way of knowing whether this anomaly will cease its expansion within 50 years. We will grant you reclassification of its Disruption and Risk classes from Vlam and Warning to Ekhi and Danger, respectively, as the use of this new classification system is still in its early stages. We will not, however, reclassify it from Euclid to Keter, and we have ascertained that the current resources allotted to you should be more than enough. We hope the next appeal we receive on this topic is to reclassify it from "Euclid" to "Neutralized."

> **__Appeal 5495-243__**
> **Filed by:** Dr. Ace Gaoler
> **Date filed:** 02-19-2020
> **Subject:** Reclassification
> **Content:** 45 years until it all hits the fan. I really hope you will reconsider. It may already be too late.
> **Response: Pending.**
