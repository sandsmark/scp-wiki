[[tab Profile]]

[[include component:image-block
    name=crab.jpg|
    caption=Image expunged for dysphoria reasons, here's a good boi instead. <3
]]

**Name:** [[*user Nagiros]]

**PoI Designation:** PoI-Cr@b-091

**Aliases:** Nagi, Crabbo, Queen of the Crustaceans, Tax Evasion

**Gender:** Female

**Age:** 17

**Country of Origin:** America

**Threat Type:** Creation of anomalous items and events, development of anomalies with various other Persons of Interest.

**Bases of Operation:**

||||~ SCP Sandbox||[http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/nagiros Click for some bad ideas and bad execution.]||
||||~ The Wanderers' Library||[http://wanderers-sandbox.wikidot.com/nagiros Reports pending!]||
||||~ The Wayward Society||[http://wayward.wikidot.com/aberrationsandbox:nagiros-aberrations Spooky stuff in the woods.]||

**Policy for Engagement:** PoI-Cr@b-091 is currently open to DMs on Wikidot. Feel free to ask for help developing a tale or anomaly, and I'll get back as soon as I can!

**Profile:** PoI-Cr@b-091 came to the attention of the Foundation after being implicated in the creation of the now-infamous "big bad which done killed slightly less big bad and wants kill you too". The fight between the BBWDKSLBBAWKYT and the slightly less big bad was almost unanimously described by Foundation personnel as "the coolest shit we've seen all year", but Dr. Rittons continues to object, saying, "What the hell? It was just some psychic kid who started crying and then the other guy exploded."[[footnote]] The BBWDKSLBBAWKYT has since been accidentally neutralized due to an undiscovered peanut allergy. [[/footnote]]

Analysis of PoI-Cr@b-091's social media accounts after the initial containment of the BBWDKSLBBAWKYT revealed a string messages using subversions of popular literary phrases such as "What hath the cruel gods wrought?" and "Have they not heard in the hill countries that Geshtua is dead?" PoI-Cr@b-091 is not known to be religious in any sense and these comments are interpreted as her attempting to make her articles cooler without having any original ideas.

PoI-Cr@b-091's status as a Person of Interest was withheld until she was implicated in the creation of three more anomalous entities and events, namely, "[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4051 teenager who is sad]", "[http://www.scp-wiki.net/the-beast-beneath-the-library teenager who is crazy]", and "[http://www.scp-wiki.net/he-who-screws-with-reality teenager who is angry]". There are currently no identified trends in PoI-Cr@b-091's creations which could be used to predict future anomalies.

PoI-Cr@b-091 is believed to still be enrolled in high school and working to enter studies related to government, specializing in political science and communications. She oftentimes attempts to present herself as her persona, "a blood witch who does street art and doesn't give a shit", but has been described as the exact opposite by most of her peers. She's also excited to help expand her writing capabilities with her works on and off the site.

Thanks a ton for reading! Make sure the check out my stuff in the other tab.

[[tab Recommended SCPs and Tales]]

Here you'll fine some articles and tales that I've personally really enjoyed. Keep in mind, this isn't a list designed to introduce new community members! Shoutout to [[*user Shaggydredlocks]] for putting together the awesome [[[User-Curated Lists]]], which functions far better in that regard.

That being said, if you have an article that you think deserves to be on this list, PM me! I'd love to read it.

**Other Important Note:** If you see an item on this list that is attributed to the wrong author because the Discord bot I used screwed up, please contact me about it and I'll correct it as soon as possible.
