> Welcome to Site-17. We are the means to every end; Keter and Safe alike find themselves here eventually. There is magic coursing through the halls, automatons feasting in the canteen, and reality-benders sleeping under lock and key. There is always the slowly-beating thrum of anticipation, always the knowledge of something bigger, always the end just out of reach. None of us understand what we're containing, and God knows our superiors won't say a word.
>
> So keep your head down, and your nose to the grindstone. You don't have to like what we do here; you just have to do it. If you start having dreams, consult a psychiatrist. If you start feeling ill, look past the blood. If you start losing your memories, don't bother. That's just how it is in this place.

[[<]]
The Site-17 Deepwell Catalog is a series of tales and SCPs which are written to be enjoyable in isolation, but are constructing a complex narrative beneath the surface about power structures, secrecy, and the faults of the Foundation. The core "narrative" articles are being authored by [[*user Nagiros]].

++++* Is this a series or a canon?
It's officially a series that you can participate in, pending canon status. At present, one more author needs to submit a successful entry.

++++* Writers' Guide
Writing for Site-17 can be as simple as referencing a character in your tale or article. Note that simply referencing Site-17 as a facility is not enough, as Site-17 has been a fairly prevalent installation in wiki history for a while now.

The ideal submission deals with Ethics Committee interactions, humanoid anomalies, and/or essophysics while being thematically concerned with secrecy, truth, and/or the sacrifices made to maintain the Veil. If you just want to write an article with a few characters you like, though, have at it!

If you want to do something more major with an established character, I'd appreciate being contacted first. I promise I won't impose my visions of the characters too much! I just need to check over that it doesn't conflict with extant or future installations in the core articles.

In either case, feel free to add it to the [/site-17#toc0 Site-17 Deepwell Catalog section] when it's posted!

[[# Apollon]]
++ Apollyon
**Role:** Uncontained Essophysical Anomaly
**Bio:** Embodying anomalous phenomena, Apollyon was unintentionally summoned by the Foundation's Veil Protocol and solely desires to upend normalcy — rendering reality itself anomalous. Initial containment efforts proved incapable of stopping its titanic strength and willpower, and it briefly entered the local timeline before dispersing into another. It's re-entry into our timeline would constitute a ΔK-Class ("Immolated Masquerade") Scenario.

[[# Graham]]
++ Dr. Thomas Graham
**Role:** Director of Site-17
**Bio:** Thomas Graham was promoted to Site Director in 2011 after Dr. Weathers became O5-4. Ruthless and determined, Graham has demonstrated a willingness to work well outside the permissions of the Ethics Committee to help the Foundation — however it is that he defines "help", that is. Given immense power through Site-17's Automated Passive Amnestization System, he runs the facility with an iron fist and an eye locked on a brighter future for humanity.

[[# Rainer]]
++ Rainer Miller
**Role:** Contained Anomalous Humanoid
**Bio:** Rainer is capable of producing small items from extradimensional portals and was contained by the Foundation in 2012 as SCP-4051. The unethical testing he underwent prompted numerous characters to take action against Dr. Graham, although Rainer himself would prefer to live a quiet life helping the world in his own small ways.

The permanent containment area of SCP-4260. It remains minimally staffed and is located two kilometers beneath Hong Kong.
* **[[[SCP-4260]]]** - //The Subdirective//

++* Scattered Realm
A series of extradimensional locations accessible to anomalous humanoids via the door of former Humanoid Containment Chamber #λ045. It was created by Samuel Veras to reanimate and protect four contained humanoids killed in experiments by Graham, although Samuel self-terminated during the Realm's creation.

++* Site-17
A major Foundation facility designed to contain a large variety of anomalous items. Located in the northern United States.
* **[/site-17#toc0 Scroll up?]**

++* Site-76
A Foundation Research and Development site which contained SCP-4260, in addition to developing Strayer Density Matrices.
* **[[[SCP-4260]]]** - //The Subdirective//

++* Wanderers' Exile
A dungeon-esque location beneath the Wanderers' Library populated by entities which pose an irrevocable threat to knowledge itself. Individuals which cannot be simply barred from the library are sent here, and are presumably never released.

[[tab The World]]

Here are some unique bits of [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ePWNmLP0Z0 the world] of the SCP Foundation introduced through Site-17.

+++* Essophysics
Essophysics is the study of entities which exert a passive and universal effect on baseline reality. These entities generally exist in a state of omnipresence, their physical forms spread so thin they are practically non-physical. It is presently assumed that reality would be radically altered following their destruction or removal from the timeline.

[[collapsible show="+ Known Essophysical Entities"]]
||~ Name ||~ Essophysical Embodiment ||~ Articles ||
|| Apollyon || Anomalous phenomena. || [[[APAS | Automated Passive Amnestization System Ver. 17.09]]] ||
|| Death, Ethan Horowitz || Universal decay of living organisms and societal structures, entropy. || [[[SCP-4260]]] ||
[[/collapsible]]

+++* K-Class Scenarios
||~ Title ||~ Definition ||~ Articles ||
|| χK-Class ("Crowning-of-Death") Scenario || The inadvertent containment breach of SCP-4260, resulting in universal supremacy of Death and the probability of life's continuation becoming approximately zero. || [[[SCP-4260]]] ||

+++* AMEC and DRO
The Antimemetic Entities Catalog (AMEC) database operates as a classified twin to the standard SCiPNET database, using specialized memetic inoculation to bypass the antimemetic effects of certain anomalous objects. These objects were given an Item Number of DRO-####, standing for Documentation-Resistant Object.

[[div style="display: inline-block; border-radius: 10px; border:solid 2px red; float:top; width:96.5%; padding:10px"]]
* **[/apas/offset/6 DRO-0001]** - Apollyon
* **[/apas/offset/5 DRO-0002]** - Site-17 Seismic Disturbance
* **[/apas/offset/5 DRO-0045]** - Asset.0001.DRO ("Tonya Skyler")
* **[/apas/offset/5 DRO-0355]** - Amorphous Leather Masses
* **[/apas/offset/5 DRO-0678]** - A Living Letter
[[/div]]

If people start taking a liking to this idea, I may make it its own hub.

+++* Esoteric Amnestics
* **Class-S ("Slow Burn") -** Used in situations where operatives without sufficient clearance require knowledge of classified materials for a period of time, and administration of an amnestic after such a period may not be possible. Summarily erases all memories formed between administration and activation of the amnestic.
* **Class-R ("Remote Repression") -** Used when subjects require amnestic application but the excised memories will be of value to the Foundation at a later date. Takes the physical form of a microchip implanted in the neck and acts as a standard amnestic until it is remotely deactivated, allowing the subject to recall the excised memories.

+++* Semi-Physical Entities
* **Aleph-Order:** Designates an entity which is both non-physical and capable of interacting with the physical world while possessing the ability to deconstruct physical objects.
* **Hazma-Order:** Designates an entity which is non-physical and capable of interacting with the physical world via simple pushing and pulling forces.
