title:A Poem for the Mekhanites
//Our hands blaze with glory
Marching ever forward
Our sabatons most gory
Marching to our death//

//Once broken now united
Marching ever forward
In battle undefeated
Marching to our death//

//East further past Scythia
Marching ever forward
Facing beast and Daeva
Marching to our death//

//Our joints slowly turn to rust
Marching ever forward
Our bones are ground into dust
Marching to our death//

//With spear and faith we fight
Marching ever forward
For MEKHANE we show them the light
Marching to our death//

//Over the Caspian and Mashriq
Marching ever forward
Making the fleshbound shriek
Marching to our death//

//Fighting Sarkic fear and Daevite hate
We marched ever forward
We set the trap, they took our bait
Like MEKHANE before us we marched to our death//

//Adytum is shattered
Antikythera battered
Broken once, broken again
United in life, united in death//
