"So, I don't think this is -- ah, well, given your [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3143 recent performance] -- I just don't think it's working out." 

Mr. Tuttle hated conversations like these. They always left him so flustered and uncomfortable. //Someone ought to invent a way of firing people without me having to talk to them//, he thought to himself as he twaddled with his tie. "So, that's it, then. Uh, sorry. I'll need your security card, and we'll have to see you out."

"This is literally the only purpose for which you exist," the deeply unpleasant man on the other side of Mr. Tuttle's desk replied. 

"Pardon?" The fellow wasn't moving to hand over his security card. Pity, that; Mr. Tuttle reached for the intercom that would summon the [http://www.scp-wiki.net/operation-overmeta Pataphysics Department]'s extremely burly security team. //They could just automate it, couldn't they? Maybe with a robot. Give the robot a slot people could drop their security cards into. And maybe a taser, just in case.//

"You're just here to fire me, you insipid dolt. That's why they created you. If they could automate this, they wouldn't have bothered." Dr. Thaum was the very sort of man who made Mr. Tuttle's job such a chore. English Literature Professors really were the worst. 

"Right, then." Mr. Tuttle pressed down on the button. "Marvin? I think I might need you and --"

"Also? It's twiddled. Not 'twaddled'. //Also// also? You can't fire me." Dr. Thaum rose from his chair, throwing his security card down on Mr. Tuttle's desk. "I quit." 

"--and, oh. Oh, nevermind." Mr. Tuttle was almost disappointed. He had been looking forward to seeing Dr. Thaum squirming a bit on the floor while getting tasered. "Alright, then. We greatly appreciate your years of service, and wish you the best of luck in the [http://tvtropes.org/ private] [https://www.fanfiction.net/ sector] --"

"Enough." Dr. Thaum's voice was flat and hard, rising to a
