**Item #:** SCP-1040-J

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Plan 1040-Omega is to be implemented as soon as possible by way of Foundation front //Society of Concerned Parents.// After implementation, it is to remain in effect perpetually.

**Description:** SCP-1040-J is an effect, first documented in 1998,[[footnote]]Derekson, D., //An Insidious Contagion,// Proc. SCP Fndn. 1998, 14(5), 65-67[[/footnote]] that has spread in scope from the early 20th Century onwards to now affect the vast majority of adult humans in the United States.

Subjects under the influence of SCP-1040-J are beholden to a complex internal logic that, to this date, has defied all attempts at analysis. They will repeatedly display behavior harmful to themselves and others, the scope and severity of which constitutes a Keter-level threat. Left unchecked, SCP-1040-J has the potential to cause an AK-class end-of-civilization scenario.

Further characterization of SCP-1040-J is ongoing.

__**Incident 1040-J-264**__
**Vehicle:** 1997 Dodge Grand Caravan
**Driver:** Caucasian female, circa 75yo
**Description:** Subject 264 was observed to repeatedly attempt to move into highway traffic at circa 5-10mph below the average speed of the prevailing traffic flow, almost striking Foundation researcher Dr. D. D███████'s vehicle.

__**Incident 1040-J-030**__ 
**Vehicle:** 2012 Dodge Ram
**Driver:** African-American female, est. 25yo
**Description:** Subject 030 was observed applying cosmetic products to her face at a stop light; when the light changed, Subject 030 suddenly accelerated, narrowly missing the vehicle of Foundation researcher Dr. D. D███████.

__**Incident 1040-J-1054**__ 
**Vehicle:** 2007 Ford Mustang GT
**Driver:** Asian male, est. 40yo
**Description:** Subject 1054 was observed to abruptly pull into the right lane of Interstate ██ north of ██████ and immediately decelerate for no discernible reason. Foundation researcher Dr. D. D███████, who was previously maintaining a sensible two-meter following distance, was forced to initiate emergency maneuvers. 

__**Incident 1040-J-667**__
**Vehicle:** 2009 Ford Escape
**Driver:** Caucasian female, est. 30yo
**Description:** Subject 667 remained stopped for approx. 3 sec too long at a Stop sign when prevailing conditions clearly allowed the subject to proceed, leading another vehicle[[footnote]]Driven by Foundation researcher Dr. D. D███████[[/footnote]], coming up behind, to collide with Vehicle-667's rear bumper.

__**Incident 1040-J-658**__
**Vehicle:** 2006 Honda Civic
**Driver:** Foundation researcher Dr. A. Estevez
**Description:** On ██/██/████, Foundation researcher Dr. D. D███████'s vehicle was deliberately struck by that of Foundation researcher Dr. A. Estevez. Displaying typical SCP-1040-J-influenced behavior, Dr. Estevez suggested that the reason for the collision was in fact Dr. D███████ looking at text messages on his cellular phone while driving through the Site-██ parking lot. However, evidence provided by leading experts on SCP-1040-J[[footnote]]See Citation 1 above.[[/footnote]] suggests that the probability of such a sequence of events approaches zero.
