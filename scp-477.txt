**Item #:** SCP-XXX

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-XXX is enclosed in a climate-controlled structure designated Site-44. It is constructed exclusively of metal and wood, with no use of stone or concrete. Outwardly it appears to be the machinery storage warehouse for a defunct quarry, but it contains numerous labs dedicated to the study and containment of SCP-XXX. No sedimentary stone or concrete items may be removed from the containment complex unless they are first crushed into sand.

Incidences of SCP-XXX inhabitants appearing outside Site-44 must be appropriated immediately and returned to the complex, or disposed of by complete pulverization of their host substrate.

**Description:** SCP-XXX is a thin layer of Cambrian shale extending approximately 2 square km across the surface of a mesa in ██████, Mongolia. Within the stone is a wealth of pristinely preserved aquatic fossils. These fossils are exemplary both in their diversity and in the fact that they are capable of motion and a facsimile of life, “swimming” through rock as though it were the ocean they thrived in 520 million years ago.

The fossils are able to move through all tested types of sedimentary stone without apparent resistance. This constitutes the main danger to successful containment, as an animate fossil which escaped into another geological formation would be extremely difficult to recover (and might engage in runaway reproduction; see incident XXX-01). They are incapable of leaving their stone habitat to move through liquid or gaseous environments, nor can they pass through soil, sand, clay, or other porous substrates. They also seem incapable of passing through minerals that have been generated by processes other than sedimentation, including igneous and metamorphic rock. The geological layer directly beneath SCP-XXX consists of granite and quartzite, which forms a natural barrier to the inhabitants of SCP-XXX. 

During the construction of Site-44, the fossils were discovered to be capable of moving through and inhabiting hardened concrete. Construction and containment procedures have been modified accordingly, and all infested concrete samples destroyed.

Almost 900 species of fossil have been catalogued in SCP-XXX so far, many unknown to mainstream science. Predators, prey organisms, and vegetation are all represented, and interact with each other in a manner consistent with a functioning ecosystem. Despite their lack of soft body parts or any biochemistry that could conceivably support life, residents of SCP-XXX move, eat, and reproduce as though they were alive. 

Foundation researchers have carefully exposed the entire surface of SCP-XXX to facilitate observation and research into its nature. It has recently been proposed that the creatures within are not fossils as they appear, but rather organisms that adapted to life in solid rock hundreds of millions of years ago and remained isolated in the shale ever since.

**Incident XXX-01:** A large fragment of SCP-XXX containing several animate fossils was somehow obtained by the ███████████ Museum of Natural History and put on display. It was placed in contact with the museum’s concrete western wall, and one or more organisms escaped and multiplied. By the time Foundation personnel arrived, thousands of the creatures had infested the building. The old wing of the museum was dismantled and ground into powder as part of a new renovation project announced by the museum’s board of directors.
