title:SCP-494-ARC
**Item #:** SCP-494 

**Object Class:** Safe/Euclid 

**Special Containment Procedures:** Although object is immobile and emits no radiation, full-body HAZMAT suits must be worn by personnel attempting to remove it from its holding facility. Object must be stored in a 0.1 m x 0.1 m x 0.1 m glass container with a removable top, and a piece of specially inscribed paper of 10 cm x 25 cm is to be put on the top part of the container to seal the effects of the object. 

**Description:** Object is a 7.6 cm-long oblong torus which will appear to be suspended in some sort of unknown blue-green liquid or gel (designated SCP 494-A). The viscosity of the liquid will change drastically without notice. The torus itself is made of limestone, and is dyed with ochre to form crude line patterns. The object would appear as to float in mid-air 
in defiance of the laws of gravity. From time to time the ochre dye will glow, though what caused this change is unknown. At the same time, the liquid will begin to gel and form complex ripple-like patterns on its surface. Some of our scientists believe this object to be a device to communicate with another plane of reality, but the hypothesis cannot be proved in any way. It has, to date, caused a number of anomalies to happen while it is stored in its container. For more info on these anomalies, see Addendum 494-A below.

The object itself was recovered by agents in Samoa when a report of an anomalous cavern was found. The archeological team which were investigating the incident at the time disappeared right in front of an agent while she was trailing them into the cave. Eventually, the object was sighted by the agent, and fully suited SCP personnel soon retrieved 
the object. The cave entrance was caved in to prevent further exploration by civilians. 

**Addendum 494-A:** Anomalies 

During its time in storage, the monitors captured some of these anomalies: 

- In  ██ / ██ / ████, the ochre dye glows blue instead of red. While it was glowing, the walls of its container were pouring SCP-494-A, until the whole container is filled to the brim. It then began the usual rippling pattern behavior. 

- At random times, with an interval average of a month, a ghostly blue- tinted hologram or projection appeared outside the container. The hologram is very blurred and in the shape of a humanoid-looking figure, wearing bangles, beads, frills, and what looked like shells, and emitted no sound. It usually dissipates after fifteen minutes of roaming near the object, as if it were guarding the object. 

- In  ██ / ██ / ████, a hovering blue light and a hovering red light appeared while three level 1 staffs were transporting it to the laboratory for analysis (for analysis result consult Addendum 494-B). One staff reported hearing the sound of ocean waves and started dropping on his knees, another cried and wailed in an unknown language and deep sadness, while the third cried out tears of SCP-494-A. The latter was the one who was still handling the object. The whole incident ended after fifteen minutes, at which the lights disappeared and the crew regained their common sense. All three were rushed to be examined, and finding no clue as to how and why it happened, resumed their duty of transporting the object. 

- Some locations near the container have been temporarily distorted, giving the impression that something was sitting on it. The disturbance does not move, and usually dissipates after fifteen minutes. The materials the disturbance comes into contact with isn't affected in any way. 

**Addendum 494-B:** Analysis of SCP-494 

After analysis, these facts became known about SCP-494 and SCP-494-A: 

-SCP-494-A's molecular structure is similar to water, but we cannot determine the elements of the molecule, even after detailed 
spectrography. 

-SCP-494 is constructed from limestone commonly found in some Oceanic islands, including Samoa. The red ochre is determined to have come from Australia. 

-SCP-494-A has been monitored for the usual ripple behavior, but in the time period when we monitored it (a full week) it does not exhibit any of this. Requesting a high-definition camera to observe this behavior in storage. (pending) 

-SCP-494 and SCP-494-A's ability to defy gravity is speculated to have come from its structure and composition. 

-If SCP-494 is removed from SCP-494-A, SCP-494-A will stick to it with a consistency similar to starch, although it has been observed to "look like drool". 

-The three staff which were charged in transport of SCP-494 while the incident above happened were questioned. Staff A (who heard ocean waves) reported as such:

"I was carrying the object with ████████ and ███████ when these two lights appeared. I thought that it was just light playing tricks on me, but then I started to hear this… lapping of waves. At that moment I felt so… calm and… peaceful. I then let go of the object, I dunno why, I guess to feel it more. I was floating in a… supreme harmony, and then after what seems to have been hours I find myself on my knees, and my colleagues on the floor. We then proceeded to transport the object."

Staff B (who cried and wailed) reported as such:

"It was very weird, man. There I was one second, then I was in a coast I- don't-know-where. There were these people, like me, dressed in these sarong-like cloth. I also saw that I was one of them. We were escorting this girl to a kayak, then I saw her board that thing. At that moment I knew that she's not gonna return, and then I cried. I cried, and wailed, and I saw all the others also crying and wailing as the girl paddled out, going farther and farther. The last thing I remember afterwards, was of that girl, almost reaching the sunset… Then I saw all the other staff, all confused and stuff. We stayed silent about what happened until we were rushed here."

Staff C (who cried tears of SCP-494-A) reports as such:

"The moment those lights appeared, I'd be damned if what I saw next was just a hallucination. It was as if I'm dunked in an ocean of orange juice, and then there's this huge-ass creature. Whaddaya mean elaborate on it? Its hugeness is the only thing clear about it! Then I started noticing that there were other creatures around it, some looked like they were humans, some looked like sea creatures, and some are just… well, you know how it is about these things. All the time I could sense all of 
them, as if it was the real world. Ah yeah, I also saw some Polynesian girl approaching these creatures, and… and… oh man, they accepted her! I dunno what happened afterwards, 'cuz I was crying for the girl. It was as if someone close to you had died or something. Then I remembered being pulled out of that mess o' shit, and winding up in the storage room with 
the other fellas."
