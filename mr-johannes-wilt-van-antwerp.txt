title:Mr. Johannes "Wilt" van Antwerp
This is an author page of Mr Wilt that is right now just getting thrown up to stop the complaints of various users (most notably Zyn and Roget)

I will turn it into more of an author page when I have finished my current rewrite, which at the moment has a deadline.
