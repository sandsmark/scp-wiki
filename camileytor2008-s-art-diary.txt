Hello everyone, Camileytor2008 here. This is my SCP Art Diary, a personal project I began for my own amusement and as an attempt to try different things with my art style.
 
In a handmade sketchbook I've decided to draw daily as many SCPs as I can, ranging from the most classic and recognizable of them to some I feel deserve more love. I hope you enjoy them.
