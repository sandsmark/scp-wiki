title:Lest We Forget
The alarm went off.

Patterson slowly opened his eyes and stared at the stained ceiling as the chirping kept playing. He slowly propped himself up on his cot and looked at the clock, which was in the shape of a cartoon pink bunny. It was a gift from a researcher who worked here before. He couldn’t quite remember her name. Clock’s digital face flashed orange over and over in tune with the chirping. Patterson jabbed the off button and silenced it. He took a moment to scratch his side through his blue uniform.

He glanced around his cramped room and yawned at the same time. The chipped sink on the opposite side of the cot was leaked from the faucet. The mop that he had left leaning on the wall last night had fallen down beside the bright yellow bucket. Patterson’s radio laid on the plastic blue chair by the door, on top of his matching navy blue cap. Due to some kind of coincidence, the radio beeped.

“Janitor, we need you at the cafeteria immediately. Janitor, do you hear me? Get your ass down here.”

Patterson got to his feet, grabbed the bucket and mop, his radio, and the remaining part of his dignity.

The shiny white hallways of Site-19 greatly pleased Patterson. They made him feel clean and safe. He made his way down towards the elevator and tapped the button. Instantly the doors opened and Patterson was greeted by the sight of a security officer.

“Random check, show me your clearance card.”

Patterson chuckled.

“You’re kidding me right? Let me in the damn elevator.”

“Do I look like I’m kidding? Show me some ID or you’re in a world of hurt.”

Patterson quickly shuffled through the pockets of his navy blue jumpsuit. His hand found the plasticy feel of his Level One clearance card and dug it out. He handed it to the officer and saw his own reflection through the man’s faceplate. The officer glanced at the card and handed it back swiftly. He quickly hit a button inside and the doors closed in front of Patterson.

“You’ve got to be fucking kidding me.”

After a brief detour down the stairs, Patterson reached the Site-19 cafeteria. The smells of breakfast foods filled the air as the electronic doors slid open for him. It was breakfast hour and the room was almost full of researchers and guards. Even a few agents were there. He held his bucket close to his chest and walked through the bustling tables. He felt tense as his eyes met those of a stern faced scientist.

“There you are, what took you so long?”

Patterson stood quiet.

“Whatever. Some Junior Researcher dropped the bottle of ketchup and it broke by the drink machine. Clean it up please.”


In the janitor’s closet, Patterson flipped through the calendar hanging from the wall. His eyes zigzagged through the rows of days until he reached today’s date. In the little boxed numbered 16, he read the handwriting.

“**MONTHLY PSYCHOLOGICAL SCREENING**”

The letters were written in black ink and large font. It looked foreign for some reason. Patterson shrugged the thought off and went to report to the medical office. 

After a somewhat lengthy trip down the facility’s stairs, the janitor reached the medical wing. He scanned his card at the door. In the lobby of the wing, he was greeted by a single terminal. He walked up to and entered the requested information. 

“**PATTERSON, SCOTT//MONTHLY PSYCHOLOGICAL SCREENING**”

Patterson hit the enter key, and almost instantly the nearby metal door slid open. Out stepped a man dressed clad in a Foundation lab coat. He had dark skin, short curled white hair, and wore matching white glasses. His face looked worn down.

“Mr. Patterson, it’s nice to see you again.” 

The doctor’s face twitched.

“My name is Doctor Ocanas, we can perform your screening now. Please follow.” 

The doctor turned back through the metal door without looking back. Patterson followed closely behind. The two entered the first room on the right. The inside was dark and gray, with only one lamp hanging from the ceiling lighting up a metal table and two black folding chairs.

“Please, have a seat.” 

Patterson sat in the chair, the cold metal sending chills up his spine. Ocanas sat opposite of him. 

“Let’s begin.”

The janitor heard a footstep by the door and turned. In the doorway stood a stall white man dressed in a black suit. The Foundation logo was printed by where his heart would be in white. He wore sunglasses, and stared Patterson down.

“Don’t worry, that’s Agent McHendricks.” 

The doctor looked at the agent.

“It’s fine, you can leave us.” 

McHendricks nodded and stepped backwards out of the room. The metal door slid shut. Doctor Ocanas looked over at the janitor.

“Mr. Patterson… Please tell me your job description.” 

Patterson took a moment to think.

“I’m a janitor at this Site, Clearance Level One. I’m tasked with keeping the facility clean.” 

“The whole facility?”

“No, no. I’m not the only janitor. I just clean whatever they ask me to.” 

“Ok, how would you describe your conditions?”

“Um, I think they’re okay. Food is nice. I could use better quarters. My closet is really cramped most of the times.” 

The doctor produced a notepad and pencil.

“If you don’t mind, I’m going to start the psychological test now, Mr. Patterson.”

Patterson nodded firmly.

“I’m going to read out some numbers from my notepad, and I want you to tell me the first thing that comes to mind.”

The doctor flipped open the notepad and looked at the first line.

“173.”

Patterson’s eyes wided. He thought immediately of blood, feces, bones, and concrete.

“The drink machine, in the cafeteria.”

“Ah, maybe 173 is the code for your favorite drink?”

“Something like that.” 

Patterson fidgeted in his chair. His eyes darted around the room.

“096.”

Steel cube. Mauled bodies. Fingers.

“1996. My friend was born in 1996.” 

Doctor Ocanas looked up at Patterson.

“You seem uncomfortable, Mr. Patterson, we don’t have to continue.” 

“No, no. Please. I’m fine.” 

The janitor could feel the sweat sticking to the back of his jumpsuit.

“Okay, one quick question. Do your duties ever take you into the Euclid or Keter Class wings?”

Patterson hesitated.

“Oh, my bad. You probably know them as Light Containment and Heavy Containment.” 

“No Doctor, I’ve never been to those places. Other janitors go there. I don’t. I just mop the hallways and bathrooms. This morning I was at the cafeteria. Some idiot Junior Researched dropped the ketchup bottle. I cleaned it, I mopped it and I left and returned to my closet. I looked at the calendar and I had marked today as my monthly psych eval, but you don’t understand all of it. It wasn’t my handwriting, I didn't write it there. I don’t even have a goddamn pen!” 

Ocanas burst to his feet.

“Guards!” 

Immediately Agent McHendricks and another agent rushed through the metal door. They grabbed Patterson by the arms and pinned him to the metal table. Patterson squirmed and fought, but he couldn’t overcome the strength of the agents. McHendricks pulled back his suit jacket, revealing a holster holding several syringes. He looked at Ocanas.

“What’s it gonna be, Doc?”

“Class C, get him to medical after.” 

Patterson screamed as the syringe needle approached his neck. He kicked and jerked. It was all futile. 

The alarm went off. Patterson slowly opened his eyes and stared at the stained ceiling as the chirping kept playing. He slowly propped himself up on his cot and looked at the clock, which was in the shape of a cartoon pink bunny.
