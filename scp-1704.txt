**Item #:** SCP-1704

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1704 is to be kept in a 15m x 15m x 6m, humidity-controlled containment chamber at Site 23's Large Object Wing. All disappearances and remanifestations of SCP-1704 must be recorded, as well as all interactions between personnel and SCP-1704-1. Experimentation with or interaction with SCP-1704 requires permission from Dr. Galluzzo. Additionally, personnel requesting access to SCP-1704 for work related to Project Orpheus-30 must report directly to Liaison Barrett and Site Director Eriksson.

Ear protection is to be made available to personnel assigned to SCP-1704.

**Description:** SCP-1704 is an approximately 9m x 5.5m x 3.5m structure composed of animate, fully conscious human skeletons. The structure disappears and remanifests[[footnote]]That is to say, it ceases to exist in this reality and later resumes its existence.[[/footnote]] at irregular intervals; each time, the identity, arrangement, and exact number of SCP-1704-1 change.

Approximately 240 (Â± 30) fully intact skeletons compose the bulk of SCP-1704, the remainder being bones and bone fragments, along with a cementing material composed primarily of bone dust that holds the structure's shape. Instances of SCP-1704-1 have limited mobility and, provided that their jawbones are intact, vocal communication,[[footnote]]Instances of SCP-1704-1 communicate with voices appropriate for their stated identity.[[/footnote]] despite the lack of any muscles or organs that would be necessary for these activities. Separation of any section of SCP-1704 from the main mass has resulted in the cessation of all anomalous activity from the removed material, including demanifestation.

All skeletons composing SCP-1704, hereby SCP-1704-1, are capable of communication in at least one language, and those interviewed have been able to provide identities and personal information consistent with a person who has died within the past sixty years. Further commonalities between all interviewed members of SCP-1704-1 have been identified:
* The subject was sixty-eight years of age or older at time of death.
* The subject was a practicing member of an organized religion for at least thirty years and at the subject's time of death.
* The subject had no history of drug abuse, sexual activity, or violence outside of the prescribed limits of their chosen religion.
* The subject and their immediate family had no outstanding debts or obligations that were expected to cause significant financial distress at the time of the subject's death.
* The subject died of natural causes that were not attributable to environmental factors.
* At time of death, the subject felt contented with their life, had close relationships with all members of its extended family, and considered themselves ready to die.

Instances of SCP-1704-1 claim to recall events after their death and prior to incorporation into SCP-1704. While the exact imagery and sequence of events varies between subjects, all accounts involve the subject approaching a state which approximated their belief in the afterlife before being denied access by a hostile entity.[[footnote]]This entity has never been identified by the subjects -- physical descriptions vary, but rarely correlate with any real, fictional, or mythological entity with which the subject is familiar.[[/footnote]] This is frequently depicted as an act of envy or revenge. Subjects have identical recollections of being turned into a skeletal state and being deposited in and connected to SCP-1704 while inside an apparently featureless area. Those that have been interviewed on multiple occasions report returning to this area during times which SCP-1704 has demanifested, where other portions of SCP-1704 will be replaced or reorganized.

Typically, instances of SCP-1704-1 express feelings of hopelessness, confusion, and doubt, and are often reluctant to communicate with Foundation personnel or other SCP-1704-1. Subjects will often obsess over the details of their life, frequently questioning whether some unidentified "unfinished business" was responsible for their incorporation into SCP-1704.

Members of SCP-1704-1 uniformly report intense physical pain and discomfort resulting from a combination of high sensitivity to atmospheric conditions (particularly humidity and temperature), highly limited mobility, and the weight of the rest of SCP-1704. Due to this and the aforementioned psychological stress experienced by SCP-1704-1, distressed vocalizations are considered normal behavior.

Personnel with Clearance 4-1704 or higher (including those working on Project Orpheus-30) should consult Drs. Sanmugasunderam and O'Cruadhlaoich for theories regarding the exact nature and origin of SCP-1704.

**Addendum:** SCP-1704 was recovered from a Global Occult Coalition facility in Karlsruhe, Germany, in December 2012, along with three other items later given Special Containment Procedures and fourteen classified as Anomalous.[[footnote]]See documentation on Project Orpheus-30 and Joint SCP-GOC File 4-261 for further information.[[/footnote]] The Foundation was alerted to an XN-class Interdimensional Breach scenario in progress and provided relevant expertise (see Document 792-1704 for details), along with thirty-six Class D personnel. It was determined that extraction of a number of items (including SCP-1704) from the breach was necessary for full containment.

**Addendum:** Three instances of SCP-1704-1 have claimed identities consistent with persons who were listed as missing since the recovery of SCP-1704. Review of relevant GOC documents shows that these disappearances are consistent with the known activities and abilities of KTE-4821-Grey-Light (see Joint SCP-GOC File 4-261). In light of this, research regarding KTE-4821-Grey-Light has been incorporated into Project Orpheus-30, and SCP-1704's documentation is slated for additional updates.
