**Special Containment Procedures ##firebrick|(ARCHIVAL)##:** SCP-3723 is kept in Class-III humanoid living quarters at Site-43, and is to be provided with amended S/E humanoid privileges.[[footnote]] See //Ethics Committee Directive 83N72LT (Ethical Human(oid) Containment, Revision 5.1, 2012-07-19)//. [[/footnote]] Due to its anomalous biological processes, SCP-3723 does not require a meal schedule, only a standard supply of fresh water (distilled).

Additionally, SCP-3723 should be escorted to the onsite medical ward (Office 257B) for medication and psychiatric sessions with Dr. Khayyam on a weekly basis (and/or as otherwise scheduled).

**Description:** SCP-3723 is a severely emaciated human woman exhibiting numerous biological anomalies. It almost completely lacks subcutaneous fat, and suffers from osteoporosis and atrophy of cardiovascular tissue. Additionally, it is incapable of receiving nutrition, but does not require sustenance to survive; its digestive tract will reject and regurgitate any introduced solid or liquid foods.

Despite these serious medical issues, SCP-3723 is fully animate, semi-mobile (it reports that prolonged activities are painful), and displays no damage to cognition.

------

**Addendum 3723.I:** Background and Recovery

SCP-3723 is of Puerto Rican descent, and responds primarily to the name Olivia. Prior to containment, it resided in an apartment in Matthews, North Carolina, cohabited with an Ava ███-█████ (PoI-3723-β).

SCP-3723 initially garnered the attention of the Foundation in August 2016, when a phone call from a neighbor to the local police department was intercepted by monitoring bot LECTERN[[footnote]] Law Enforcement Communications Triage and External Rerouting Network. [[/footnote]]. Undercover agents from Mobile Task Force [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/task-forces#iota-10|Iota-10]]] ("Damn Feds") responded, and SCP-3723 was taken into custody.

Relevant civilians were amnesticized, with the exception of PoI-3723-β, whose memory alteration was postponed during a period of surveillance at the request of Dr. Jannings.

**Addendum 3723.II:** Psychiatric Evaluation

> **From:** Dr. Adileh Khayyam
> 
> **To:** Director ██████
> **CC:** Ethics Committee Liaison ████
> 
> **Subject:** SCP-3723 Diagnosis and Recommendations
> 
> **Content:** Director- Liaison- After two weeks of meetings with SCP-3723, I have prepared a psychological profile as you requested. My full report is attached below, but in summary: She is very ill.
> 
> SCP-3723 suffers from severe anorexia nervosa[[footnote]] An intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat, characterized by refusal to eat certain or any foods, causing dramatic weight loss and various other health problems. [[/footnote]], major depressive disorder, and body dysmorphic disorder. I would like to review the personnel assigned to SCP-3723. She already feels like a freak- she not only deserves, but //needs// to be treated with the utmost compassion.

{{2018-██-02}}

----

**Proposed by:** Dr. Khayyam, Dr. █████

**Approved by:** Superintendent ███████████

[[/=]]
----

**Abstract:** Due to the body of SCP-3723 lacking the necessary functions to heal atrophied muscles and repair other structures, an artificial solution has been deemed constructive.

**Procedure:**
* Silicone gel pads will be used to fill out sections of the chest, abdomen, and dorsal area.
* Tissue transplants, blood transfusions, and a polylactic acid-hydroxylapatite composite will reinforce the subject's muscle and bone structure. This may also improve energy and encourage more physical activity.

The surgery has been scheduled for 5 March. When informed of the procedure and its implications, SCP-3723 consented, but displayed an unexpected lack of enthusiasm. An ancillary therapy session with Dr. Khayyam has been recommended.

[[/div]]

------

**Addendum 3723.IV:** Incident 2018-03-05, 06:26

During a routine security check, SCP-3723 was found unconscious in its quarters, bleeding heavily from both wrists. A full sweep of the room found that the subject had covertly stolen multiple knives from the site cafeteria. Monitoring personnel have been disciplined and reassigned for this serious lapse in security.

Immediate transport to the onsite infirmary prevented the wounds from being fatal; the subject was temporarily sedated while Director ██████ met with medical personnel to discuss further proceedings. SCP-3723 has been placed on round-the-clock suicide watch.

Since the incident, SCP-3723 has become extremely asocial, ignoring attempts at communication and sleeping for unusually long periods. Attempts to administer recommended medications have failed. Medical personnel have denied proposals to forcibly medicate the subject via nasojejunal[[footnote]] Polyurethane tube threaded into the upper intestinal tract, used for patients who cannot process food in the stomach. [[/footnote]] feeding tube.

As a doctor I //cannot// allow this to continue, and I am sorely disappointed that EthCom has allowed it to reach this point. I don't want to, but I am prepared to pull rank on this. I've already drawn up my formal Medical Director's override[[footnote]] In high-priority medical situations, a site Medical Director can temporarily override the authority of Site Command. This caveat has only been invoked █ times since its conception in 1983. [[/footnote]], but I won't use it if I don't have to. This isn't for me, ███. This is for her. I've attached my proposal once more for your review. Look it over. Please. She needs our help.

**Addendum 3723.VI:** Interview 3723-β

> **Foreword:** Following repeated requests from Dr. Khayyam, site command authorized this meeting in light of SCP-3723's deteriorating mental health and refusal to communicate with personnel.

**Addendum 3723.VIII:** Ethics Committee Decision 2018-12-23

[[div style="border:solid 1px #999999; background:#ffffff; padding:15px 15px 15px 15px; margin-bottom: 10px;"]]
[[f>image http://scp-ru.wdfiles.com/local--files/list-of-foundation-s-internal-departments/com.png style="width:90px;"]]
++ From the Office of the Secretary of the Ethics Committee

Taking these facts into consideration:
* SCP-3723 poses a minimal threat to humanity at large, essentially no greater than an average non-anomalous person;
* SCP-3723 poses a limited threat to normalcy/Veil Protocols, as its anomalous properties are localized and can be effectively treated;
* SCP-3723 suffers from severe mental health issues, which have been worsened by containment to the point that the subject has attempted suicide;
* Outside of the aforementioned mental health issues, SCP-3723 has been compliant with Foundation personnel, displaying only a desire to neutralize its anomalous properties;

It would be flagrantly unethical to keep SCP-3723 contained in a negative environment. 

----

**PROCEDURAL REVISION PROPOSAL:** SCP-3723 will be escorted to its new location by Mobile Task Force Delta-6 ("Truants"). This is a secluded house in ██████████, ███ ████, owned by a Foundation front organization. SCP-3723 and its partner, Ava ███-█████, will be permitted to cohabit the residence. Additionally, the Medical Department will provide recommended medications (currently 30 mg fluoxetine and 25 mg hydroxyzine) and psychiatric services.

However, in order to maintain these freedoms, the following provisions will be followed:
# Any medical examinations must be performed by a Foundation doctor. Furthermore, the subject will undergo the procedures outlined in the 2018-██-02 Medical report, so as to disguise its anomalous appearance from uninformed observers.
# Both subjects will submit to amnesticization (Class-A: subjects will retain necessary information, but not anything posing a possible security threat).
# Mobile Task Force Phi-Eolh ("Provident Trawlers") will perform security check-ins on a weekly (until ██/██/████), monthly (██/██/████ to ██/██/████), and biannual (beginning ██/██/████) basis, as well as random visits. During these meetings, SCP-3723 should notify personnel of any planned excursions (i.e. out-of-state vacations).
