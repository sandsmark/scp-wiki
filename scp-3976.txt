**Item #:** SCP-3976

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Foundation webcrawlers and personnel are to monitor media channels for any signs of an SCP-3976 manifestation. Once detected, containment and security personnel under the guise of UK national law enforcement are to be dispatched to the site of SCP-3976 to secure a perimeter and investigate the manifestation.

**Description:** SCP-3976 is the collective term for a series of manifestations of apparent murder scenes of famous mystery writer Agatha Christie[[footnote]] Christie died of natural causes in 1976. [[/footnote]]. Thus far, every SCP-3976 instance has been located in rural England, and all components of each instance have been limited to a 50 meter radius. Additionally, every instance has appeared between the hours of 22:31 and 08:36, local time, although no records or witnesses of a manifestation event exist. 

Each SCP-3976 instance consists of the following components:

* A copy of the corpse of Agatha Christie[[footnote]] Christie's corpse was exhumed for comparison and control, and has been confirmed to be a separate object from the manifested corpse. However, DNA analysis has shown that the copies are genetically identical to Christie's real corpse. [[/footnote]], designated SCP-3976. In each recorded instance, the corpse shows signs of violent struggle or murder.
* A number of items in some way related to murder. For instance, a murder weapon such as a gun or knife, or a personal artifact, such as a piece of jewelry or a diary.

In no recorded SCP-3976 instance have there been any witnesses to a killing.
