**Item #:** SCP-2835

**Object Class:** --Safe-- --Keter-- Safe[[footnote]] See Finalized Containment Procedures Note [[/footnote]]

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2835 is to be permanently contained in its locker at Site-59. Additional viewings have been prohibited by order of Dr. Lisle Naismith.

**Description:** SCP-2835 is a VHS video cassette of a previously unreleased episode of //The Adventures of Paddy the Pelican//, a short-lived WENR-TV cartoon series from the fall of 1950. The episode is titled "Love Me, Do It!" 

SCP-2835 is longer than the average episode of the show, running for 30 minutes as opposed to five minutes. Although the plot remains largely the same (Paddy the Pelican searching for his long-lost father), the content of SCP-2835 changes depending on the reaction of the viewer. The title character (referred to as 2835-1) will periodically interact with the viewers and prod them to express their opinion of the cartoon so far, often in a defensive, demanding, and often threatening manner. Contrary to earlier episodes of the show, SCP-2835-1 displays characteristics of extreme paranoia and demands constant affirmation.

> **SCP-2835-1:** So Freddy Fox knows who my real father is? Ain't that a laugh and a half. Who were you expecting my father to be, █████ ██████████?
> 
> **D-2239:** How do you know my name?
> 
> **SCP-2835-1:** No, no, no, no-no-no-no-no. We're not doing this "answer a question with a question" crap. I asked you who you think my real father is. I think I'm entitled to an answer, █████. Do you have //any// idea how hard I worked on this episode?!

> **D-2239:** ...Kenny Crow is your dad?

> **SCP-2835-1:** Good Christ, are you blind?! Kenny and I are like the same age. I mean, where did you get the idea that he's my old man? Am I really being that confusing?!

> **SCP-2835-1:** I'm talking to you, ██████.
> 
> **D-2419:** Excuse me?
> 
> **SCP-2835-1:** I'm holding an ice cream cone. It looks delicious. Don't you think it looks delicious? This isn't hard, ██████. I know you didn't go to college or anything, but don't tell me you're so stupid you don't know what a good ice cream cone looks like.
> 
> **D-2419:** The fuck?
> 
> **SCP-2835-1:** Yes, or no? Is this ice cream delicious? God! I put all this work into making this ice cream look tasty, and here you are twiddling your thumbs at me. Do you have any idea how disrespectful that is?!
> 
> **D-2419:** Dude, your cartoon isn't even that great. A lot of the animation just cycles over itself without any regard for lip syncing.

> **SCP-2835-1:** //No!// You //had// your chance to watch my work respectfully, you inbred horse-fucker. Then look what you did? "Daaah, dude, fuck you, I could be a better cartoon pelican than you ever could be, I brush my teeth with bacon grease, what's long division?"

> **SCP-2835-1:** Ever heard of the conqueror worm, you disrespectful sack of shit?! Everything gets what they deserve. Even the undeserving get what they deserve.  But the deserving? The deserving! Oh, yeah. You and everyone you love! Reap what you sow! I am gonna enjoy every second of this, and you've got no one to blame but yourself. Reap what you sow! Reap what you sow! Reap what you sow! Reap what--

**Addendum:** On 2/19/16, exactly 24 hours after D-2419 viewed SCP-2835, D-2419 was found dead in his cell. The cause of death was rapid dehydration - the cadaver was devoid of all bodily fluids. The means of this death is unknown, and the lost fluids were never recovered.

Later that day, the residence of D-2419's family at 2499 N. ████ Terrace in ██████, Indiana, was found to contain the dehydrated corpses, of Mrs. ██████, her five children, and a dog. Upon forensic analysis, the deaths had occurred simultaneously to the death of D-2419. All foliage in the vicinity had also been suddenly dehydrated.

Similar incidents had also been discovered with other D-class personnel that had interacted negatively with SCP-2835-1. For more information, see the extended testing log.

These incidents also mirror an incident that law enforcement authorities had discovered in Chicago on October 20th, 1950, which resulted in the anomalous dehydration of the entire staff of WENR-TV. The case was transferred to the Unusual Incidents Unit of the FBI, and containment action was repeatedly postponed due to the lack of repeat incidents.

**Note on the Finalized Containment Procedures:**
> I've been hearing some suggestions to switch over SCP-2835 to Keter, and implications that Paddy is some kind of trickster god that can kill anyone who offends him whenever he pleases. That he demands total devotion or death.
> 
> I know we need to be careful, as we have dealt with omniscient reality benders in the past. But here's the thing: have any of you considered just //not watching his video?//
