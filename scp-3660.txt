**Item #:** SCP-3660

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3660 is to be kept in a standard, secure locker. Personnel handling SCP-3660 are required to wear gloves.

**Description:** SCP-3660 is a metal zipper, similar to those found on sweaters and backpacks. SCP-3660's anomalous effects only manifest when it is pushed into the skin of a human being. Tests on non-human entities have yielded no results. Surgical removal of SCP-3660 prior to activation has been discovered to be capable of preventing its otherwise inevitable effect.

Upon being pushed against the surface of a subject's skin, SCP-3660 will sink into the flesh until only the pull-tab is visible. Subjects have reported feeling an itch at this location, but rarely significant pain. Within 10 minutes, SCP-3660 will 'activate' and drag itself across the skin, effectively 'unzipping' the host. SCP-3660 detach from the skin after creating its opening, on average 40 centimeters in length. This process will cause the subject's body to hollow. The texture and composition of the subject's former skin will become identical to that of synthetic latex, making reapplication of SCP-3660 impossible. Simultaneously, an animal bearing the subject's consciousness will be created inside the skin. This animal will always be an amniote, cephalopod, or chondrichthyan. Extensive testing has failed to result in the creation of animals from other clades and classes. Testing as to whether the animals are created at random, or in accordance to a yet undiscovered pattern --is ongoing-- is pending approval.

Subjects post-transformation are consistently able to confirm their human identity, through means such as standard memory tests and communicated testimony via prompted writing and/or gestures. Additionally, subjects are observed as being consistently proficient in operating their new forms. Examples of this include, but are not limited to, fin propelled locomotion, winged flight and prehensile tail manipulation. The transformation is, thus far, irreversible. Testing into this matter is ongoing.

**Addendum 3660-A:** Following review of Incident 3660-A, research personnel physically interacting with SCP-3660 are required to wear full-body, hazardous material suits. Local anesthesia and scalpels are to be kept in the testing area within a secure case.

**Addendum 3660-B:** In response to the increasing number and variety of animals being contained at Site-23, the logistical costs of habitat construction, Test 3660-577 and the results of said test, all experiments with SCP-3660 are to cease until further notice.

**Incident Report:** Following Test 3660-012, research personnel consisting of Researcher Dr. Scarcliffe and Junior Researcher Dr. Chelsea entered the testing area in order to assess any compositional changes in SCP-3660. Experimental precautions in line with Foundation protocol and pre-addendum 3660-A special containment procedures were followed. Dr. Chelsea held SCP-3660 with tweezers while Dr. Scarcliffe recorded. Three minutes after interaction began, the sector experienced a temporary power outage. The outage lasted for approximately 10 seconds.

Upon reviewing testimony from both parties, it has been concluded that it was Dr. Chelsea who failed to react calmly to the power outage, resulting in SCP-3660 embedding into Dr. Scarcliffe's right cheek. At the time, the knowledge that surgical removal of SCP-3660 served as an effective countermeasure had yet to be discovered. SCP-3660 activated in 3 minutes and 8 seconds.

Both the Black Mamba created by SCP-3660 and Junior Researcher Dr. Chelsea were treated for shock and snake-bite, respectively. Dr. Chelsea has since been reprimanded and re-assigned. Dr. Scarcliffe has been allowed to return to her duties provided she accept psychological therapy, evaluations and the necessary revisions to her contract.

**Subject:** D-2111
**Procedure:** Subject was stripped and locked in the center of the testing area via ankle-locks. Research personnel inserted SCP-3660 to the subject's chest while security restrained the arms. Testing area was evacuated and the subject was monitored.
**Results:** SCP-3660 activated at 8 minutes and 24 seconds after implanting. At this point, view of SCP-3660 was obstructed by the emergence of a Blue Whale. Damage to Site-23 and its personnel was exacerbated by the resultant 6/C/18-1-23 intensity containment breach.  SCP-3660 was successfully recovered during reconstruction of testing chamber.
**Analysis:** N/A

> **Interviewed:** Dr. Stephanie Scarcliffe
> 
> **Interviewer:** Senior Researcher Dr. Arjan Wallace
> 
> **Foreword:** Post-Test A577 interview between Dr. Wallace and Dr. Scarcliffe regarding the addition of Addendum 3660-B and the re-assignment of the latter. Dr. Scarcliffe has been given a text-to-speech synthesizer operating on a touch-screen keyboard. Key size has been resized appropriately for Dr. Scarcliffe’s snout.
> 
> <Begin Log>
> 
> **Dr. Wallace:** Have you gotten used to the program yet?
> 
> **Dr. Scarcliffe:** The program is fine. Voice is robotic. Accent is wrong.
> 
> **Dr. Wallace:** It'll do until the custom one is finished. Scarcliffe, I’ll be brief. We’re stopping experimentation with SCP-3660.
> 
> **Dr. Scarcliffe:** No. Why?
> 
> **Dr. Wallace:** I hear it has something to do with the whale that materialized in the middle of this facility-don’t hiss at me, Scarcliffe. But that’s not the best part. The MTF beret that just left? He was telling me all about how once his people came to that sector, they saw nothing but jungle animals running around.  He asked me if I was setting up a zoo. A zoo! You’re the one who set up the zoo, not me, but I took it. I said "yes, sir it was me indeed" and now you’re going to explain yourself so I have //something// to say when the big bad suit comes down here in 2 hours.
> 
> **Dr. Scarcliffe:** Not a zoo. Long term research. All recovered?
> 
> **Dr. Wallace:** Did we recover them all? No, we didn't recover them all! More than half of your 577 creatures were...Jesus Christ. 577. You've been doctoring your reports, keeping half a thousand for yourself while my official record states we haven't even reached 100 tests. That's not long term research, that’s a fucking production line. 
> 
> **Dr. Scarcliffe:** Long term research. Still more to discover. Pattern maybe. Reversal maybe.
> 
> **Dr. Wallace:** Yes. Reversal. I know. We’ve done all the testing we can on that damn zipper after it's used. You might actually get new data if you dedicated your time to studying the subjects already affected rather then by creating your little ecosystem.
> 
> **Dr. Scarcliffe:** No. Personal log accomplishes that. I need authorization to add skin-graft variable into next 5 tests. 20 would be ideal. 
> 
> **Dr. Wallace:** No. Enough. Stop typing and listen to me. The decision to halt experimentation’s already been made. If you keep trying to justify why //this// needs to keep happening, even after all //this//, I’ll be convinced that you’ve lost it. And I will report it as such.
> 
> **Dr. Scarcliffe:** You can't say that while looking me in the eye.
> 
> **Dr. Wallace:** Look. Steph, I don’t know what it’s like to be…like you. And I’m sorry for what happened to.
> 
> **Dr. Scarcliffe:** Not your fault. I listened to the twitchy idiot.
> 
> **Dr. Wallace:** They wanted to shut you down earlier, you know? We all knew that zipper's roulette wheel was eventually going to stop on something problematic. I expected the end would come as an apex predator controlled by a mass-murderer.
> 
> **Dr. Scarcliffe:** Personally expected psycho elephant.
> 
> **Dr. Wallace:** So, how long do snakes live?
> 
> **Dr. Scarcliffe:** Black Mamba observed living for around 10 years in captivity. Could be more. Provided optimal conditions.
> 
> **Dr. Wallace:** Do you know how much time you have left?
> 
> **Dr. Scarcliffe:** No. Effects of SCP-3660 on life-span ongoing. Not even necessary if. Reversal. Is. Found.  Do not stop experimentation. Please.
> 
> **Dr. Wallace:** Then why would you sabotage yourself by-I’ll try to talk to them. You have a bit of bargaining credit: agreeing to 'donate' animals with human intelligence to other teams has given you a small mountain of goodwill, especially from the folks studying [REDACTED]. But even then, the whale will have to go obviously-a lot of the others too, but I might be able to convince the director to allow experimentation with some of the current, low-maintenance subjects. No promises.
> 
> **Dr. Scarcliffe:** Thank you.
> 
> **Dr. Wallace:** Hold on to that for a bit. //If// I do get testing to continue, I’ll arrange for any pertinent developments to be forwarded to you.
> 
> **Dr. Scarcliffe:** Why? I’ll be overseeing.
> 
> **Dr. Wallace:** No. No you won’t. I don’t know if this is a punishment or a promotion, but you’re being transferred. End of this week.
>
> <End Log>
> 
> **Closing Statement:** Site-23 Administration approved proposal submitted by Dr. Wallace recommending the removal of 435 of SCP-3660's long term research subjects, and the transfer of Dr. Scarcliffe to Site-19 as opposed to [REDACTED]. Experimentation into the remaining long term subjects has been allowed to resume.
