You enter the restaurant. The ambiance is dim and dark enough to be classy. You can hear the low murmuring of other patrons. There is a hint of foreign spices in the air. 

You are approached by a maître d'. His hair is slicked back, and his mustache is sharp enough to cut the air. He gestures towards you. 

//"Table pour une?"//

Indeed. In your best French, you reply. 

//"Oui."//

After sitting you down, he hands you a single paged menu. You read the front.

> Located in scenic Ohio, Bishop's Glen has all sorts of wonderful activities for the whole family. Just mind your step. This Riesling pairs well with any dry dish, and should provide a light, but impactful flavor.

You flip the menu over. There's a large stain of something covering part of it. You take a sniff. 

//Ravioli.//

You read.

As you debate your choices, you take a glance over near the back of the establishment. You can faintly overhear a woman arguing with a waiter; apparently her fourteen-cheese lobster bisque only contains twelve and a half cheeses. 

Near the back you can see a portrait. The man depicted is so mediocre in appearance you forget what he looks like immediately. Maybe its anti-memetic? 

You strain your eyes and can make out the information under the painting.
