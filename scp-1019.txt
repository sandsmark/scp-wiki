**Item #:** SCP-1019

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** As SCP-1019 is transient in nature, current containment procedures are geared towards minimizing public knowledge of SCP-1019. When a phenomenon is recognized as an instance of SCP-1019, a decision should be made by a Level 3 or greater researcher on whether to document it immediately, or let it expire naturally, based on possibility of exposure to the public. Heuristic word processing algorithms are to be used on all SCP Foundation files for the possibility of documenting an instance of SCP-1019 before being uploaded to the main database, to avoid an unintentional disabling of the current instance.

An investigation to discover the identity of the entity or entities known as "WAW" is presently underway. 

**Description:** SCP-1019 is the designation given to a series of --20-- --73-- more than 100 loosely related phenomena documented by the SCP Foundation since December 13, 2007. Instances of SCP-1019 have only six documented similarities, and have varied widely in every other respect. 

1: Instances of SCP-1019 are localized to either one object or an area of no greater than 20 square meters.
2: Instances of SCP-1019 are not directly harmful to human life.
3: Instances of SCP-1019 are accompanied by an odor of lavender, tea tree oil, Irish Spring soap, or lime.
4: Instances of SCP-1019 are accompanied by a sensation of tingling in the fingertips of the left hand.
5: Instances of SCP-1019 cease being anomalous or completely disappear 90 days after their inception or at the time of their documentation in official SCP Foundation files, whichever happens first.
6: Instances of SCP-1019, upon ceasing to function, manifest within the area of effect a slip of paper 3x3 centimeters, displaying on one side a white sigil associated with Modern Chaos Magic[[footnote]] A recently formed school of magical theory that combines traditional symbol and ingredient based magical practice with the use of advanced technology. [[/footnote]] on a black background with the letters WAW in the center. The reverse side always contains a message in black text on a white background. These slips of paper are not otherwise anomalous, and have been designated SCP-1019-A. 

It is important to note that phenomena that fit these conditions are not SCPs in their own right; rather, they are instances of SCP-1019, apparently created by an unknown entity, suspected to be a talented anartist.[[footnote]] Creator of anomalous objects or scenarios as an artistic expression.
