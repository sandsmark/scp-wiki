**Item #:** SCP-5166

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5166 is to be kept in a sealed case in Storage Unit-27 of Site-22, which is kept under guard by two security personnel at all times. Once a day, janitorial staff are to retrieve any paper attached to this case for recycling purposes.

**Description:** SCP-5166 is a small notebook with illegible text written on its surface in pencil. 

At variable intervals, scraps of paper similar in appearance to SCP-5166 will appear stuck to any object in its immediate vicinity. To date, these objects have included:

* SCP-5166's containment unit.
* Instruments being used to inspect SCP-5166.
* Personnel inspecting SCP-5166.
* Vermin passing SCP-5166's containment unit[[footnote]] See Infestation Report 22-2020. [[/footnote]].
* Itself.
* Scraps of paper created by itself.

In contrast to the illegible writing present on SCP-5166, legible writing is present on the additional paper scraps it creates. This writing invariably takes the form of a supposed message from an individual or group claiming responsibility for the creation of the object the paper is stuck to, along with an explanation for where the object came from or what its purpose is. Without exception, all of these explanations to date have been incorrect.

SCP-5166 was purchased by Agent Green during his annual mandated attendance of the Andersen Auction of Abnormalities in Yorkshire, England. A full list of anomalies which were brought into containment at this time is available in the Site-22 archives.

**Addendum 5166-2:** Since 13/09/2019, all messages produced by SCP-5166 have been crude imitations of official Foundation documentation, and the rate of their appearance have severely increased. In addition, personnel have noted an apparent increase in the excitement and investment of the writer, although due to the subjectivity of the claim this cannot be confirmed.
