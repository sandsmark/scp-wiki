**Item #:** SCP-1974-EX

**Object Class:** --Safe-- Explained

**Special Containment Procedures:** --SCP-1974 specimens are to be contained in Low-Value Item Storage at Site 61, when not needed for experiments.-- //SCP-1974-EX specimens are to be contained in a standard small-item lockbox in the Research and Development storage area of Site-55.// 

When handled by personnel not being subjected to an experiment, butyl rubber or nitrile (NBR) rubber gloves should be worn to prevent exposure to --anomalous effects-- //drugs embedded within the SCP-1974-EX material//.  Affected personnel must be removed from duty and quarantined until the effects of SCP-1974//-EX// wear off (approximately 36 hours).

--Field agents have been issued Order 61-1974-B; a //low-priority// directive to capture and contain SCP-1974 specimens not under Foundation control, and gather evidence as to their source.-- Field Order 61-1974-B rescinded 08/16/1992. 

**Description:** SCP-1974//-EX// are 20-sided dice (commonly referred to as d20s in role-playing games) which appear to be composed of a standard acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) polymer.  

Anyone handling SCP-1974//-EX// for five minutes continually, or over approximately one hour when SCP-1974//-EX// is used in a typical role-playing game, is subject to the effects of hallucinations and extreme suggestibility.  When SCP-1974//-EX// is used in a role-playing game, approximately 90% of affected subjects believe the game parameters and environment to be real, and begin to act accordingly.  Effects typically persist for 36 hours.  The remaining 10% of exposed subjects experience miscellaneous hallucinations typical of an unintentional exposure to LSD-25 or psilocybin, as do subjects exposed to SCP-1974//-EX// and not offered intentional or unintentional behavior suggestions.

--It is currently being investigated whether the effects of SCP-1974 are chemical, memetic, or supernatural.--

//Analysis has determined that in SCP-1974-EX, the ABS has been combined with [REDACTED], a solvent and carrier similar to Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), but solid at room temperature.  This is used to introduce a dose of an r-Ergotamine derivative, a long-acting hallucinogen.  In addition, SCP-1974-EX contains a transmitter emitting non-audible sounds at frequencies of [REDACTED], generating a psychoacoustic effect that combines with the hallucinogen to cause extreme suggestibility in SCP-1974-EX-exposed subjects.//

//Since SCP-1974-EX is merely a novel means of hypnotizing subjects and secretively dosing them with hallucinogens, it is hereby declassified as an SCP and removed from the main SCP database as of 08/16/1992.  Collection of further uncontained specimens is now a police matter and will not be conducted by Foundation Agents.//

//Due to the potential uses in clandestine activities and humanoid SCP control, Foundation Research and Development has requisitioned the supply of SCP-1974-EX, and is developing the means to reproduce its effects in different formats.[[footnote]] The Foundation takes no responsibility for the presence of hallucinogenic pens at the Marshall Carter & Dark auction on  █/██/20██.[[/footnote]]//

**Addendum:** SCP-1974//-EX// came to the Foundation's attention when a large quantity were distributed as free samples during [REDACTED] Con, a Science Fiction and Fantasy convention held in ████████, ██ on █/██-██/19██.  Over 200 individuals were detained after exhibiting bizarre behavior resulting in █ fatalities, ██ injuries, and numerous incidents of property damage and disorderly conduct.  ███ specimens of SCP-1974//-EX// were confiscated, and the incident attributed to mass hysteria caused by an unusual variety of food poisoning.  

**Incident Log 1974-01:** The following is an excerpt from a list of incidents reported shortly after the initial release of SCP-1974//-EX// to the public.  It demonstrates that while many affected subjects engage in harmless but absurd behavior, others pose a danger to themselves and others, especially to unsuspecting or defenseless persons.  

* █████ ██████; severely beat █████ Hotel doorman; believed victim was “an orc.” Subject successfully restrained with minor injuries.

* ████ ████████; restrained while “casting a fireball” by chanting in an unknown language, waving a pool cue, and burning a carefully arranged circle of kitchen spices.  No injuries reported.

* ███████ ████; claimed to work for [REDACTED] after playing a game of “Paranoia”; interrogated and released when it was determined that subject had no knowledge of genuine classified information.

* █████ █████; killed by ████████ police after charging a group of officers with a butcher knife, while shouting “Blood for the Blood God!” 

* ███ ███████; attempted to sacrifice his sister to “summon Yog Sothoth” after playing “Call of Cthulhu”. [DATA EXPUNGED].

//The source of SCP-1974-EX remains unknown.  Relevant information anonymously transferred to ████████, ██ Police Department for continuing investigation.//
