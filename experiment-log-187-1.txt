**Experiment Log of:** Dr.Gears, testing exposure of SCP-187 to other SCP items.

**Date:** ██-██-████ to ██-██-████

------

**Experiment-01:**  Exposure to [[[SCP-173]]]

SCP-187 produced a sustained scream for one minute, thirty-eight seconds before losing consciousness and falling to the ground.  SCP-187 had to be physically removed, and maintained a state of catatonia for 48 hours.  SCP-187 regained consciousness, but was unable to remember what she had seen, and remained in mild shock for several days.

------

**Experiment-02:**  Exposure to [[[SCP-139]]]

SCP-187 stated that she saw several bone fragments scattered around, along with [DATA EXPUNGED], as yet not identified.  SCP-187 became extremely upset, screaming “it can see me!  it’s out, it can fucking see me!” several times, and had to be physically restrained and removed.

------

**Experiment-03:**  Exposure to [[[SCP-162]]]

SCP-187 felt no “pull” from SCP-162, and requested why she was viewing a pile of melted slag.  SCP-187 removed from containment without incident.

------

**Experiment-04:**  Exposure to [[[SCP-529]]]

SCP-187 appeared very nervous, asking “is this a joke?” several times.  SCP-187 reported that she saw a cat, and that it looked somewhat lonely.  SCP-187 proceeded to pet SCP-529, moving her hand over where the hindquarters would be, as if stroking the tail.  Increased observation of SCP-529 requested.

------

**Experiment-05:**  Exposure to [[[scp-003-arc]]]

SCP-187 appeared nervous, then said “hello” to SCP-003.  SCP-187 appeared to then engage in conversation with SCP-003; however no member of staff was able to hear any speech or other auditory emanations from SCP-003.  When questioned, SCP-187 responded that SCP-003 was “A very nice lady, she seems really smart.”  Increased security and review of SCP-003 has been requested.

------

**Experiment-06:**  Exposure to [[[SCP-882]]]

SCP-187 entered the containment area, and viewed SCP-882.  SCP-187 moved back several steps, and appeared to be in mild shock.  SCP-187 was questioned, and responded “Jesus…it’s huge…this is…amazing.”  SCP-187 stopped responding to questions and continued to stare at SCP-882 without blinking for three minutes. SCP-187 had to be physically removed from the containment area to continue questioning.  SCP-187 appeared dazed, and responded: “it’s so…I mean, it’s so complex…it’s sick, with all the bones and blood in it, but it looks like the inside of a fifty foot tall clock.  It’s…kinda pretty.”  

Shortly before SCP-187 was returned to containment, SCP-187 suddenly fell to the ground, screaming and holding her head.  After several hours, during which SCP-187 was heavily sedated and unresponsive to questioning, SCP-187 reported “grinding, smashing, squealing…it sounded like a train wreck that just went on and on.”  SCP-187 reported the sound lasted for approximately three hours before fading out of hearing. Increased security around SCP-882 has been requested

[DATA REDACTED]

------

**Experiment-08:** Exposure to [[[SCP-015]]]

SCP-187 was exposed to SCP-015, with the help of team Zeta-9.  SCP-187 reported only slight differences in the structure, until she opened a door leading outside of SCP-015.  SCP-187 reported a hallway of pipes stretching for “miles and miles.” SCP-187 stated that she was not able to see the other end of the hall, but that it “seemed to branch off to the sides, with lots of side hallways.”  Zeta-9 team members reported no unusual behavior within SCP-015, and that the door opened into open air, with no hallway of any kind visible.
