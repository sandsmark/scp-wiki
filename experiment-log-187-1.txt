**Experiment Log of:** Dr.Gears, testing exposure of SCP-187 to other SCP items.

**Date:** ██-██-████

------

**Experiment-01:**  Exposure to [[[SCP-173]]]

SCP-187 produced a sustained scream for one minute, thirty-eight seconds before losing consciousness and falling to the ground.  SCP-187 had to be physically removed, and maintained a state of catatonia for 48 hours.  SCP-187 regained consciousness, but was unable to remember what she had seen, and remained in mild shock for several days.

------

**Experiment-02:**  Exposure to [[[SCP-139]]]

SCP-187 stated that she saw several bone fragments scattered around, along with [DATA EXPUNGED], as yet not identified.  SCP-187 became extremely upset, screaming “it can see me!  it’s out, it can fucking see me!” several times, and had to be physically restrained and removed.

------

**Experiment-03:**  Exposure to [[[SCP-162]]]

SCP-187 felt no “pull” from SCP-162, and requested why she was viewing a pile of melted slag.  SCP-187 removed from containment without incident.

------

**Experiment-04:**  Exposure to [[[SCP-529]]]

SCP-187 appeared very nervous, asking “is this a joke?” several times.  SCP-187 reported that she saw a cat, and that it looked somewhat lonely.  SCP-187 proceeded to pet SCP-529, moving her hand over where the hindquarters would be, as if stroking the tail.  Increased observation of SCP-529 requested.
