**Experiment Log of:** Dr.Gears, testing exposure of SCP-187 to other SCP items.

**Date:** ██-██-████ to ██-██-████

------

**Experiment-01:**  Exposure to [[[SCP-173]]]

SCP-187 produced a sustained scream for one minute, thirty-eight seconds before losing consciousness and falling to the ground.  SCP-187 had to be physically removed, and maintained a state of catatonia for 48 hours.  SCP-187 regained consciousness, but was unable to remember what she had seen, and remained in mild shock for several days.

------

**Experiment-02:**  Exposure to [[[SCP-139]]]

SCP-187 stated that she saw several bone fragments scattered around, along with [DATA EXPUNGED], as yet not identified.  SCP-187 became extremely upset, screaming “it can see me!  it’s out, it can fucking see me!” several times, and had to be physically restrained and removed.

------

**Experiment-03:**  Exposure to [[[SCP-162]]]

SCP-187 felt no “pull” from SCP-162, and requested why she was viewing a pile of melted slag.  SCP-187 removed from containment without incident.

------

**Experiment-04:**  Exposure to [[[SCP-529]]]

SCP-187 appeared very nervous, asking “is this a joke?” several times.  SCP-187 reported that she saw a cat, and that it looked somewhat lonely.  SCP-187 proceeded to pet SCP-529, moving her hand over where the hindquarters would be, as if stroking the tail.  Increased observation of SCP-529 requested.

------

**Experiment-05:**  Exposure to [[[SCP-003]]]

SCP-187 appeared nervous, then said “hello” to SCP-003.  SCP-187 appeared to then engage in conversation with SCP-003; however no member of staff was able to hear any speech or other auditory emanations from SCP-003.  When questioned, SCP-187 responded that SCP-003 was “A very nice lady, she seems really smart.”  Increased security and review of SCP-003 has been requested.

------

**Experiment-06:**  Exposure to [[[SCP-882]]]

SCP-187 entered the containment area, and viewed SCP-882.  SCP-187 moved back several steps, and appeared to be in mild shock.  SCP-187 was questioned, and responded “Jesus…it’s huge…this is…amazing.”  SCP-187 stopped responding to questions and continued to stare at SCP-882 without blinking for three minutes. SCP-187 had to be physically removed from the containment area to continue questioning.  SCP-187 appeared dazed, and responded: “it’s so…I mean, it’s so complex…it’s sick, with all the bones and blood in it, but it looks like the inside of a fifty foot tall clock.  It’s…kinda pretty.”  

Shortly before SCP-187 was returned to containment, SCP-187 suddenly fell to the ground, screaming and holding her head.  After several hours, during which SCP-187 was heavily sedated and unresponsive to questioning, SCP-187 reported “grinding, smashing, squealing…it sounded like a train wreck that just went on and on.”  SCP-187 reported the sound lasted for approximately three hours before fading out of hearing. Increased security around SCP-882 has been requested
