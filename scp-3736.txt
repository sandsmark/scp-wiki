**Item #:** SCP-3736

**Object Class:** Safe

**Containment Procedures:** SCP-3736 is to be contained in Low-Security Locker 34 at Site 21. SCP-3736 is to be released and be engaged with by any C Class Personnel or higher at least once a day. SCP-3736's locker is to be furnished with a chargeable light that must remain on at all times while it is inside. This light is to be recharged when SCP-3736 is outside it's locker.  

**Description:** SCP-3736 is a standard Bop It! model with audio commands as well as multiple game modes. SCP-3736 is part of a discontinued brand referred to as Bop It Extreme 2. SCP-3736 can be played as a standard Bop It! with commands to twist and pull it's respective cranks. However SCP-3736's anomalous effect occurs after three successful consecutive actions, after which SCP-3736 will attempt to converse with the player who had performed it's requested actions. To The Foundation's knowledge SCP-3736 can only communicate using single syllable words followed by "It".

SCP-3736 appears to be desparate for human contact and continuously repeated "Help It!" upon being activated after recovery. SCP-3736 appears to be incapable of using words that are not verbs or adverbs with the exception of certain cases but appears to have learned to communicate more efficiently using slang. When asked a question that would require an answer of "yes", SCP-3736 will respond with "Know It!" and will respond with "Not It!" if responding to a question that would require an answer of "no". SCP-3736 appears to enjoy being in The Foundation's custody and is grateful that it has been granted access with people to talk to.

**Addendum: 3736-1** SCP-3736 was recovered from an apartment in █████████, Texas on █████ █, ████. It had reached The Foundation's interest when a report of a Bop It! toy displaying unusual and disturbing commands. The residents interviewed had begun to respond to SCP-3736 but eventually grew fearful of the toy and sent it to the manufacturer who had no explaination for SCP-3736's properties. It was initially found afterwards by Local Foundation Intelligence and transferred to Site 21. The owners as well as the manufacturers contacted were administered Class B amnestics.

**Addendum: 3736-2** SCP-3736 is shown to be aware that it is not human and shows respect for those who care for it. It holds a great amount of love for people and shows kindness towards anyone who speaks to it. It can differentiate between who uses it and seems to possess a photographic memory. It is unknown how this is possible due to it lacking any human senses. It is presumed that SCsP3736 holds some sort of telepathic quality that allows it to communicate with humans and recognize them.
