O5-4, O5-10, please share this with your fellow overseers. The clearance level is to assure that O5-3 does not suspect that she has been excluded.

We need to talk about O5-3.

O5-3 has been infected by SCP-5095. I've included the documentation for it below:

[[div style="display: block ; border : none ; background: #FFFFFF ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding : 20px; box-shadow : 0 0 7px rgba(0 , 0 , 0 , 0.3);"]]

**Special Containment Procedures:** As of ██/██/1967, SCP-5095 been assumed to be neutralized.

**Description:** SCP-5095 is a anomalous, parasitic organism similar to other cyclophyllid cestode of the family Taeniidae. SCP-5095 only inhabits the cranial cavities of hominids, typically humans, where it will develop by attaching itself to grey matter within the organism's brain and consuming rational thought, which is converted through an anomalous process into nutritional compounds. 

SCP-5095's development occurs at a significantly slower rate than similar species; larvae may develop in excess of 30 years, during which SCP-5095's consumption will gradually impair its host's ability to perform cognitive functions, eventually resulting in brain death. Attempts to extract SCP-5095 from living hosts have thus far been unsuccessful.

Between  ██/██/1960 and  ██/██/1967, all known instances of SCP-5095 approached maturity and subsequently expired. As no further instances have been identified, 5095 has been presumed neutralized.

**Addendum 5095-1:** Discovery

The first batch of instances were discovered by Dr. Mary Eliot after a series of outbreaks in the eastern United States in 1938. In total, ██ civilians were infected with individual instances of SCP-5095 and were subsequently quarantined. As per protocol, a standard media purge was undertaken to prevent public knowledge of SCP-5095.

**Addendum 5095-2:** Infection Instances

SCP-5095's exact effects vary between individuals. The following include three cases from the initial outbreak resulting in significantly distinct symptoms. For a complete list of affected persons, see ##firebrick|5095 Cases UNA##.

> [[size 140%]]**Arnold Witts**[[/size]]

> 
> **Infection Progression:** Onset of symptoms 2 years following suspected infection. Subject's symptoms worsened over the course of 32 years, culminating in expiration on 4/10/1961. Symptoms include:
> • Amnesia

> •  Paranoia

> //Arnold was the first identified person to be infected by SCP-5095. He used to work for the Foundation, actually, and was one of my colleagues at the time. I began to suspect something was wrong when he started forgetting things, and it only got worse from there. While before, he was one of the foremost parabiologists in the entire world, within a decade, he wasn't even capable of comprehending cellular structure. — Dr. Mary Eliot//

> [[size 140%]]**Shelley Cornell**[[/size]]
> 
> **Suspected infection date:** December, 1938
> 
> **Infection Progression:** Subject was infected for over 5 years, but presented no symptoms until one week prior to expiration. Symptoms include:
> • Aggression
> • Cognitive impairment
> • Compulsiveness
> • Emotional detachment
> 
> //Shelley was described by those close to her as a gentle, loving mother, and a passionate, loyal friend. Something was "off" about her, no doubt, but she didn't collapse until a few days before she passed away. — Dr. Mary Eliot//

> [[size 140%]]**Richard Williams**[[/size]]
> 
> **Suspected infection date:** April, 1938
> 
> **Infection Progression:** Subject presented no symptoms until three months prior to expiration, 11 years after initial infection. Symptoms include:
> • Amnesia
> • Cognitive impairment
> • Elevated mood
> • Excitability
> 
> //Rick was only seven when we brought him in. He was robbed of a normal life before he'd been able to fall in love, or raise a child, or grow old and pass on in peace, even though he was practically normal until the last few weeks of his life. I watched him grow up in confinement; he was like a first child to me. — Dr. Mary Eliot//

**Addendum 5095-4:** Removal of SCP-5095
On 5/30/1949, Dr. Mary Eliot attempted to remove an SCP-5095 instance from within a live victim, Richard Williams. During the procedure, Richard Williams expired, and Dr. Eliot [DATA EXPUNGED].

//I know that data shouldn't be expunged for us, but the old files are corrupted and I'm unable to recover the full clearance files. It's also possible the O5-3 expunged this data herself. — O5-12//
[[/div]]

I speculate that O5-3 has been infected for a while due to the progression of her now noticeable symptoms. If O5-3 continues her work, at her current rate, she will completely lose control over her cognitive functions.

This message is to request your respective insights as to whether or not O5-3 is to be removed from her position.

The primary issue is that we are allowing a potentially cognitively impaired //centennial// to remain in a position of power at the Foundation. We must be vigilant, and remain at the forefront to secure, contain, and protect, and, as such, I see no choice but to finally relieve O5-3 of her duties.

There is precedence for removing an O5 from office by the principle of anomalous property alone. It is not question that an O5 with a cognitive impairment due to an anomalous infection must be removed from office.

##grey|April 12th, 2018 at 9:02 PM##

Max,

As I'm sure you know, I've been working here for quite a long time. I was here when Hoover was in office; some of the others weren't even alive then. I've spent the better half of a lifetime securing, containing, and protecting. I've been cold, when I needed to, because I told myself that I was doing this for humanity.

Well now, I'm old and tired, Max. I'd like to spend my last few years with my daughter and grandchildren, apart from the Foundation and the anomalous world. I'd like to experience the humanity that I've been protecting for so long.

Of course, I'm due to use 006 again in a few weeks, and I've decided that I don't want to keep going. I'm asking for your help to retire completely, so that my family won't be monitored by Foundation operatives twenty-four hours a week. I'm asking for your help to let me return to the normal world.

I couldn't be there for Rick. My duties will not keep me from Lucy anymore. She's grown, but I am still her mother.
