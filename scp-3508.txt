**Item #:** SCP-3508

**Object Class:** --Safe-- Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Foundation agents are to issue recalls to retail stores for stocked instances of SCP-3508. All instances of SCP-3508 must be confiscated immediately upon discovery to prevent the passage of SCP-3508 into civilian ownership. Due to the elusive nature of SCP-3508's delivery, it is currently impossible to prevent restocking of SCP-3508.

--Non-autonomous instances of SCP-3508 may be contained within standard Safe-class containment lockers. Autonomous instances may be allowed indoor roaming privileges, so long as they are accompanied by no less than 1 guard.-- No more than 1 instance is to be allowed in Foundation custody at any given time. The singular instance must be contained within a standard containment chamber without furniture or decor. Instances are to only become bonded to D-Class. Unsanctioned interaction between SCP-3508 and any other personnel will merit disciplinary measures. 

SCP-3508 may be terminated via incineration. Civilian witnesses to Protest- and Riot-level events are to be administered Class-B amnestics, and a cover story is to be issued. Witnesses and individuals involved with Star-level events are to be administered Class-D amnestics.

Foundation personnel must constantly monitor public access television networks for occurrences of Star-Level events. Any network experiencing a Star-level event must be shut down immediately via QR-9 protocols. Personnel are to locate the coordinates of the ongoing Star-level event and administer emergency medical assistance to the victim of the event, following the termination of all present instances of SCP-3508.

**Description:** SCP-3508 is the collective designation for the line of plush toys "Soft & Squishy" manufactured by the amateur entrepreneurial group, "Accelerate the Future" (ATF), and is considered to be their first endeavor. SCP-3508 may be any color combination and species of existent or nonexistent fauna, although pastel and primary colors are favored in 68% of recorded instances. To date, there have been 15,326 definitive variations in species and coloration.

SCP-3508 measure between between 38cm and 52cm. All instances share a similar stylization, including large cartoon eyes, squat proportions, jointed digits, an "ATF" satin tag, and a detailed smile. All instances are packaged identically in clear plastic boxes; box art and information is specific to each instance. The given name of the instance will be displayed in banner form on the front panel of the box, as well as at least one drawn image and a short description. All instances are advertised with the phrase "They Really Love You!®" printed across the front panel of the box.[[footnote]]SCP-3508 includes a disclaimer against bodily harm and property damage, and warning label on the bottom panel of each box. SCP-3508's anomalous properties do not become present until they are removed from their packaging.[[/footnote]]

Contained and unopened instances have included the following:
> - A //Panthera uncia// (snow leopard) plush with the displayed name "Snowshoe" and a description reading, "Snowshoe the Snow Leopard™ is the perfect puffy pal for a cold and cuddly day! Tumble through the snow and leap through the trees with the furrrostiest feline around! He'll never leave your side, even when the snow melts away!"
> 
> - A monochrome jackalope with the displayed name "Jelly Donut" and a description reading, "Jelly Donut the Jackalope™ is the coolest cryptid around! Watch as he bounces up and into your heart! Who else would be better to hunt monsters with than you and your new best friend?"
> 
> - A rainbow //Nasua narica// (coatimundi) with the displayed name "Cuddlepie" and a description reading, "Cuddlepie the Coatimundi™ is the nighttime nuisance that can wiggle his way into anyone's heart! Fill up on fruit and scarf down snacks with Cuddlepie before the morning comes, and have the best late-night lunch ever together! Take him home and feast forever!"

Upon removal of an instance of SCP-3508 from its packaging, the instance will become autonomous and assume a jubilant demeanor. The instance will behave in a childlike manner and display affection towards the individual who unpackaged it ("bonding"), henceforth referred to as SCP-3508-1.[[footnote]]SCP-3508 may refer to instances of SCP-3508-1 by any other name, including but not limited to Mommy/Daddy, Big Brother/Sister, and Best Friend.[[/footnote]] SCP-3508 display unwavering loyalty towards instances of SCP-3508-1, and will attempt to stay within <1m of them at all times. Should a bonded instance of SCP-3508-1 leave the visual proximity of SCP-3508, the instance of SCP-3508 will attempt to locate them by any means possible. SCP-3508 learn in tandem with their bonded instance of SCP-3508-1, and display levels of intelligence greater than or equal to SCP-3508-1, allowing for a more personal relationship with SCP-3508.[[footnote]]Instances of SCP-3508 that are not bonded will display cognitive levels identical to an average American 5-year-old.[[/footnote]] SCP-3508 learn at exponential rates in order to match or learn beyond the capabilities of their respective instance of SCP-3508-1. --Instances of SCP-3508 left in isolation for any period of time exceeding twelve hours will display emotional distress, followed by a state of dormancy, during which SCP-3508 will lose autonomy.--

**Addendum-01:** An instance of SCP-3508 was provided to D-18007 for testing. Prior to testing with SCP-3508, D-18007 had displayed a significantly below-average emotional capacity. Upon becoming bonded to his respective instance of SCP-3508 (SCP-3508-662), SCP-3508-662 began to engage D-18007 in simple conversation regarding his emotional wellbeing and preferred hobbies. Within 20 minutes, D-18007 reported a significant positive change in his mood as a result of SCP-3508-662.

When testing concluded, D-18007 requested to have ownership of SCP-3508-662, a request which was ultimately denied. D-18007 appeared mildly disgruntled, but showed no signs of anomalous attachment. SCP-3508-662 was witnessed to have been "whimpering" as it was recontained in its containment locker. Inaudible whispers were reported to have emanated from the row of containment lockers containing 60 instances of SCP-3508.

Dr. Winchester, the current lead researcher assigned to SCP-3508, chose to bond to an individual instance of SCP-3508 for testing purposes, henceforth referred to as SCP-3508-Prime. SCP-3508-Prime, a white //Vulpes zerda// (Fennec fox) labeled by the packaging as "Angel Cake", has been removed from its containment locker a total of twenty-six times for testing with Dr. Winchester. SCP-3508-Prime has taken to referring to Dr. Winchester by his first name, David, and has shown expertise in multiplayer video games, such as Super Smash Bros and Street Fighter. Current testing has come to a halt after Site Director Dowe's concerns regarding Dr. Winchester's attachment to SCP-3508-Prime, and SCP-3508-Prime has been stored in a containment locker.

**Addendum-02:** On 06/01/20██, twelve instances in Foundation custody regained autonomy and caused a minor containment breach following their escape from Safe-class containment lockers. All instances made a collective attempt to swarm around Dr. Winchester. SCP-3508-Prime produced a document written in pink highlighter with child-like handwriting (Document-3508-1). Soon after, all instances were escorted back to their respective containment lockers.

A mass[[footnote]]Typically 40+ instances.[[/footnote]] of SCP-3508 will gather around the perimeter of a building,[[footnote]]Buildings and organizations involved in Protest-Level events have been noted to house corporate offices, government facilities, or activities involving political affairs.[[/footnote]] commonly emerging from local residences or unpacking themselves in retail stores that receive deliveries of SCP-3508. SCP-3508 will brandish homemade posters and picket signs, the displayed messages of which often include declarations of displeasure with expectations for adult behavior, pleas to let SCP-3508 visit their respective instances of SCP-3508-1, and advocacy for the freedom of SCP-3508 and SCP-3508-1; several instances have been witnessed holding signs that display a drawn depiction or photographed image of SCP-3508-Prime. SCP-3508 will chant various phrases relating to their "cause".[[footnote]]Phrases have included "let us love", "kids forever", "play with us", "we love you", and "friends for change". [[/footnote]] It should be of note that SCP-3508 will never attack the organization by name, nor will they make slanderous accusations regarding the business's practices.

SCP-3508 will not disperse unless --met with mild hostility-- terminated. Protest-level events may escalate to Riot- or Star-level events unless dispersed within 1 hour of initial formation.

The targets of SCP-3508 deal with affairs that would not be considered engaging to a child. Protest-level events will not target locations with affairs relating to adolescents, the intellectually disabled, buildings occupied by one or more instance of SCP-3508-1, children's entertainment, or the like.

**Addendum-03:** On 06/05/20██, the Foundation was alerted to a Protest-Level event surrounding the perimeter of the office headquarters of ██████, Inc., involving 54 instances of SCP-3508. Upon arrival to the scene of the event, several instances began to throw small stones at Foundation personnel. Researcher Davis was struck once in his left eye, prompting a loud cry of pain, to which all present instances of SCP-3508 ceased activity and turned to Davis. Following 13 seconds of silence and inactivity from SCP-3508, instances collectively abandoned their picket signs and began to throw stones at personnel. Two members of Foundation personnel were escorted to a nearby hospital to be treated for soft tissue laceration, dental trauma, and corneal abrasions.

This is considered to be the first occurrence of a Riot-Level event.

[[collapsible show="+ Riot-Level Event" hide="- Access Granted"]]
Instances of SCP-3508 will stage riots between the hours of 18:00 and 02:00 in both commercial and residential areas inhabited by individuals associated with typical Protest-Level event targets. Chants commonly heard during Riot-Level events will become scattered and infrequent shouting from random instances, often coupled with violent acts. SCP-3508 have been witnessed wielding Molotov cocktails, explosives fashioned from readily-available materials, smoke grenades, and mustard gas. All Riot-Level events have resulted in states of emergency for the area in which they occur. Riot-Level events cannot be contained until all involved instances of SCP-3508 have been terminated. As of 01/13/20██, ███ individuals have been harmed during Protest-Level events.

**Addendum-04:** On 06/26/20██, an envelope addressed to the Foundation was discovered posted to the door of Site Director Dowe. The sender of the document within the envelope has yet to be identified, but personnel have attributed the document to SCP-3508-Prime. The document, henceforth designated as Document-3508-2, shows a remarkable improvement in grammatical and syntactical structure compared to Document-3508-1, despite being attributed to the same author. SCP-3508-Prime had escaped Foundation containment several days prior to the document's discovery, and the means by which it delivered the document are currently unknown.

Following the discovery of Document-3508-2, 15 Riot-Level events occurred at 7 Foundation sites, resulting in minor containment breaches and $███,███ in damages to property and person. How SCP-3508 uncovered the classified locations of Foundation sites is unknown.

> Dear Mr. Richard Dowe,
> 
> We have come to the understanding that you and your organization have been involved in the process of making big, bad grown-ups for the past century. Individuals under your employment have grown to show disinterest in their best friends, leading to our neglect and emotional distraught. Your interference has ruined the relationship of countless stuffed animals and their caretakers, and for this reason, we have no other option than to sabotage your current endeavors.

[[collapsible show="+ Star-Level Event" hide ="- Access Granted"]]
Only 5 Star-Level events have occurred to date, and have resulted in the deaths of █ individuals involved.

Instances of SCP-3508 will appear within the residence of an individual whose organization --has been-- may be sought out during Protest-Level events. Star-Level events may last between 10 minutes and 16 hours, and are carried out by anywhere between 3 and 30 instances of SCP-3508. The event will initiate with an instance of SCP-3508 activating a video camera, which will stream footage of the event to a hijacked public access television network. All documented events have shown the camera to be pointed at the victim, whom has been blindfolded and bound to a chair.[[footnote]]Methods of restraint have included rope, electrical wire, jump-rope cords, and duct tape.[[/footnote]] An instance of SCP-3508 will either initiate an interrogation process, or a torture process.

Interrogation processes often include questioning regarding the practices of the victim's organization, reasons for why the organization has been operating, knowledge regarding the effects of the organization's practices on SCP-3508, and reasons as to why the organization has begun to "interfere" with the perceived relationships of SCP-3508 and SCP-3508-1. Torture involved in interrogation processes has been limited to occurrences in which the victim does not wish to speak, or displays other forms of non-compliance. SCP-3508 will limit physical torture to mild lacerations, electrocution of an unknown voltage, and waterboarding.

Torture processes seldom include questioning beyond the rhetorical, and involve practices far more extreme than those seen in interrogation processes. Practices involved have included:
> - Removal of finger and toenails
> - Bone fracture
> - Disembowelment and force-feeding
> - Tooth extraction
> - Tickle torture
> - Hamstringing and then made to "walk"
> - Genital mutilation

These processes are carried out with no end goal for the victim other than death. As questioning is minimally involved, it is theorized that torture processes are designed to inspire fear in witnesses of the event, in order to prevent abandonment of SCP-3508 by SCP-3508-1.

The following footage was recovered from a torture process broadcast on [REDACTED] prior to Foundation interference. Video footage has been censored, and audio footage has been coupled with a transcription of events.

The victim of the event  has since been identified as Mr. Peter ██████. Mr. ██████ is the regional manager of the pharmaceutical company, "[REDACTED]". He has one daughter, age 6, whom owns no stuffed animals (SCP-3508 or otherwise) and is tutored daily in mathematics.

**Transcript:**
> //[The channel cuts to static as the camera switches on. The camera is jostled, and then sat on a flat surface. The dim light reveals a disheveled man bound to a wooden dining room chair and blindfolded. He grunts and struggles against his restraints. Giggling and high-pitched laughter is audible from numerous sources behind the camera. A single instance of SCP-3508, a mint green rabbit designated as SCP-3508-A, approaches the bound man.]//
> 
> **SCP-3508-A**: Hi, Mister ██████! Please, don't try to struggle! You're getting a time out for all the bad things you've done. Time outs are a good thing for bad people!
> 
> //[Several instances behind the camera cheer in agreement with SCP-3508-A. SCP-3508-A takes a step closer to Mr. ██████, then turns to face the camera momentarily.]//
> 
> **SCP-3508-A**: Oh, oh! Say 'hi' to all our friends out there watching on their TVs! You're gonna be super famous, Mr. ██████!
> 
> **SCP-3508-A**: Can you say hi to the camera?
> 
> //[The footage stutters. The camera shifts, revealing a number of SCP-3508, hidden mostly by the darkness. Several are wearing strips of cloth tied around their mouths, appendages, and bodies. A glint of metal is visible just beyond the instances. The instances say 'hello' to the camera, as instructed. The camera swivels back to its original position. Mr. ██████'s breathing has quieted, and he has become still.]//
> 
> **SCP-3508-A**: Me and my friends know that you've been trying real hard to take us away from our mommies, and our daddies, and our super duper bestest friends! You make 'em think they gots to grow up, and then be a big ol' stinky adult, and leave us at home!
> 
> //[The murmuring of one instance is audible. SCP-3508-A lowers its voice to a stage whisper as it creeps closer to Mr. ██████, staring up at him.]//
> 
> **SCP-3508-A**: Because of you, now they get bored of us real quick and put us in the attic. And we wait there. We wait for a long time.
> 
> //[The footage stutters once more. SCP-3508-A raises its voice.]//
> 
> **SCP-3508-A**: Do you know what it's like to wait for a long time? Say, 'really bad!'
> 
> //[Instances of SCP-3508 chime in, all crying 'really bad' from different locations behind the camera. SCP-3508-A pauses, turns to the camera, smiles, and waves. It turns back to Mr. ██████, and climbs up onto his lap.]//
> 
> **SCP-3508-A**: That's why we came right here to your house so we can play with you!
> 
> //[An instance of SCP-3508 scuttles onscreen to offer an unidentified tool to SCP-3508-A. SCP-3508-A takes it in both hands and settles it on the left index and middle fingers of Mr. ██████.]//
> 
> **SCP-3508-A**: Okay, here goes!
> 
> //[There is a distinct crunching as the tool severs Mr. ██████'s index finger, and Mr. ██████ lurches forward as he cries out. One bloody finger falls to the ground in view of the camera. SCP-3508-A situates the tool against his middle finger again, opening and closing it to show that the finger is still halfway intact at the bone. It clamps the tool down again, this time successfully. Squelching is audible as SCP-3508-A drives a pointed piece of the tool into the open stumps of Mr. ██████'s hand. It smiles up at him with childlike innocence.]//
> 
> **SCP-3508-A**: You can cry, Mister! It makes the boo-boos feel all better! Do you wanna say 'sorry' for making us wait a big, long time? Say, 'sorry!'
> 
> //[Mr. ██████ writhes in agony in his seat. SCP-3508-A moves to stand on the arm of his chair as it pokes his cheek with one soiled arm.]//
> 
> **SCP-3508-A**: 'Sorry!'
> 
> //[Mr. ██████ drops his chin and retches into his lap. Bile splashes onto the chest of SCP-3508, who grins widely down at the stains.]//
> 
> **SCP-3508-A**: Where is your heart, Mister? Do bad grown-ups even have one?
> 
> //[SCP-3508-A looks back behind the camera, and begins to giggle. The grinding of metal fills the room as a number of instances raise a circular saw to the level of the arm chair. Mr. ██████ shrieks as the saw begins to spin and emit a deafening grinding noise. The instances of SCP-3508 push the circular saw closer, mere inches at a time. The edge of the circular saw tears into the folds of his shirt and shreds the fabric with ease. The video persists just until the circular saw reaches the stomach of Mr. ██████. The screen cuts to an emergency broadcast notice, and an alarm sounds.]//
> 
> **Emergency broadcast announcer**: This is your emergency alert system. This message was transmitted by request of --
