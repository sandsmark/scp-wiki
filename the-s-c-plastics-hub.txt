title:S & C Plastics Hub
Right, I've put this off for long enough. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the official hub page of the S & C Plastics Canon, created by Djoric and continued by Ihpkmn. 
[[size 0%]] Story Time! [[/size]]
++ The Setting:
[[size 0%]] There once were two men, a Sissy and a Sloth. [[/size]]
**Sloth's Pit, Wisconsin:** Sloth's Pit, AKA Sloth Spit AKA Backwoods AKA You're Never Leaving Here, is located in the northern part of the state of Wisconsin, in Douglas County, right on the border with Minnesota. Sloth's Pit is named for it's founder, Jackson Sloth, who originally named the town "New Toronto". However, it was renamed after a giant sinkhole opened under Sloth's manor in 1890, the first of many odd occurrences in the town of Sloth's Pit. Weird things happen in this town, like they happen in all small towns. Why?
[[size 0%]] Sissy raised the Sloth, taught him how to tell stories. [[/size]]
Because Sloth's Pit is a...
[[size 0%]] Sloth grew up and stabbed Sissy in the back. His stories hurt Sissy, hurt him so much. [[/size]]
**Nexus:** A nexus is a point where a large amount of anomalous activity occurs, and Sloth's Pit is one of known twenty-three nexus zones in the USA, most of which have a Foundation site located locally. Enough weird shit happens in these places to make Twin Peaks seem boring by comparison. No matter what happens, there are always laws to nexuses:[[footnote]] Is it Nexuses or Nexii?[[/footnote]]
[[size 0%]]Sissy grew to hate Sloth, but Sloth still loved Sissy. (not that way. perv.)[[/size]]
# No matter what, a nexus is like Vegas: what happens there stays there. No anomalous event that occur in a nexus zone ever leaves. Likewise, the outside world will be largely ignorant of what happens in the nexus.
# The population never notices, or if it does, it really doesn't give a shit. This is a large boon to the Foundation, as amnestics require no administration, unless it's tourist season.
# There are no rules. If it's weird, it's gonna happen. 
[[size 0%]]Sissy decided to tell one last story, one that would ruin Sloth. Then Sloth said "sorry".[[/size]]
This particular nexus zone is home to dear old...
[[size 0%]] But the story was already told. Sloth and Sissy both died. But...[[/size]]
**Site 87:** Codenamed S & C Plastics, Site 87 is a site for SCP Objects not yet made SCP Objects. Termed E-Class Objects, these items, beasts and beings have yet to have official SCP Reports written about them, and may just end up relegated to the log of anomalous items if they don't prove to be SCP-worthy.
[[size 0%]] New stories were told because of their deaths. This story doesn't have a happy ending...[[/size]]
Site 87 is home to one of the largest and most advanced Department of Multiuniversal Affairs in the Foundation, which is facilitated by the fact that space and time tend to be less stable in a nexus than elsewhere. For more information on the Department of Multiuniversal Affairs, please see the transcript of Dr. Tristan Bailey's orientation, [[[Multi-U 101]]]. 
[[size 0%]] Because it hasn't ended yet. [[/size]]
Site 87 was established after what has become known as the Camp Krakkow incident, or the Great Fuck-Up of 1976. During this, a joint GOC-Foundation raid was conducted on a summer camp in an attempt to recover an SCP object that was deemed dangerous. This object, sadly, was all that was keeping the camp from being destroyed by an unknown entity or entities; upon removal from the camp, Camp Krakkow's entire population was killed in a single night. 
[[size 0%]] You're telling it. [[/size]]
Site 87 was started in the nearby town of Sloth's Pit in an attempt to contain the anomaly at the camp, but it was quickly discovered that Camp Krakkow wasn't the only weird thing that was going on in this podunk community. Soon, a Site that was barely 100 people expanded into the several thousand staff members that run it today.

++ What to remember if you write for this canon:

# **This is not Site 19:** The people at S & C Plastics are just regular folks, trying to make their way in the insanity that is the Foundation. You likely won't find any reality benders, immortals, or people who can control butterflies with a Nikon working on the staff here. They may be in containment, but that's about it.
# **The Foundation Fucks Up:** The Foundation is not infallible, and it never was, as the Great Fuck-Up of 1976 demonstrates.  S & C Plastics was established in an attempt to make the Foundation more patient an analyze phenomena more closely before moving in to secure them. 
# **There are no SCPs at Site 87:** More likely than not, most of the items featured in S & C Plastics tales are never going to be made into actual SCPs, because anomalous activity that occurs in a nexus cannot leave a nexus. You pretty much have free reign with whatever anomalous stuff you want to insert into a story. Want a reality bender who's only power is turning blood into strawberry jam? Go ahead. Anamalous Anart Anthrocon in Space? Write it. A Liopleurodon[[footnote]] A Maaaaaagical Liopleurodon, Charlie![[/footnote]] suddenly appearing in the river? Do it. Just follow the same rule of thumb as you would writing any normal SCP: make it interesting. 
# **The Tone:** The tone of this canon is, as Djoric put it, "A bit closer to Gravity Falls or Hellboy than Delta Green. Humor is fine, drama is fine, horror is fine." This canon is slice of life more than anything; for anime fans, think more Azumanga Daioh, less Hellsing. If you want to write a romance, write a romance. If you want to write horror, write horror. If you want comedy, write it.
