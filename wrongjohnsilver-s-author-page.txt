Hello! Wrong John Silver here. Welcome to my author page! Over time I'll be adding thoughts about how to write, perhaps some info about recurring characters and themes, philosophy behind my stories, and I'll answer any questions you may have about pretty much anything. You can see whatever I'm presently working on in my [*http://scpsandbox2.wikidot.com/wrongjohnsilver sandbox page]. Feel free to let me know your thoughts!

I entered a collection of 5 entries into the [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/experiment-log-261-ad-de SCP-261 Experiment Log]. Pocari Sweat, Chocolate Twinkies, Mystery Flavor Butterfinger BBs, LanuGoGoGo!, and Shakespeare's Scrumptious Sonnets. This was purely for fun. The idea behind LanuGoGoGo! comes from [*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanugo lanugo].

I added the entries for 2282 and the OTT 2123 entry to the [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2305-collab SCP-2305 Extended Documentation]. It's a great way to let your inner troll out safely. And just gathering all the space-based SCPs to just attack at once and fall into a cosmic-scale ball of FAIL was too tantalizing to resist.

I added a perfectly normal feather to the [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/log-of-anomalous-items Log of Anomalous Items]. It's a great place for the fridge-horror vignette along the lines of "For Sale: Baby shoes. Never worn." type. Some people ask what kind of bird it is. I ask why haven't we ever seen it before.

[[tab SCP-2289: The Devil's Eyes]]
[[[SCP-2289]]] was my first SCP (although my first submission was a tale, see below). In this one, I observed that Devil Facial Tumor Disease, a [*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil_facial_tumour_disease real thing], hadn't made an appearance in the SCP files. And, well, it had to. I started imagining it with eyes... and it grew into a little body horror vignette. But it wouldn't have worked without the interview. Just the idea of breathing a bunch of character into a D-class, someone we usually just forget about, was what made it work, I think (but feel free to tell me otherwise).

[[tab SCP-2460: Dark Satellite]]
[[[SCP-2460]]] went from concept to post in about a week. Sometimes, you get struck by an idea, and you start connecting one thought to the next and realize just how it all has to meld together. Here, I thought, when we talk about phasing through walls, we talk about one thing phasing through one other thing. Why not have three things phase through each other? Four? A hundred? A thousand? I just followed the logic from there, and ended up realizing I was describing [*http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/dark-matter-may-feel-a-dark-force-that-the-rest-of-the-universe-does-not1/ dark matter]. And dang, do I love putting it all together... The QK-Class Quantum Degeneracy scenario I made because matter failing to act the way we need it to act was not really well represented by other choices. (And I got away with using the word "quantum" in a skip.)

[[tab SCP-2203: Find the One for You!]]
[[[SCP-2203]]] comes from my own experiences with love. I was thinking about the whole ideal in Western culture that we're all fed when we're young: all we need to do is fine The One for us, and we'll live happily ever after. The corollary is that if you aren't happy, you haven't found your One yet. Well, that's just nonsense. So, let's just lampshade that lie and make a thing that just up and tells you who your best fit, the person you'd be happiest with, would be. SCP-2203 is harmless. Completely harmless, even strictly beneficial. It can still ruin your life.
I'm so very thankful for seeing how popular this entry has become, with entries now on YouTube, and even a T-shirt! I love you all! (But I only receive one card, so most of you will have to go without.)

[[tab SCP-128: Kinetic Energy Entity]]
[[[SCP-128]]]... I actually have some nostalgia here. I scared myself silly a long time ago when I stumbled across this website (I have no idea how... this was 2009-2010, I think). But I remember browsing the few entries there were, and read up on the Kinetic Energy Entity. (Hey, I'm big into science, how could I not?) It was one of the articles that stuck with me in the back of my head. Fast forward to today, and suddenly, it needs a rewrite, and I suddenly imagine it as a hamster (not sure why). So, I rewrite the entry. I'm happy to have a chance to help out a classic article.

[[tab SCP-2458: Music Hath Charms]]
[[[SCP-2458]]] started out as an idea for a canon I'm developing: [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-1264304/new-canon-idea:on-mount-golgotha On Mount Golgotha], tales and SCPs revolving around what [[[SCP-012]]] fully represents. I originally thought I wasn't going to submit to the [[[Short Works Contest]]], but then realized that this idea for a cello worked better as a short work. Start with something that makes you groove to the beat... but then realize that it's actually coded for lots of movements, once you throw out musicality. If only there was a non-musical score somewhere...

[[tab SCP-2459: When the Traffic Clears]]
[[[SCP-2459]]] first was a reference to a gigantic traffic jam in China that supposedly was going to take days to clear. It cleared within the first day, but I thought, what if it didn't? What would it take to make everyone stay in traffic? And then I saw the parallels between everyone waiting in traffic like they're supposed to, and everyone staying in their places in society, even though no one wanted to be there, doing that. I can't speak for what everyone else thinks, but for me, the situation is creepy because it falls in the uncanny valley of behavior. What everyone is doing is preposterous, but when you hear why, when you see their arguments, you can't help but understand where they're coming from. They aren't crazy. They're normal. And that's when you look around your home, your obligations, your hopes and dreams, and realize, maybe you're stuck in the traffic jam, too.

[[tab It's Just a Dream]]
[[[It's Just A Dream]]] was my entry into the 2015 Reimagining Contest. This was the first thing I posted on the site, and I was compelled to write about [[[SCP-209]]]. The horror that item makes for me was that it makes the drinker comfortable with torturing someone to death. But then I realized that we're all comfortable with horrible, bizarre brutality when we dream. And thus, it was born.

One of these days, I want to write a sequel, where the junior researcher realizes that SCP-209 isn't a dream machine, but a glass of scotch after all...

[[tab 100 Feet of ROPE!/Twisted Together]]
[[[100 Feet of ROPE!]]] and [[[Twisted Together]]] is an experiment for me. I'm writing a series in snippets, flashes, moments of time filled with thought and emotion. No, it's not for everyone. I'm aware of that. I might rejigger things at a later date. But I have to try different things whenever possible.

[[tab The Journal of K. M. Sandoval]]
[[[The Journal of K. M. Sandoval]]] is a collaboration with [[*user LadyKatie]] and the start of a new canon, //On Mount Golgotha//. Mainly meant as a set piece and introduction, it's to tell us what [[[SCP-012]]] is about. [[[SCP-2458]]] is a part of it, and now I'm working on pulling together the resources for more. It will grow slowly, but the story will grow deeper. Finding out about the 1966 Florence floods was key, and afforded lots of excellent photos regarding what happened.

[[tab Funerals Are Fun]]
> You effectively turn [[[SCP-2030]]] into a sort of hero here. A weird, creepy, disgusting, homicidal, hilarious hero.
> 
> [[*user Abettik]]
So [[*user Dexanote]] posted a [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-1468460/dexanote-s-challenge challenge] in which two SCPs fight each other, with the story narrated by a civilian. So, my mind immediately went to uncontained skips, and I suddenly envisioned [[[SCP-2852]]] and [[[SCP-2030]]] duking it out. The big thing about the two is that they both try to influence people, make them comfortable with body horror, and disappear them afterwards, so they very easily could step on each other's turf. My mind, which may or may not have been addled by prescription cough syrup at the time, insisted on making it a funeral gone wrong. 

Inspired, I sat down and put everything together in a fast-paced, down-home, manner. I wrote it out as it played in my mind in an hour or two. I knew that if I slept on it, I'd question it. So, I quickly submitted it for draft review. My answer back was best expressed by [[*user DreamwalkerFae]]:

> Did you…
> 
> Did you just…
> 
> I'm done.

I posted the thing. It took off.

Looking back, I realize that this tale represents a growth in my writing since I started. It's got the vividly disturbing imagery of [[[It's Just A Dream]]]. It has [[[SCP-128]]]'s madcap hilarity. The show-don't-tell character development of [[[SCP-2289]]] appears. It's got the sucker-punch-to-the-gut feel of [[[100 Feet of ROPE!]]]. The perfectly-rational explanation of fiercely anomalous conditions of [[[SCP-2459]]]. The outrageous [*http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation serial escalation] of anomalies from the [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2305-collab SCP-2305 Extended Documentation]. And all in 879 words. I can't touch that.

Also, this tale marks the first time we get to hear Cousin Johnny's voice. The eulogy was the hardest part to put together. SCP-2852 said that Cousin Johnny speaks in word salad. Well, we've got one word salad in [[[SCP-1981]]], but I wanted to make sure it didn't sound like that. After all, Ronald Reagan was the leader of the free world, but Cousin Johnny is family. So, his eulogy needed a more casual, familiar feel. I didn't want the ineffable doom-and-gloom of 1981. It still needed to be grim nonsense, but homey grim nonsense. I spoke with 2852's author, [[*user kinchtheknifeblade]] afterward, and he gave me the thumbs up on my portrayal of the petulant, attention-grabbing Cousin Johnny. 

Writing it was fun. I should do it more often.
