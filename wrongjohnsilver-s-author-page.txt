Hello! Wrong John Silver here. Welcome to my author page! Over time I'll be adding thoughts about how to write, perhaps some info about recurring characters and themes, philosophy behind my stories, and I'll answer any questions you may have about pretty much anything. You can see whatever I'm presently working on in my [*http://scpsandbox2.wikidot.com/wrongjohnsilver sandbox page]. Feel free to let me know your thoughts!

I entered a collection of 5 entries into the [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/experiment-log-261-ad-de SCP-261 Experiment Log]. Pocari Sweat, Chocolate Twinkies, Mystery Flavor Butterfinger BBs, LanuGoGoGo!, and Shakespeare's Scrumptious Sonnets. This was purely for fun. The idea behind LanuGoGoGo! comes from [*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanugo lanugo].

I added the entries for 2282 and the OTT 2123 entry to the [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2305-collab SCP-2305 Extended Documentation]. It's a great way to let your inner troll out safely. And just gathering all the space-based SCPs to just attack at once and fall into a cosmic-scale ball of FAIL was too tantalizing to resist.

I added a perfectly normal feather to the [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/log-of-anomalous-items Log of Anomalous Items]. It's a great place for the fridge-horror vignette along the lines of "For Sale: Baby shoes. Never worn." type. Some people ask what kind of bird it is. I ask why haven't we ever seen it before.

[[tab SCP-2289: The Devil's Eyes]]
[[[SCP-2289]]] was my first SCP (although my first submission was a tale, see below). In this one, I observed that Devil Facial Tumor Disease, a [*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil_facial_tumour_disease real thing], hadn't made an appearance in the SCP files. And, well, it had to. I started imagining it with eyes... and it grew into a little body horror vignette. But it wouldn't have worked without the interview. Just the idea of breathing a bunch of character into a D-class, someone we usually just forget about, was what made it work, I think (but feel free to tell me otherwise).

[[tab SCP-2460: Dark Satellite]]
[[[SCP-2460]]] went from concept to post in about a week. Sometimes, you get struck by an idea, and you start connecting one thought to the next and realize just how it all has to meld together. Here, I thought, when we talk about phasing through walls, we talk about one thing phasing through one other thing. Why not have three things phase through each other? Four? A hundred? A thousand? I just followed the logic from there, and ended up realizing I was describing [*http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/dark-matter-may-feel-a-dark-force-that-the-rest-of-the-universe-does-not1/ dark matter]. And dang, do I love putting it all together... The QK-Class Quantum Degeneracy scenario I made because matter failing to act the way we need it to act was not really well represented by other choices. (And I got away with using the word "quantum" in a skip.)

[[tab SCP-2203: Find the One for You!]]
[[[SCP-2203]]] comes from my own experiences with love. I was thinking about the whole ideal in Western culture that we're all fed when we're young: all we need to do is fine The One for us, and we'll live happily ever after. The corollary is that if you aren't happy, you haven't found your One yet. Well, that's just nonsense. So, let's just lampshade that lie and make a thing that just up and tells you who your best fit, the person you'd be happiest with, would be. 

Although [[[SCP-2460]]] is still my top-ranked SCP (which I agree for good reason), SCP-2203 is without a doubt my most popular SCP. It's been read on YouTube. There's a T-shirt that references it. I love you all! (But I only receive one card, so most of you will have to go without.)

The YouTube comments make clear some of the issues with SCP-2203. Many, many people want to use it. But... what if your perfect match is on another continent? What if your perfect match has another partner already? What if multiple people get the same perfect person? And even if you know who it is, what if you screw up meeting them? GemoDawn is so torn between liking it and not liking it, that she ends up repeating herself at the end of the video. That's what I was hoping for. I want part of you saying "WANT!" and part of you saying, "DO NOT WANT!" so you're left saying, "DON'T KNOW IF WANT!"

SCP-2203 is harmless. It can still ruin your life.

[[tab SCP-128: Kinetic Energy Entity]]
[[[SCP-128]]]... I actually have some nostalgia here. I scared myself silly a long time ago when I stumbled across this website (I have no idea how... this was 2009-2010, I think). But I remember browsing the few entries there were, and read up on the Kinetic Energy Entity. (Hey, I'm big into science, how could I not?) It was one of the articles that stuck with me in the back of my head. Fast forward to today, and suddenly, it needs a rewrite, and I suddenly imagine it as a hamster (not sure why). So, I rewrite the entry. I'm happy to have a chance to help out a classic article.

[[tab SCP-2458: Music Hath Charms]]
[[[SCP-2458]]] started out as an idea for a canon I'm developing: [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-1264304/new-canon-idea:on-mount-golgotha On Mount Golgotha], tales and SCPs revolving around what [[[SCP-012]]] fully represents. I originally thought I wasn't going to submit to the [[[Short Works Contest]]], but then realized that this idea for a cello worked better as a short work. Start with something that makes you groove to the beat... but then realize that it's actually coded for lots of movements, once you throw out musicality. If only there was a non-musical score somewhere...

[[tab SCP-2459: When the Traffic Clears]]
I first envisioned [[[SCP-2459]]] when I heard about a gigantic traffic jam in China that supposedly was going to take days to clear. It cleared within the first day, but I thought, what if it didn't? What would it take to make everyone stay in traffic? And then I saw the parallels between everyone waiting in traffic like they're supposed to, and everyone staying in their places in society, even though no one wanted to be there, doing that. 

So, it originally was going to be in China, but then I read about [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-1378332 MrWrong's Fill Up the Map Challenge] and noticed that all of Pakistan was empty. Nearly 200 million people live in Pakistan. There's no way it's empty. So, I moved it to Pakistan. Turned out it was easier to find super-chaotic traffic jam pictures from Pakistan anyway. 

I greatly enjoyed reading reactions to it. A few people said, why don't we know where it comes from? What if this spreads to other places? I took those concerns as proof that the whole idea that this is really a statement about the human condition is working. I can't speak for what everyone else thinks, but for me, the situation is creepy because it falls in the uncanny valley of behavior. What everyone is doing is preposterous, but when you hear why, when you see their arguments, you can't help but understand where they're coming from. They aren't crazy. They're normal. And that's when you look around your home, your obligations, your hopes and dreams, and realize...

[[tab It's Just a Dream]]
[[[It's Just A Dream]]] was my entry into the 2015 Reimagining Contest. This was the first thing I posted on the site, and I was compelled to write about [[[SCP-209]]]. The horror that item makes for me was that it makes the drinker comfortable with torturing someone to death. But then I realized that we're all comfortable with horrible, bizarre brutality when we dream. And thus, it was born.

The dreams were designed with the philosophy that the relation between things had to be more based on feelings, on thoughts echoing in your head. 

**Collegiate Chess:** As a first dream, I figured making things more opulent would make things feel more normal. My college campus is still a common dream location for me, and I find it easier to navigate. 
* The Butler: First thing to notice is that each dream has three main characters: The dreamer, the victim, and the host. The Butler is the host for this one. He's simply described, very stereotypical, because he's what you'd think you'd see in a beautifully appointed room. 
* The Scotch: The more obvious connection to the original [[[SCP-209]]].
* Chess: A game of intellectuals. This is a place for smart, successful people, and so must the game be as well.
* The Shrinking Cage: Restriction is a common theme in my own dreams. Also, in the few times my violence proves successful in my dreams, I'm literally crushing my opposition. I have at times caught an enemy's head in a cage or metal box and squeezed.
* Cat transformation: As something becomes more annoying in my dreams, it gets less humanlike. Also, dimensions don't really matter; things are as large or as small as they need to be.
* Every Three Seconds: Every dream included this detail. There have been a few times while I dream that I'll hear some annoying sound go off rhythmically, and no matter how much I run around and try to stop it, it's still there. Normally, when I wake up, I realize: it's my breathing I was hearing.
* The Quad: A bit of reward, shift to a prettier, more open place. Serenity, success, everyone loves your successes.

**Romance Is Frowned Upon:** A take on a sex dream without making it a sex dream. Also, I wanted the world to reflect the D-class's inner turmoil over falling in love with someone when they aren't supposed to. The Foundation is portrayed as a monolithic, faceless enemy here, leading to a chase dream and a paradise-lost environment.
* The Bed: They know what they want. Where else would they start?
* We can do whatever we want: Like I said, the horror of 209 is that "doing anything" becomes okay.
* [*http://41.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ldy3vv2riX1qfhbkko1_1280.jpg Kermit the Forg]: The host. Names and everything get jumbled up. He can't be that one character you love and trust. But he's the symbol of doing everything the way you're supposed to.
* Paintball! Painball! Payball!: Haven't you noticed that something keeps repeating itself in a dream when there are more connections to your situation to be made?
* The Abandoned Factory: Another one of my dream locations. Everything giant rusted pipes, gears, and catwalks. 
* Romance is frowned upon: I once had a dream that had a theme. The theme appeared everywhere; spoken by gurus, written on newspapers, on banners hanging from lampposts, everywhere.
* The Heartbreakers: The Foundation is the enemy that is keeping you from loving. Don't do the do.
* I hate whiskey!: I wanted this to feel terribly tragic in retrospect. This was about the anomaly's mechanics, not dreams.
* Suburban Kitchen: Paradise. The life he could only dream of.
* White Picket Fence: There's always a limit to your freedom. Also, where it stands depends on what you think you can get away with. Finally, whenever you see a thing through the window in a dream, soon enough that thing is in the room with you.
* My Name Is D: During the first part of the dream, it was both of their dream. Now, it's only his. He doesn't know the name, so there's nothing to learn.
* The D Dance: Again, something going on longer than it should. All based around what he's thinking.
* The Cake: You don't pull a fully frosted cake out of the oven. You just feel like you do.
* Attacking With The D: He finally takes control of the situation and declares the situation his. The thing that holds him down becomes his weapon.
* She Is Cake: Do I need to explain this?

**SCP-6823110-Montauk:** This one borrowed the most heavily from my own dreams. Here we also see what happens when two separate people fear very different things.
* Cthulhu In The Toilet: The host. I had this dream. A great fear, the worst imaginable being, and my brain worked to put him in the basest, most loathsome place it could think of. In the toilet. Also, it's a counterpoint for the veteran researcher's fear vs. the newbie. The veteran fears SCP-6823110-Montauk. The newbie fears Cthulhu In The Toilet.
* SCP-6823110-Montauk: A portmanteau with 682, 231, and 110-Montauk, of course. Continuing the theme of making something longer than it has any reason to be, the designation essentially means SCP-BADBADBAD.
* The Containment Chamber: Well, the worst containment chamber for the worst entity would have to be in the most loathsome place, right? The public restroom.
* The Medical Table: Here we see the result of clashing fears. The newbie has no clue what she's supposed to fear, and so sees nothing. 
* The Four Monsters: Partly the result of 6823110-Montauk, partly because... I dreamed them. I was in the Abandoned Factory, and heard this horrible screeching sound, like the tearing of metal, that didn't stop. I found a door, and knew that the monster was on the other side of the door. I opened the door, saw the monster, and screamed in terror. The monster, looking like a humanoid with octopus arms on its head and huge, red eyes, and, yes, wearing overalls, stopped sawing through the sheet metal he was working on, and screamed in terror right back. I kept the overalls. Nice secondary Deliverance touch.
* The Insect-Covered Towel: Another dream of mine. It took something that was ostensibly clean and made it filthier and filthier over time.
* Final note: What was the Containment Chamber actually trying to contain?

**Presidential Debate:** If you had to explain a Presidential debate to a three-year-old, what would you say? What would be understood? Something like, "The two people have to answer questions, and whoever --does the best job answering them-- gets the most questions right --can enjoy greater popular support-- wins the race for President."
* The Moderator: This dream's host. More central, more directing, more aware.
* The Questions: All horribly leading. Agent Washington's are simpler, as he's mainly just enjoying the dream. Dr. Minh is worried about how the dreams work, so his are more about the dream itself.
* Ohio, Puerto Rico, Uganda, and [REDACTED]: List is longer and increasingly nonsensical, just like what I encounter. The [REDACTED] is there to set up the [DATA EXPUNGED] later; Agent Washington is used to it in his line of work.
* The Electrical Vote: When I was three, I thought it was the electrical vote.
* Fireworks and Pose: Yeah, a Great Gatsby screenshot moment. Perfect for victory.
* Stolen Shoelaces: When I started saying I was going to work on The Sadist's Tumbler, I got a lot of people saying I should work on The Sadist's Tumblr. So, I threw in the Tumblr reference. (I can bury a reference. Heck, I bury references to lots of other skips in my other work.)
* The Oval Podium: The Oval Office has ovals everywhere. More Presidential that way. (What button would you press?)
* [DOCTOR EXPIGGED]: Words never stay the same in dreams. They're always about what you're thinking that moment.

One of these days, I want to write a sequel, where the junior researcher realizes that SCP-209 isn't a dream machine, but a glass of scotch after all...

[[tab 100 Feet of ROPE!/Twisted Together]]
[[[100 Feet of ROPE!]]] and [[[Twisted Together]]] is an experiment for me. I'm writing a series in snippets, flashes, moments of time filled with thought and emotion. No, it's not for everyone. I'm aware of that. I might rejigger things at a later date. But I have to try different things whenever possible.

[[tab The Journal of K. M. Sandoval]]
[[[The Journal of K. M. Sandoval]]] is a collaboration with [[*user LadyKatie]] and the start of a new canon, //On Mount Golgotha//. Mainly meant as a set piece and introduction, it's to tell us what [[[SCP-012]]] is about. [[[SCP-2458]]] is a part of it, and now I'm working on pulling together the resources for more. It will grow slowly, but the story will grow deeper. Finding out about the 1966 Florence floods was key, and afforded lots of excellent photos regarding what happened.

[[tab Funerals Are Fun]]
> You effectively turn [[[SCP-2030]]] into a sort of hero here. A weird, creepy, disgusting, homicidal, hilarious hero.
> 
> [[*user Abettik]]
So [[*user Dexanote]] posted a [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-1468460/dexanote-s-challenge challenge] in which two SCPs fight each other, with the story narrated by a civilian. So, my mind immediately went to uncontained skips, and I suddenly envisioned [[[SCP-2852]]] and [[[SCP-2030]]] duking it out. The big thing about the two is that they both try to influence people, make them comfortable with body horror, and disappear them afterwards, so they very easily could step on each other's turf. My mind, which may or may not have been addled by prescription cough syrup at the time, insisted on making it a funeral gone wrong. 

Inspired, I sat down and put everything together in a fast-paced, down-home, manner. I wrote it out as it played in my mind in an hour or two. I knew that if I slept on it, I'd question it. So, I quickly submitted it for draft review. My answer back was best expressed by [[*user HotCocoaNerd]]:

> Did you…
> 
> Did you just…
> 
> I'm done.

I posted the thing. It took off.

Looking back, I realize that this tale represents a growth in my writing since I started. It's got the vividly disturbing imagery of [[[It's Just A Dream]]]. It has [[[SCP-128]]]'s madcap hilarity. The show-don't-tell character development of [[[SCP-2289]]] appears. It's got the sucker-punch-to-the-gut feel of [[[100 Feet of ROPE!]]]. The perfectly-rational explanation of fiercely anomalous conditions of [[[SCP-2459]]]. The outrageous [*http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation serial escalation] of anomalies from the [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2305-collab SCP-2305 Extended Documentation]. And all in 879 words. I can't touch that.

Also, this tale marks the first time we get to hear Cousin Johnny's voice. The eulogy was the hardest part to put together. SCP-2852 said that Cousin Johnny speaks in word salad. Well, we've got one word salad in [[[SCP-1981]]], but I wanted to make sure it didn't sound like that. After all, Ronald Reagan was the leader of the free world, but Cousin Johnny is family. So, his eulogy needed a more casual, familiar feel. I didn't want the ineffable doom-and-gloom of 1981. It still needed to be grim nonsense, but homey grim nonsense. I spoke with 2852's author, [[*user kinchtheknifeblade]] afterward, and she gave me the thumbs up on my portrayal of the petulant, attention-grabbing Cousin Johnny. 

Writing it was fun. I should do it more often.
