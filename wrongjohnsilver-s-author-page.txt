Hello! Wrong John Silver here. Welcome to my author page! Over time I'll be adding thoughts about how to write, perhaps some info about recurring characters and themes, philosophy behind my stories, and I'll answer any questions you may have about pretty much anything. 

Here are the SCP articles I've authored:

Here are the tales I've written:
