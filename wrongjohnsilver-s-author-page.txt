Hello! Wrong John Silver here. Welcome to my author page! Over time I'll be adding thoughts about how to write, perhaps some info about recurring characters and themes, philosophy behind my stories, and I'll answer any questions you may have about pretty much anything. You can see whatever I'm presently working on in my [*http://scpsandbox2.wikidot.com/wrongjohnsilver sandbox page]. Feel free to let me know your thoughts!

**The Devils' Eyes:** [[[SCP-2289]]] was my first SCP (although my first submission was a tale, see below). In this one, I observed that Devil Facial Tumor Disease, a [*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil_facial_tumour_disease real thing], hadn't made an appearance in the SCP files. And, well, it had to. I started imagining it with eyes... and it grew into a little body horror vignette. But it wouldn't have worked without the interview. Just the idea of breathing a bunch of character into a D-class, someone we usually just forget about, was what made it work, I think (but feel free to tell me otherwise).

**Dark Satellite:** [[[SCP-2460]]] went from concept to post in about a week. Sometimes, you get struck by an idea, and you start connecting one thought to the next and realize just how it all has to meld together. Here, I thought, when we talk about phasing through walls, we talk about one thing phasing through one other thing. Why not have three things phase through each other? Four? A hundred? A thousand? I just followed the logic from there, and ended up realizing I was describing [*http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/dark-matter-may-feel-a-dark-force-that-the-rest-of-the-universe-does-not1/ dark matter]. And dang, do I love putting it all together... The QK-Class Quantum Degeneracy scenario I made because matter failing to act the way we need it to act was not really well represented by other choices. (And I got away with using the word "quantum" in a skip.)

**Find the One for You!:** [[[SCP-2203]]] comes from my own experiences with love. I was thinking about the whole ideal in Western culture that we're all fed when we're young: all we need to do is fine The One for us, and we'll live happily ever after. The corollary is that if you aren't happy, you haven't found your One yet. Well, that's just nonsense. So, let's just lampshade that lie and make a thing that just up and tells you who your best fit, the person you'd be happiest with, would be. SCP-2203 is harmless. Completely harmless, even strictly beneficial. It can still ruin your life.
I'm so very thankful for seeing how popular this entry has become, with entries now on YouTube, and even a T-shirt! I love you all! (But I only receive one card, so most of you will have to go without.)

**Kinetic Energy Entity:** [[[SCP-128]]]... I actually have some nostalgia here. I scared myself silly a long time ago when I stumbled across this website (I have no idea how... this was 2009-2010, I think). But I remember browsing the few entries there were, and read up on the Kinetic Energy Entity. (Hey, I'm big into science, how could I not?) It was one of the articles that stuck with me in the back of my head. Fast forward to today, and suddenly, it needs a rewrite, and I suddenly imagine it as a hamster (not sure why). So, I rewrite the entry. I'm happy to have a chance to help out a classic article.

**Music Hath Charms:** [[[SCP-2458]]] started out as an idea for a canon I'm developing: [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-1264304/new-canon-idea:on-mount-golgotha On Mount Golgotha], tales and SCPs revolving around what [[[SCP-012]]] fully represents. I originally thought I wasn't going to submit to the [[[Short Works Contest]]], but then realized that this idea for a cello worked better as a short work. Start with something that makes you groove to the beat... but then realize that it's actually coded for lots of movements, once you throw out musicality. If only there was a non-musical score somewhere...

**When the Traffic Clears:** [[[SCP-2459]]] first was a reference to a gigantic traffic jam in China that supposedly was going to take days to clear. It cleared within the first day, but I thought, what if it didn't? What would it take to make everyone stay in traffic? And then I saw the parallels between everyone waiting in traffic like they're supposed to, and everyone staying in their places in society, even though no one wanted to be there, doing that. I can't speak for what everyone else thinks, but for me, the situation is creepy because it falls in the uncanny valley of behavior. What everyone is doing is preposterous, but when you hear why, when you see their arguments, you can't help but understand where they're coming from. They aren't crazy. They're normal. And that's when you look around your home, your obligations, your hopes and dreams, and realize, maybe you're stuck in the traffic jam, too.

[[[It's Just A Dream]]] was my entry into the 2015 Reimagining Contest. This was the first thing I posted on the site, and I was compelled to write about [[[SCP-209]]]. The horror that item makes for me was that it makes the drinker comfortable with torturing someone to death. But then I realized that we're all comfortable with horrible, bizarre brutality when we dream. And thus, it was born.

One of these days, I want to write a sequel, where the junior researcher realizes that SCP-209 isn't a dream machine, but a glass of scotch after all...

[[[100 Feet of ROPE!]]] and [[[Twisted Together]]] is an experiment for me. I'm writing a series in snippets, flashes, moments of time filled with thought and emotion. No, it's not for everyone. I'm aware of that. I might rejigger things at a later date. But I have to try different things whenever possible.

[[[The Journal of K. M. Sandoval]]] is a collaboration with [*user LadyKatie] and the start of a new canon, //On Mount Golgotha//. Mainly meant as a set piece and introduction, it's to tell us what [[[SCP-012]]] is about. [[[SCP-2458]]] is a part of it, and now I'm working on pulling together the resources for more. It will grow slowly, but the story will grow deeper. Finding out about the 1966 Florence floods was key, and afforded lots of excellent photos regarding what happened.

[[tab Collaborations]]
++ Collaborations:

I entered a collection of 5 entries into the [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/experiment-log-261-ad-de SCP-261 Experiment Log]. Pocari Sweat, Chocolate Twinkies, Mystery Flavor Butterfinger BBs, LanuGoGoGo!, and Shakespeare's Scrumptious Sonnets. This was purely for fun. The idea behind LanuGoGoGo! comes from [*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanugo lanugo].

I added the entries for 2282 and the OTT 2123 entry to the [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2305-collab SCP-2305 Extended Documentation]. It's a great way to let your inner troll out safely. And just gathering all the space-based SCPs to just attack at once and fall into a cosmic-scale ball of FAIL was too tantalizing to resist.
[*http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Funny/SCPFoundation TVTropes Entry] (toward the bottom of SCP Entries)

I added a perfectly normal feather to the [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/log-of-anomalous-items Log of Anomalous Items]. It's a great place for the fridge-horror vignette along the lines of "For Sale: Baby shoes. Never worn." type. Some people ask what kind of bird it is. I ask why haven't we ever seen it before.
