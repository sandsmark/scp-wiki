**Item #:** SCP-5000

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to the size and location of SCP-5000, containment is not possible at this time. Therefore, public knowledge of SCP-5000’s true composition should be suppressed by any means necessary. This includes dissemination of false geological data, feigned historical reports, and other details elaborated upon in Document 5000-7. Public interest in landing on Mars at this time does not pose a concern, as many seem to be unaware of SCP-5000 and its neighbor. However, updated containment procedures are being worked on should public interest turn toward them.

Operatives on Specialized Lunar Containment and Research Area (AKA Lunar Area 32) are to monitor SCP-5000 and SCP-5000-1 for unusual behavior. Expeditions to SCP-5000 through the use of SCP-5000-1 must obtain the approval of Site Director Dan Howell and Head Researcher Naomi Lyons. Groups are to consist of two armed agents in addition to required personnel. Teams are advised to report in every hour.

**ADDENDUM ██/██/████:** Following the events of Expedition IV, Mobile Task Force Delta-6 (Marvin Martians) has been created for further explorations of SCP-5000, as well as finding SCP-5000-B. SCP-5000-A is being held in a standard humanoid containment cell in Lunar Area 32. Further expeditions to SCP-5000 are discouraged unless deemed absolutely necessary.

**Description:** SCP-5000 is publicly known as Mars’s smallest moon, Deimos, named for the Greek God of terror. Object has a surface area of 495.1 km2 and a mass of 1.48 * 1015 kg. SCP-5000’s appearance as a normal celestial body is believed to be a combination of holographic illusion and millions of years of damage.

SCP-5000 is a large spacecraft of extraterrestrial origin. There is debate over whether the craft is from native Martians or another species of alternate origin. The craft possesses several internal hallways, rooms, and wiring powered by an unknown fuel source, enough to sustain life as seen in previous explorations. Exploration of SCP-5000 has been hindered due to its distance from main Foundation operations.

SCP-5000-1 is a 6.4-kilometer platform of unknown material that, when stepped on, can transport a subject and forty (40) kilograms of equipment to an exterior room in SCP-5000. The room appears to be a hanger, with a single ship, inoperable save for guns attached to the front, being present. The exterior wall, when walked through, returns a subject to SCP-5000-1. The room is sealed with a door of similar material that has so far been unable to be damaged and has hindered the first three expeditions. However, development on a key to hack into the systems of SCP-5000 has been ongoing.

**Incident Report ██-██-████:** The following transmission was received from SCP-5000 and picked up on dead channels of GRU Division “P”.

> We have been waiting. Help us.

**Internal Memo, Junior Researcher Thomas Yaltz to Head Researcher Naomi Lyons**
> So, I heard we’re going on another expedition. That’s exciting! I also heard you were looking to bring a Junior Researcher. I was hoping you would pick me.
> 
> I’m sure the site director has given you [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-507 |some details on my history]]], so I may seem like a bit of a gamble. But I like to think of it more as experience that can help me in the field. Not to mention, between the 3008 incident and every time I’ve taken lead on the research with the stuff we have gotten from 5000, I think I’m as qualified as someone of my position can be.
> 
> Plus, I'm very observant. I have all sorts of questions. Who sent this message? Why now? Why is it in English?
> 
> I hope you consider me for the expedition.

**SCP-5000 Expedition IV FOR LEVEL 3 ONLY**
Following the transmission from SCP-5000, Head Researcher Dr. Naomi Lyons requested a team to investigate, citing the prototype of a key able to open the doorway from the hangar. After discussions with the Site Director and O5 Council, the following team was gathered:

•	Dr. Naomi Lyons, Head Researcher (56)
•	Dr. Regina Beale, Researcher (45)
•	Junior Researcher Thomas Yaltz (26)
•	Agent Helen Troy (39)[[footnote]] Agent assigned as handler to SCP-507. [[/footnote]]
•	Agent Jonathan Bell (31)

Agents Bell and Troy were outfitted with cameras, while Dr. Beale was designated to take written notes and Junior Researcher Yaltz to take photographs.

> **Lyons:** Stop it.
> 
> //Bell quiets. Beale approaches Lyons.//
> 
> **Beale:** Are we walking into a trap?
> 
> **Lyons:** Most likely.
> 
> **Beale:** So what are we doing here?
> 
> **Lyons:** Just because it’s a trap doesn’t mean we have nothing to gain from it.
> 
> //The team approaches the door. Troy pulls Yaltz aside.//
> 
> **Troy:** Are you gonna be alright, kid? You’re overdue for a shift.
> 
> **Yaltz:** Yeah, I’ll be fine. I've seen worse. And I mean, you’re here to protect me, right? Since it’s your job?
> 
> **Troy:** Today was supposed to be my day off.
> 
> **Yaltz:** Oh, uh…
> 
> **Troy:** Kidding. Come on.
> 
> //They rejoin the team. Dr. Lyons pulls the key, a black card, from her pocket and scans it against the door. The door slowly slides open. The hallway it opens to is empty and seemingly abandoned. It is three meters tall.//
> 
> **Lyons:** Shall we?
> 
> //They move through the hall.//
> 
> **Beale:** There’s writing on the walls. Look.
> 
> //Yaltz looks, then shields his eyes.//
> 
> **Yaltz:** Shit, is it memetic?
> 
> **Beale:** I don’t think so. I think it’s [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/second-hytoth-hub |Ortrothan]]]. Don’t suppose any of you can speak it.
> 
> //The team moves on. More writing is discovered on the walls. Later analysis shows the writings roughly translate to “Help” and “Mercy”. The team enters a large chamber.//

[[collapsible show="Notes from Dr. Regina Beale during Expedition IV of SCP-5000" hide="-Access Granted"]]
The size of the chamber was the first thing that stood out to me. It wasn’t really that it was tall, but the architecture of the rest of the room with the hallway suggested it was of average size for whatever species roamed here. Not human.

Another thing that popped out about the chamber were the six cells surrounding us. The doors were flung open and emptied. Still, we all picked one to analyze. Bell seemed to almost hope a monster would leap out at us. Lyons focused on the central pillar.

I followed her eyeline. Above us was what seemed to be a keyboard and a monitor. We didn’t bring any equipment to climb up there, but there was a piece of paper we managed to knock down. The texture suggested something other than paper, but the details were the same- some kind of map.
Dr. Lyons has some experience with rockets and spacecrafts. She pointed out what seemed to be a launch site for this thing. Other geographic details lined up with the Martian surface below us.

This craft is definitely designed for war, but Yaltz pointed out the cells were more like something the Foundation would have for study.

Bright side? The architecture isn’t randomly shifting like [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1730 |Site-13]]], so… there’s that.

> //The team moves on from the chamber and through the halls. As they round a corner, Agent Troy encounters a body on the floor. The subject appears to be roughly 2 meters tall, with a physical similarity to a praying mantis.//
> 
> **Troy:** Fucking hell! Back!
> 
> //She pushes the team back. Dr. Lyons looks over her.//
> 
> **Lyons:** I think it’s dead, Agent Troy.
> 
> //Agent Troy relaxes. Dr. Lyons and Dr. Beale approach the subject.//
> 
> **Beale:** I think we found what operated those computers.
> 
> **Lyons:** And what killed it. Look.
> 
> //Lyons flips the body over. It displays a curved bullet wound, winding through the area designated its hip and out of its neck.//
> 
> **Beale:** That ain’t right.
> 
> //Yaltz raises his camera.//
> 
> **Troy:** Thomas!
> 
> **Yaltz:** It’s for research!
> 
> //He snaps a picture. Dr. Lyons takes out a pair of pliers and removes a bullet/fly-hybrid from the creature’s neck.//
> 
> **Yaltz:** Is that a fly?
> 
> **Lyons:** It’s been modified. Bio-organic technology. This “fly” was fired.
> 
> **Yaltz:** From a gun? That’s so cool!
> 
> //Everyone looks at Junior Researcher Yaltz.//
> 
> **Yaltz:** Sorry.
> 
> //Agent Troy pats his shoulder.//
> 
> **Bell:** Hey, what’s that?
> 
> //Agent Bell points further down the hall to a room. Inside, a deceased pterodactyl-like creature is seen crashed through the hull of the ship. On the side of the creature appears to be a door. The team enters the room. There are two other exits, one being closed. A large monitor with a keyboard of various symbols sits in the corner. Dr. Beale goes to touch the creature.//
> 
> **Voyich:** I wouldn’t touch that if I were you.
> 
> //Agents Troy and Bell spin toward the man, an average sized man in a cosmonaut suit. He appears to be of Ukrainian descent. Both agents have pointed their guns.//
> 
> **Troy:** Who the hell are you?
> 
> **Voyich:** I am Colonel Aleksandr Voyich, but I should be asking you that question. I’ve only ever seen my comrades in this place.
> 
> //Dr. Beale slowly steps in front of the agents.//
> 
> **Beale:** My name is Dr. Regina Beale. I’m a Researcher with the SCP Foundation. We came to investigate a transmission. Did you send it?
> 
> **Voyich:** I have been sending transmissions for what feels like ages. I thought my comrades would pick it up. But I will not complain.
> 
> **Beale:** Are there more of you?
> 
> **Voyich:** Yes. Wait here. Smirnov! Kuznetsov! Help has arrived!

> //Voyich runs down the hall.//

> Dear President Brezhnev,
> 
> 	On 3 July, at 3:00pm Moscow time, we launched the Volstok 7, manned with seven of our finest cosmonauts. Thanks to the use of [DATA EXPUNGED], we were able to get the seven-man crew among the stars within minutes.
> 
> 	However, we suffered a technical error with the crew. The navigation system directed them past the moon and out of our radio communications’ broadcast length. We have been unable to reestablish contact. The scientists called it – we have lost them. We do not know where they have landed. Or if they will land.

> 
> **Voyich:** These men are Vladamir Smirnov and Anatoly Kuznetsov. They’re what remains of the crew.
> 
> **Yaltz:** What happened to the rest of the men?
> 
> **Smirnov:** Some… walked away… never return. Others vanish… while we sleep.
> 
> **Yaltz:** When did you guys launch?

> **Beale:** What?
> 
> //Dr. Lyons approaches the monitor.//
> 
> **Lyons:** There may be some information we can get from this. Are any of you familiar with these computers?
> 
> **Smirnov:** Kuznetsov, [speaks Russian].
> 
> //Kuznetsov approaches the monitor and exposes some wires. After a few moments, the monitor beeps to life.//
> 
> **Voyich:** Perhaps we should be going?
> 
> **Lyons:** Are you kidding? We’re getting close to answers! This whole ship must be powered by solar energy. At least as a back-up.
> 
> //Dr. Lyons slowly works her way through the computer. Yaltz takes pictures.//
> 
> **Lyons:** This is all in Ortrothan, so I can’t read much. There are maps in here. Seems they came from another galaxy. And they were invading, but it looks like… looks like they were running from something.
> 
> **Troy:** Oh, good. The scary aliens were running from something scarier. Seems you’re just turning up more questions, doc.
> 
> **Lyons:** We might get more answers behind that door. Agent Bell, open that door for me?
> 
> //Dr. Lyons hands Agent Bell the key. He approaches the door.//

> **Beale:** I thought we were leaving after this?
>

> **Smirnov:** That… uniform. Is… ours.
> 
> **Voyich:** Whatever did this might be here now. We should leave!
> 
> **Bell:** He’s got a tag on him!
> 
> **Kuznetsov:** Aleksy? Sergei?
> 
> **Bell:** It says, “Voyich”.
> 
> //The team turns to Voyich, who is staring at the ground.//
> 
> **“Voyich”:** You just had to look, didn’t you?
> 
> //Multiple black rods shoot from Voyich’s body. Two from his chest, three from his back, two from his right hip. Kuznetsov is stabbed through the eye and drops. Agent Bell is stabbed through the heart. Life signs terminated quickly. Dr. Beale and Smirnov drop to the floor and narrowly avoid the attack. Agent Troy pulls Yaltz to the ground. Dr. Lyons is stabbed in the leg.//
> 
> **“Voyich”:** I said we should leave! That thing could be in here! Well, guess what? I am! And I’m pissed!
> 
> //Voyich grabs Kuznetsov by the neck, who whimpers and struggles to breathe.//
> 
> **“Voyich”:** I’ll give you this, “comrade”. You guys were the most fun I’ve had in hundreds of thousands of cycles. Last thing before that, these guys sent me to destroy a planet. The violence, Kuznetsov. The mind games. Oh, that was art. Before you guys, all I had were corpses.
> 
> //Voyich snaps Kuznetsov’s neck.//
> 
> **“Voyich”:** But now I can leave this place. I have no use for you anymore.
> 
> //Voyich approaches Dr. Lyons. As he is focused on her, the others back away.//
> 
> **“Voyich”:** Dr. Lyons, was it? Oh, I’m going to have fun with you.

> **Lyons:** All of you, run!
> 
> //Lyons pulls out her gun.//
> 
> **Yaltz:** Dr. Lyons!

> **“Voyich”:** What does that thing do? Shoot metal? That won’t stop me.
> 
> **Lyons:** Then get out of the way!
> 
> //Dr. Lyons shoots the control pad on the door. It slams shut. Another shot is heard, followed by the sound of depressurization. Dr. Beale continues to stand at the door.//
> 
> **Troy:** Dr. Beale! She bought us some time! We need to move!
> 
> //She follows. The team arrives back at the hangar.//
> 
> **Yaltz:** That thing knows where we came from. If it's survived this long, it'll probably get out of there. Can we close the door?
> 
> **Troy:** I think Bell had the key.
> 
> **Beale:** Shit.
> 
> //She looks at the ship.//
> 
> **Beale:** Then we blow the hangar to kingdom come. You guys go.
> 
> **Yaltz:** No, I’ll stay. You go.
> 
> **Beale:** Yaltz, I admire the resolve, but as of now, I’m the leader. I won’t leave you here with no way out.
> 
> **Yaltz:** Have you read my file, Dr. Beale?
> 
> **Beale:** What does your personnel file have to do with this?
> 
> **Yaltz:** No, my special containment procedures file.

> **Beale:** The teleporting kid?
> 
> **Yaltz:** I’m twenty-six at this point, but yeah. If I stay, I’ll teleport off this thing eventually and get back home.
> 
> **Beale:** Then we’ll all stay.
> 
> **Yaltz:** You have an anomalous subject with you. I think they’d understand it if you left. I’ve been handling weird shit since I was born, ma’am. I’ll be okay.
> 
> **Troy:** And I’ll stay with him. I’m your handler, kid. You don’t get a say.
> 
> **Beale:** If you’re doing this, she stays.
> 
> //Yaltz opens his mouth, then closes it and nods. Dr. Beale and Smirnov suit up and return through SCP-5000-1. Yaltz and Agent Troy, also suited up, board the smaller ship.//

> **Troy:** To kingdom come.

**After-Action Report: SCP-5000 Expedition IV**
Following the events of Expedition IV, a large explosion was detected from SCP-5000. Three life signatures and numerous piles of debris emerged through SCP-5000-1. The explosion was explained as a meteor strike. Dr. Regina Beale was promoted to Head Researcher of SCP-5000, while Dr. Naomi Lyons and Agent Johnathan Bell were posthumously honored. Vladamir Smirnov was designated SCP-5000-A. Junior Researcher Thomas Yaltz and Agent Helen Troy were discovered in Waco, Texas nine days later, with non-threatening injuries.
