**Item #:**  SCP-473

**Object Class:**  Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:**  A 5 kilometer Prohibited Zone is to be maintained around SCP-473.  Access requires level 4 authorization.  A 5 kilometer Kill Zone is to extend beyond the Prohibited Zone, and a 5 kilometer Detention Zone is to extend beyond the Kill Zone.  Any craft approaching the Detention Zone is to be turned away on the grounds of ongoing military exercises in the area.  Crews of craft which enter the Detention Zone may be interrogated and released after Class-A amnesiacs are administered.  Any craft entering the Kill Zone is to be destroyed immediately.  Loss of life within the Prohibited Zone is to be avoided at all costs.

**Description:**  SCP-473 is a wrecked Spanish galleon typical of those used in the early 16th century.  It is located under ████ meters of water at ██º██'██"N ███º██'██"W.  SCP-473 was brought to the attention of the Foundation after the loss of the research vessel ████, operated by [REDACTED] University.  Search and Rescue teams reported audio anomalies "like children giggling" and voices in English, Spanish and an unknown language.  Agents embeded in [REDACTED] immediately moved to cancel the search, declaring the crew and vessel lost.

**Note:**  Though the wreck is designated SCP-473, anomalies present may be due to cargo within the wreck.  Further investigation of this is advised against at this time.

**Proximity Effects:**  Phenomena encountered by ships approaching SCP-473 include disembodied voices (which may have knowledge of Foundation personnel and operations) and minor physical disturbances such as unidentified vibrations and impacts on the ship.  Electrical disturbances are common, causing primary and emergency lighting to fail.  This results in absolute darkness within a ship which, combined with persuasive voices created by SCP-473, causes extreme disorientation.  Personnel in the area are advised to confirm the physical presence of anyone they are in communication with and to ignore any voices that have no discernible source.  Periodic cries for help from the water (coming from the direction of SCP-473) are to be expected and ignored.  --Spontaneous movement of small objects has been observed, but has caused little disruption to operations.--  Sharp objects are to be secured in locked containers while within 15km of SCP-473.

**Addendum 1:**
The following is email correspondence of Professor █████, former head of the Department of Archaeology at [REDACTED] University.

> Sent   1/15/20██
> Samantha,
> Sure I can, the research papers are wordy and I could never put my opinion in them anyway.
> 
> Now, when [NAME REDACTED] killed the high priest in charge of appeasing Supai, he also captured his two daughters and arranged to have them sent back to Spain as examples of the indigenous population.  The ship's manifest listed a number of cultural artifacts in the girls' personal belongings.  I think the girls were taking it to Spain.  Hell, it doesn't matter.  The manifest lists all manner of gold and artifacts that the University would love to have, even if it's not there.
> 
> All the best,
> ███████

> P.S.
> Let's keep this quiet, it'd be a disaster if someone beat us there!

**Addendum 2:**
Interview SCP-473-b

 **Interviewed:** J. ████, former Executive Officer (XO) of the Foundation destroyer ████

**Interviewer:** Dr. Halen, SCP-473 project lead

**Forward:**  The Foundation destroyer ████ penetrated 1 kilometer into what is now defined as SCP-473's Prohibited Zone  before retreating into the Kill Zone and sinking.  Evacuation of the ship was successful (excepting the captain), but 16 hands were lost during the 3 hours the crew awaited rescue.  Below is an interview with the highest ranked surviving officer.

> **<Begin Log, [April 17, 20██]>**
> 
> **Dr. Halen:**  The destroyer ████ sank minutes after coming within 5 kilometers of SCP-473.  Do you know how so much damage was caused?
> 
> **XO:**  Well I know what happened, no idea how though.  We kept getting closer and the voices got louder.  Below decks started reporting some hard knocking against the hull.  It got really bad inside of 5 kilometers though.  The ship started to vibrate a bit and some of the electronics shorted out.  The captain ordered us to turn around, tried to get us out of there.  But by the time we’d come about, they’d already started in on the bolts.
> 
> **Dr. Halen:**  They started to what?
> 
> **XO:**  The god damn ship started to fall apart from the inside, doc.  Screws, bolts, nails in the damn furniture… it all started getting knocked out or unscrewed.  It didn’t matter if it was welded in place or not.  The voices got bad too; they were coming from right behind you sometimes.  The girls would start giggling on one side of you, then instantly start giggling on your other side.  It felt like dozens of people were talking to us, or trying to.  And the bastards were always so matter-of-fact and calm, even while they were rattling the ship all to hell and taking everything apart.  A guy on my right said "It's better this way," and a woman on my left said "You don't have to fight anymore," but there was nobody there, it wasn't our crew talking to me.  It got hard to tell which voices were our crew and which were the damn... whatever they were.
> 
> **Dr. Halen:**  When was the last time you saw Captain █████?
> 
> **XO:**  [XO sighs audibly] It was right after he gave the order to turn around.  He told me to handle things on the bridge while he checked something below deck.  I didn’t know he was missing until after I gave the order to abandon ship and everyone was in the rafts but him.  God if that’d only been the end of it…
> 
> [XO pauses]
> 
> We started rowing away from the wreck and we heard him yelling for help.  It was far off, toward the shipwreck.  He and I served together for █ years, we helped bring in SCP-███, I //know// it was him.  I figured he’d gotten knocked overboard or something.  And I gave the order for a raft to go get him.  Watched them get close to the horizon, must have been 3 or 4 kilometers from the shipwreck when they just went under.  No sound to it, like a kid’s bobber getting pulled under by a fish on the line.  I’ve seen men die, doc, but I know I sent those guys someplace a lot worse.
> 
> Wasn’t long after that that Daniels started whispering to me about what a bastard I was, how I sent them all to die for nothing.  He said the only way to make it right was to jump out of the raft and join him.  God I would have too, if not for the other guys on my raft.  We spent the next 2 hours rowing, with our friends screaming for help behind us.
> 
> Even while they were screaming from behind us, they didn't stop whispering in our ears.  My friend █████ told me it was the most beautiful thing he'd ever seen.  He never was religious, but he said that he'd found God.  He said he only wanted me to see what Supai had shown him.
> I don’t know what’s down there, doc, but it’s still got them...  Daniels, those kids, that Professor... all of them.
> 
> **<End Log>**

**Closing Statement:**  Professor █████ and associates present on the research vessel ████ are confirmed to have been acquired by SCP-473.  Further research has concluded that the only Inca voices present are those of the children known to have been aboard the wreck, indicating that SCP-473 only began acquiring subjects after one or more deaths on the galleon itself.  Recommend extreme measures be taken to prevent personnel and civilians from expiring in close proximity to SCP-473.  Currently advise maintaining containment at present location due to the inherent danger of recovery and the threat of exponential strengthening through acquisition of Class-D subjects at any given Site.

**Note:**  Interview subject J. ████'s corpse was found in his quarters on April 24, 20██, suicide is suspected.  A note nearby read "I SHOULDNT HAVE LEFT THEM".  Testing of SCP-473 as a possible cognitohazard is ongoing.
