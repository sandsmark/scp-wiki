**Item #:** SCP-380

**Object Class:** Safe/Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** This object should be kept connected to a small computer in health lab H██, in the off position. The object may be disconnected and moved to any computer that is capable of an internet connection, but by the request of Dr. ████████, should never be attached to a computer with internet access.

**Description:** SCP-380 is a small, blue box with an appearance not unlike an internet router. It has a single antenna, a few lights, a power switch and a single T3-line female connector. Although there is no plug for an outside source of electricity, SCP-380 will work when it is connected to a network-capable computer and the 'power' switch in the on position.

The device then autoconnects to the computer it is wired to (furthermore referenced as SCP-380-1), and will open a large network connection (slower computers have been known to lock up completely from the immense connection). Instead of the wireless network connection being with other computers, however, the network formed seems to be with biological units within a 50 foot radius. Humans, animals, plants, and any other sort of biological component can form this network.

As biological components enter and leave the radius of connection, they are added and subtracted from the network. Test subjects (and it is assumed all biological units) are not aware that they are connected to a network. The only access that is obvious is the ability for SCP-380-1 to access biological components.

When a biological component is accessed, it contains a single text document readable by whichever operating system is being utilized by SCP-380-1. This text document contains variables like 'heart rate', 'stress', and 'blood glucose level' - all types of biological components, some of which not even advanced monitoring systems are able to predict as efficiently, or at all.

**Experiment 380-01**: Attempts to edit any of the text documents kept in organic 'files' has responded with a message reading "ERROR 271: Data out of range.", and the loss of any changes made to the file.

**Experiment 380-02**: Normal health monitoring devices have shown the numbers reflected from organic 'files' to be accurate and therefore should be accepted as true. Research into using SCP-380 as an advanced health monitoring device is in the works.
