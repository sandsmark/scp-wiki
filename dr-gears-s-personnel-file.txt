**Yearly review interview excerpt:**

**05-██:** [DATA EXPUNGED]

**Dr. Gears:** No, it’s not that they’re “out to get us”. Nothing is out to get us. Review the data, most of the SCP items do not actively seek to damage or harm anything. It’s an extension of their basic function, like a car emitting exhaust. It’s not that it intends to produce a toxic mix of chemicals; it’s just what it was made to do.

**05-██:** [DATA EXPUNGED]

**Dr. Gears:** With very few exceptions, no, I don’t think they are. Their existence is just a determent to our existence. Others may view these things as basic as children’s toys or a spark plug. It’s like rabbits in Australia; they are out of their element.

**05-██:** [DATA EXPUNGED]

**Dr. Gears:** Why would they be sent to us? We all need to put away our “Mars Attacks!” cards and start being realistic. We are not under attack. We are not the “last line of defense”. We are not on the cusp of a new era. No one is out to get us, and no one is going to save us. These things exist because they exist, and will do whatever it is they do. I think that’s the problem we have, we want there to be some great plot or underlying reason for this. There’s not. We are alone, and the universe does not care. At least, I sincerely hope it doesn’t.
