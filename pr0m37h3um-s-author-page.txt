> "I fucking hate Prometheus. Prometheus is a piece of shit. A damn Ralsei avatar looking ass got picked over actual children at an orphanage and he’s supposed to be a hero? And I can’t even tell you how many damn times I’ve seen a great parking space only to turn the corner and realize Prometheus is already parked there in his stupid little fucking pr0mCar. He took my wife and the kids and my house and my job. I swear to fucking god, I’m going to kill myself and take that goddamn Ralsei bitch to hell with me. Prometheus has ruined my family. Last summer, I approached the dumb writing bitch  in the street, and asked him for his autograph, because my son is a huge fan. The fucking dweeb gave me the autograph and told me to burn in hell. Later, when I gave my son the autograph he started crying and said he hated me. Turns out Prometheus didnt write his autograph, no, he wrote “you’re a piece of shit, and i fucked your mom”. I’m now divorced, and planning a huge class-action lawsuit against the devil that ruined my life. Your time is almost over, Prometheus. All the people you’ve wronged will rise against you."

++ Solo SCP Articles
> +++ [[[SCP-4976]]]: The Humanity of the Moment
> Ah, the beginning. This was my first SCP and my first thing on the site overall, and it's... decent. I don't think it's //bad//, but hey. It's alright. According to [[*user Ihp]], it's a "pretty good" addition to the Class of '76.

> +++ [[[SCP-4320]]]: Show Me The Glint of Light on Broken Glass
> My favorite thing I've written. I really wish it got more attention. It's entirely original and in my opinion better than 4976, but I guess people like 4976 more. I respect that. But please do read this, I want more people to see it --and it's important for my tales--.

++ Collab SCP Articles
> +++ [[[SCP-5015]]]: (Not) All Who Wander Are Lost
> Written with [[*user Doctor North]]. 
> 
> I will acknowledge that there are still some problems with this article, and there are some things I'm still working on fixing, but honestly? I had a load of fun writing this. It was originally an entry in the SCP-5000 contest, and while we weren't really expecting to win, we're satisfied with the number we ended up with.

++ Tales
> +++ [[[A Great Palace Atop the World]]]
> The first installment in a currently unnamed series revolving around events involving SCP-4320. I think it's pretty good actually, considering I wrote it from scratch within 2 hours.

> +++ [[[The World Below]]]
> Part 2 of the same series as A Great Palace Atop the World. It's not the last though. Currently, it's the most recent --although they were actually posted within seconds of each other--, but there should be more coming out soon-ish.
