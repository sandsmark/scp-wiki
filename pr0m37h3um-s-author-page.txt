> +++ [[[SCP-4976]]]
> Ah, the beginning. This was my first SCP and my first thing on the site overall, and it's... decent. I don't think it's //bad//, but hey. It's alright. According to [[*user Ihp]], it's a "pretty good" addition to the Class of '76.

> +++ [[[SCP-4320]]]
> My favorite thing I've written. I really wish it got more attention. It's entirely original and in my opinion better than 4976, but I guess people like 4976 more. I respect that. But please do read this, I want more people to see it --and it's important for my tales--.

++ Tales
> +++ [[[A Great Palace Atop the World]]]
> The first installment in a currently unnamed series revolving around events involving SCP-4320. I think it's pretty good actually, considering I wrote it from scratch within 2 hours.

> +++ [[[The World Below]]]
> Part 2 of the same series as A Great Palace Atop the World. It's not the last though. Currently, it's the most recent --although they were actually posted within seconds of each other--, but there should be more coming out soon-ish.
