**Name:** Researcher Lloyd (official title), ████ ████████ (personal usage), Bunton (out-dated alternative name, assigned for reference as per Protocol ███)

**Security Clearance Level:** Level 2/[[[SCP-1168|1168]]]-[[[SCP-1186|1186]]], etc. (see below)

**Position:** Researcher

**Qualifications:** Master’s degree in entomology.

**Location:** Site-██, ██ and ███, as necessary.

**History:** Recruited from the University of ████████ on ████-██-██, after he and several colleagues were found to have received and been studying the remains of an SCP-████ specimen. While the rest of those involved were administered amnesiacs as per protocol, he was found to display a notable lack of surprise at the nature of the subject, stating that it was simply “just one of those weird things that happens” (see Document F733-P: "Psychosis-Preventing Dispositions in Recruitment Candidates"). Later employed as an Assistant level Researcher at the suggestion of Agent █████.

Of note is the fact that Researcher Lloyd has no standard given name. This is apparently due to his family (collectively identified by the term “Lycon”)’s atypical nomenclature, which is not entirely consistent with standard Western naming convention. All given names resemble those of a previous member who had achieved a high level of notoriety, resulting in (presumably due to some oversight) most members having very similar names.

The pseudonym “████ ████████” has been assigned for personal use.

Notable excerpts from a correspondence between Rsr. Lloyd  and Dr. ██████ regarding the former's [REDACTED]:

> //We live in a rather fantastical world. We both see evidence of that daily, it being the subject of our work. A world in which anomalies, inexplicable and crude, do not only exist but are// prevalent//. I simply consider the life that occurs with such conditions, how creatures surrounded by often empathetic abnormalities, would adapt.//

> //Once you have accepted magic as a possibility, you must also accept the wide variety of related concepts which logically result.//

> […] //sheeps.//

**Incident ███-███:** On ████-██-██, after monthly screening, Researcher Lloyd was found to be host to several //Dermatobia hominis// eggs. Follow up interviews revealed that he had voluntary exposed himself to a female botfly. His reasons were stated to be that “[he] wanted to see what it was like”. As a result, he is currently on forced leave, and is to attend mandatory psychological counselling sessions.

//This presents a clear contamination risk. Something needs to be done. If not termination, perhaps discharge. At least transfer him to something less active, preferably more paperwork oriented.// – Dr. Wilkinson
