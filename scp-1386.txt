**Item #:** SCP-1386

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1386 is not to be approached by more than five people at one time, and each person that comes within a 3 meter radius of the subject must give the appearance of being happy, such as by smiling or laughing. When making contact with SCP-1386, it is strongly advised to have at least twenty dollars of American currency in hand and in plain view of it.

SCP-1386 has been relocated to an evacuated neighborhood in ████████, following the incident with Doctor F██████ on 4/17/12. It is to be kept under constant surveillance to prevent further incidents such as these.

**Description:** SCP-1386 is a white “Good Humor” brand ice cream truck, in poor condition and lacking any images or descriptions of the products it sells. The van appears to be sentient as it drives without a person behind the wheel, and after the investigation of 3/15/12, it has been concluded that none of the doors or windows on the vehicle open through conventional means. The van plays instrumental melodies of “Pop Goes the Weasel” and “Twinkle Twinkle Little Star” 24 hours a day, alternating between the two every four hours. On occasion, it has been known to play a version of “Greensleeves,” but will immediately switch to another song when in the presence of customers.

SCP-1386 has a thin slot in the middle of its driver side door, which only becomes visible when it dispenses the various ice cream products it sells. Along with the ice cream, the van slides out a small slip of receipt paper with a price written on it. The writing on the paper has been described as “very sloppy, but legible,” and bears a striking resemblance to the penmanship of ████ ████████. The van receives payment through the same slot it delivers ice cream from, and will drive away as soon as it is paid. The prices and flavors of the ice cream products it sells fluctuate daily, but it never runs out of its stock of items. Notable tests of the van are as follows:

3/30/12 - Doctors R██████ and D████ each requested one cookies and creme smoothie, and they were dispensed as asked. However, one smoothie was marked with a handwritten M and the other a handwritten G. The receipt was for "$4.89," and was paid without incident.

4/1/12 - Doctor D████ requested one Neapolitan ice cream sandwich. After several seconds, the van slid out what appeared to be a meat and cheese sandwich with tomato. The sandwich was made out of chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry ice cream, respectively. The receipt given read “april fool’s!” and the van drove away before Doctor D████ could inquire about payment.

4/12/12 - Doctor D████ asked for a single-scoop vanilla ice cream in a waffle cone. The product was dispensed as asked, with a receipt that read “$0.72,” and was paid without incident.

4/17/12 - Doctor F██████ requested one peach push-pop and received it, along with a receipt of “$16.27.” Doctor F██████ expressed disapproval at the price for the ice cream and refused to pay the full amount, instead paying a total of $3.75 in quarters. When Doctor F██████ attempted to walk away, the van opened the slot in its door to an approximate height of six feet and [DATA EXPUNGED].

4/27/12 - Doctor R██████ asked the van for a cherry Popsicle, adding: “with nuts.” The van seemed to wait several seconds as if it were thinking, then dispensed a single cherry Popsicle, unwrapped, with nuts embedded in the ice. The receipt given read “$2.20 you’re nuts!” and Doctor R██████ was recorded as chuckling as she read the paper. The van was paid without incident.

4/30/12 - Doctor J████ requested a "Caesar Salad flavor" Popsicle. After a few moments, the van dispensed a Popsicle with an off-green coloration which was noted to taste of "lightly dressed lettuce with a hint of croutons." The receipt was for "$4.56" and was paid without incident.

5/4/12 - Doctor J████ asked for a "Dark Chocolate Fudge Pop," and received it with a receipt of "$1.38," and paid for it with two single-dollar bills. After receiving payment, the van made a sound akin to a cash register from within what is presumably the area in which ice cream is stored, and then dispensed a small factory-wrapped package. There was no written indication of what was contained inside the package, but on the front there was a crudely-drawn image of what appeared to be various coins, all of American currency. The van drove off once the package was dispensed, and a D-class operative was assigned to inspect the contents of the package. The package was found to have a total of $.62 in American currency, and Doctor J████ was noted as saying "Incredible! I have never gotten exact change from an ice cream truck in my life!"
