With respect, Captain, none of this can possibly contain information the whole site wasn't aware of before.

For the record, you totally traded down.

Hey man, how come this one even has some Javanese date and matchmaking articles? It even has prediction dates for some of our personnel... Let's see... Iceberg, Kliwon Friday ██th ████████, ████... 'Be careful, watch for the flying money hidden dump' ...I seriously can't decipher this one.
