//Note:// 
WHO THE HELL IS PRINT ABOUT MY SEX LIFE
SON OF THE BITCH
I HAVE YOUR --HEAD-- ASS FOR THIS YOU SON OF A BITCHES

//-D. Strelnikov//


With respect, Captain, none of this can possibly contain information the whole site wasn't aware of before.
//-Dr. Light//

For the record, you totally traded down. 
//-Agent Yoric//

Hey man, how come this one even has some Javanese date and matchmaking articles? It even has prediction dates for some of our personnel... Let's see... Iceberg, Kliwon Friday ██th ████████, ████... 'Be careful, watch for the flying money hidden dump' ...I seriously can't decipher this one.
//-Agent Carriontrooper//

347? I totally voted for 808.
//-Agent Imants//

MOVE ALONG NOW, NOTHING TO SEE HERE, PEOPLE.
IN PARTICULAR, PAGE SIXTEEN IS TO BE TREATED AS, ahem, A CLASS- uh, TWELVE MEMETIC HAZARD.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR COOPERATION.
//-Dr. Klein//

I am not a Monkey.
//-Dr. Bright//

On the upside, the extra advertisement from the ban should sell enough to cover printing cos- er, nevermind. How do I make it erase that?
//-Agent Yoric//

It all really depends on your definition of Doctor, I suppose. I refuse to comment beyond that.
//-Lurker//

So THAT is what happened to that poor, poor pony.
//-Dr. Ziegler//

Damn. I expected an article about Strelnikov's beak wetting habits, but I didn't expect close-up pictures...
//-Dr. Kald//

I think I was at that wedding.
//-Agent Nicholakis//

I was at 914 and Gears' counselling session. It was the most uninteresting thing ever.
//-Agent Spoon//

Whoever came up with "Dear Able: Advice for the Lovelorn": that was funny as hell, and it was nice knowing you.
//-Dr. Lambert//

Everything on page 16 is FALSE. FALSEFALSEFALSE. And I swear I'm going to hurt someone the next time I hear the word "Necrololi".
//~Dr. Trebuchet//

Well, at least the sudoku puzzle was challenging.
//-- Fishmonger//

Regarding the article on page 24 about my botched attempt to get 050... The pictures about the "Sushi-Inator" are just photoshops of 914 with inari-sushi filling! I wasn't even near 914 that day, so shut up about trying to get pictures of Josie wrapped in seaweed! IT NEVER HAPPENED!
//-Dr. Okagawa//

That Pisces horoscope regarding 999 is just downright disturbing.
//-Dr. Armstrong//

Jesus Strelnikov, I had to turn those pictures upside down twice before I realised what they were showing.
//- Dr. Aeish//

I don't know how they got hold of pictures with me in bed with that girl and my Mauser... But I do know that a world of pain awaits them once I puzzle it all out.
//-Agent Malign//
