[[tab Description and Capabilities]]

**Name:** [[[scp-4406|Codename WHISPER IN THE WIND]]]

**Irregularity Cross-reference:** Electronic, Thaumaturgic, Ontological, Surveillance, Software

**Capabilities:** WHISPER IN THE WIND is currently capable of high- and low-level C2,[[footnote]]Command and Control[[/footnote]] including remote access to all peripherals onboard (including but not limited to serial communication, cameras, microphones, and human interface devices), screen recording, keylogging, arbitrary code execution, parallelized completion of tasks on remote computing devices, and advanced persistence across air-gapped and networked devices.

**Purpose/Motive:** The WHISPER IN THE WIND project was proposed, in conjunction with Pentagram,[[footnote]]The Occult Branch of the Department of Defense[[/footnote]] to gain and retain access to systems as deemed necessary by the United States for the purposes of intercepting and obstructing terrorism, distribution of child pornography, and unlawful entry into the United States.

**Modus Operandi:** Access to systems is provided and maintained by the WHISTLE protocol, continuously delivering the WHISTLE payload (WHISPER) across the globe in 45 different instruction set architectures using thaumically-enhanced ground-penetrating radar. Once WHISTLE has delivered the payload, the WHISPER suite will verify all devices on the local area network have received the payload, and will then call home and be available to receive instructions.

**Behavior:** WHISPER is a thaumically-augmented rootkit developed in conjunction with Pentagram (See Pentagram Documentation, "CARELESS WHISPER" Ontological C2 Suite).  Once delivered to a host, WHISPER is capable of inspecting, modifying, and emptying the host's counters and registers at will. WHISPER is capable of intelligently analyzing and negating efforts to detect or access itself by manipulating the ontological validity of registers on-the-fly, replacing their values with those that are beneficial to the continued existence and operation of WHISPER.

**Results:** Currently, WHISPER IN THE WIND has been credited with stopping or affecting over ███ cases of terrorism; child pornography; human trafficking; illegal entry into the United States; or drug trafficking. WHISPER has been successfully delivered to over ███████████ devices around the world.

**Current Status:** The project has been successful thus far with only minimal extraneous costs and complications, largely ameliorated by UIU's HUMINT activities with related organizations.

**Subject:** Rootkit?
**Date:** 2018/02/14 10:47 AM

John,

I'd like to arrange a meeting to discuss a rootkit that the UIU may already be aware of, which possesses a potent ontological effect on the CU of every CPU we've been able to test with. We have reason to believe this originated with the Pentagram, this may necessitate a bit of coordination between ourselves to contain this rootkit. We haven't yet confirmed to what extent this exists in the wild due to the size of the testing apparatus, but we're hoping to have something definitive within the next 30 days.

Your assistance and expertise on this would be appreciated.

Thanks,

John,

Thank you for the response. We figured it out thanks to some new technology from the Site-11 labs in the field of applied digital ontology. I'm attaching an internal ticket that includes what we know and the steps to detect it. It involves quite a lot of math that I don't fully understand but I'm told by multiple sources it's the most likely conclusion. I think upon reading, you'll understand the severity of the issue. In the wrong hands the amount of control would be truly beyond the pale.

We'll need a little time to remediate this flaw and we'll push a new Whisper build to staging, subscribe to the {{whisper-scpf-hotfix-2018}} branch and you'll be notified when this is ready for testing (Oliver can help you do this.)

Thanks, talk soon.

John,

Great to hear, thank you. I suspect we will still need to continue investigating on our side though. I don't doubt that the teams involved are good at what they do, but the ramifications of false assumptions here are too grave to ignore, unless you have some significantly compelling evidence for me.

I do consider myself a citizen first and foremost, and love my country. I believe you when you say there are enemies abroad, I've seen too much in my work not to. But the Foundation pays my bills, and I have a job to do. I hope you can see things from my side. Frankly, it is not currently worth my while to stop the investigation yet.
