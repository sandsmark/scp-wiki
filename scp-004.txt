[[/div]]

**Item #:** SCP-004

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Clearance:** Level 1 (For clearance into affected area), Level 4 (For use of SCP-004-2)

**Special Containment Procedures:** Proper procedure for handling of SCP-004-2 is vital. The keys are not allowed off-site unless accompanied by two Level 4 Security personnel. Also, SCP-004-2 is under no circumstance to be taken through SCP-004-1. The effects of doing so are as of yet unknown, and the current costs of experimentation makes further research impractical. Assuming any of the objects contained within ever manages to leave confinement, or the facility is breached, along with the immolation and destruction of the whole facility, the keys are also to be brought inside and the doors closed along with accompanied personnel. Any security personnel removing keys from the testing area are subject to immediate termination.  

**Description:** SCP-004 is a set of twelve (12) rusted keys, and an old wooden barn door. The door itself is the entrance to an abandoned factory in //[DATA EXPUNGED]//.  


++++ Chronological History
**07/02/1949**: Door is found by a group of three juveniles trespassing on federal property near ██████████. According to testimony from the three they found a set of rusted keys in an iron lockbox and manage to determine what door the keys unlock (here after being referred to as SCP-004-2, and the door itself as SCP-004-1).  The juveniles are taken into custody after they contact Sheriff █████████████████ when one of their friends goes missing (heretoforth referred to as SCP-004-CAS01).

**07/03/1949**: Local authorities find the severed right hand of SCP-004-CAS01 eight (8) kilometers away from factory facility. Other parts of SCP-004-CAS01's body are found scattered as far as thirty-two (32) kilometers away. After interrogation the apprehended juveniles tell authorities that upon opening the door with one of the keys, SCP-004-CAS01 was torn into several pieces, each of which seemed to disappear into thin air. This is the point at which SCP takes over the investigation.

**07/04/1949**: SCP Agent █████ obtains the keys from the local authorities to begin testing. Tests show that all twelve (12) keys fit into a single lock on the large barred door. Twelve (12) Class D agents are assigned to test the effects of the door. Of the twelve (12) test subjects each trying a different key to enter the room, only two (2) survive. Opening the door with the wrong key and entering the room tore the test subjects apart in multiple directions; however, samples of the test subjects were not found until later. To this day only two (2) parts of each subject have been recovered (with the exception of one key that scattered the pieces in close proximity). The others have, for all intents and purposes, vanished from existence. Of the two surviving subjects, only one returned unharmed. The other came back in a near catatonic state, able only to remove himself from the room and then collapse on the floor. The subject had to be restrained to prevent him from gouging out his own eyes (See Appendix A: Mental Health Effects of SCP-004-2). The other subject said he had entered a large room that was impossibly big for the size of the attached building.  After the surviving, unaffected test subject came out of the door, it was propped open and an armed squad of Level 3 personnel entered the room. The size of the room is impossible to measure and the door frame and the individuals in the room are the only part of the room that can be felt or illuminated.

**07/16/1949**: The juvenile suspects in police custody and Sheriff █████████████████ are terminated.

**08/02/1949**: █████████████████ is declared a hazardous area "due to unexploded ordinance" and fences erected in order to prevent ingress by civilians. Tests begin to determine safety of exposure to environment behind SCP-004-1.

**12/01/1950**: SCP-004-1 and SCP-004-2 are put on standby until further notice after time-space anomalies are confirmed as a result of exposure.

**07/03/19██**: The unaccounted for remains of SCP-004-CAS01 appear outside the door without any outside stimulus. Despite being killed decades ago, the remains of SCP-004-CAS01 are not decomposed in any manner, still warm to the touch and have uncoagulated blood. █████████████████ notes that it is as if SCP-004-CAS01 had just been killed. Testing is being done on the remains.

**07/04/19██**: The unaccounted for remains of one of the twelve (12) original test subjects appear in similar manner to SCP-004-CAS01 the previous day. The remains have been designated SCP-004-CAS02. Records suggest that both SCP-004-CAS01 and CAS02 used the ████ key.

**03/21/1999**: With the massive proliferation of nuclear weapons and World War III only ██ years away, SCP has begun construction of a site inside SCP-004-1. The site will have supplies that will allow ███ people to survive for ████ days.

**04/21/1999**: █████████████████ has ordered the scope of the site inside SCP-004-1 to be expanded to include emergency storage for all mobile SCP-XXX specimens, as well as a ██ Petabyte database for the storage of all SCP data. The facility is now referred to as Site 62.

**09/25/2000**: Site 62 is operational. Labs and containment units are complete and can contain the most dangerous specimens and the process of backing up all SCP data has begun.

**01/25/2001**: Due to time anomalies (detailed below), all personnel working at Site 62 are required to reside on site permanently. Families of personnel are to be sent reports that loved ones perished in an industrial accident. Cloned bodies have been prepared for funeral.

**07/14/2003**: Massive power outage across Northeast United States and through Canada. Due to the initial failure of multiple SCP generators Site 62 was without power for fifty-three (53) minutes before new Generators could be initialized. During those fifty-three (53) minutes, those on site were completely without any source of light. They reported "sensing" creatures and people, but were only able to feel or hear each other. Selected facility personnel were allowed to read ████████████ (Appendix A) and said the creatures "sensed" were similar to the massive green creature described, only of similar size to humans.


++++ Time and Space Anomalies
The facility seems to propagate anomalies in the perception of reality and time as well as space.
Personnel leaving the facility report losing time. Those who have been in the site for weeks insist that they had only been in the facility for several days, and the amount of work they have completed and supplies consumed supports this.
Another time anomaly is the re-appearance of SPC-004-CAS01 and SPC-004-CAS02 exactly ██ years after their use of key ██.
████████████████████ has been assigned to investigate all aspects of these Time Anomalies.

Regarding space anomalies, the interior space of SCP-004-1 is impossibly large given the surrounding area. Similarly, the 2003 blackout incident suggests there exists an alternate plane of existence within the same space that Site 62 occupies that is accessed with the ██ key.

++++ Further Notes
Studies on the door and the set of keys reveal that ten (10) of the keys open a door to a dimension(s) where beings of our composition meet physics their bodies aren't conditioned to survive. Test subjects are torn apart, with body parts deposited in various locations with only three verified points on our planet, two being immediately deposited, the third being deposited exactly ██ years into the future. The location of the other seven locations are currently unknown. Tests continue to find ways of surviving the entry of the room, as well as the discovery that there are other doors that the keys open [See Appendix B: SCP-004-3 - SCP-004-5].

++++ Appendix A
Mental Health Effects of SCP-004-2: All Class D personnel sent through portal 11 using the 11th key come back in a catatonic state unable to speak. Some may have enough energy left to try to claw out their eyes. Of the 16 subjects, only 4 survived. Only one was able to speak again eventually after massive psychotherapy. He was able to tell the psychiatrist that he saw a massive, green creature so large that he couldn't see most of its body. In its presence he said he felt a innate fear and sudden recognition as if it was something buried deep in his primal fears. In that instant the subject claims his mind was raped and horrible memories of a past he couldn't even comprehend were forced into his mind. The subject shows an inability to remember anything except the images burned into his mind by the creature in portal 11.

++++ Appendix B
**Item #:** SCP-004-3

**Date of Discovery:** 09/02/1950

**Origin of Object:** Object was discovered elsewhere in factory area, in the previously undiscovered manager's office.

**Description:** Object appears as a large (182 cm X 129 cm), unvarnished box. The box may be unlocked by the determined "safe" key, as well as five of the previously determined "unsafe" keys. [See Document SCP-004-1]

Upon unlocking object SCP-004-3 with the "safe" key, the box opens automatically on hinges, revealing a space inside determined to be precisely five times greater than the outer dimensions. Items placed within while the lid remains open do not affect the weight, temperature, or features of the box. When the lid is closed and locked, all items inside are no longer present upon reopening. Items "disappeared" in this way are irretrievable. Personnel locked inside the box are also irretrievable, though for an unexplained reason this profoundly affects the dreams experienced by [[[SCP-640]]] subjects.

++++ Appendix C
**Date of Discovery:** 02/29/08
As part of an experiment led by Dr. ██████████, four (4) Class-D personnel were deposited into SCP-004-3 with [DATA EXPUNGED]. The box was closed, locked, and re-opened. A yellow-green band composed of an unknown rubbery-substance is found inside. The item is deemed safe and is in Dr. ██████████'s possession.

**Update:** 03/02/08
After abnormalities during testing, rubber band is re-classified [[[SCP-536| SCP-536-2]]].

**Date of Discovery:** 07/21/08

**Update:** Other half of [[[SCP-529]]] found inside SCP-004.  Tests are being run to see how the rear end of Josie the Half Cat ended up in this dimensional pocket.
