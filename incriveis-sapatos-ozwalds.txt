Warning: Das Wunderkabinnet does not offer insurance for accidents on high threat level dimensions or in the act of non-cataloged dimension exploration.

Misuse of the shoes as a weapon of physical aggression may result in the seizing and return of the product to Das Wunderkabinnet. Inappropriate use may also result in an improperly calculated teleportation of the user in the space-time continuum, causing potentially permanent physical damage to the user in many ways, including but not restricted to crushing, corporeal disintegration, compromise of molecular structure in the weave, among others.

Travels to alternate dimensions within the state of Kansas are not recommended due to sudden changes in climate.

Das Wunderkabinett does not accept rebates.
