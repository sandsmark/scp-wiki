||||~ ^^Scanned: 9-15-██. Day 1. Subject draws self with long hair, holding magic wand. Writing is for the most part grammatically correct, but lacks aesthetic quality. Presumably subject believes/wants her writing to be grammatically correct, but is unaware of problems with appearance. Transcript of text: "I can make my hair long or short now because Merlin taught me the spell!" 'Merlin' refers to Dr. Anselm, who uses the name during interaction with SCP-239, as part of maintaining the illusion of magic.^^ ||

||||~ ^^Scanned: 9-16-██. Day 2. Drawing of self writing in book. Doctor in picture not conclusively identified, as minimal personal interaction occurred on 9-16-██. Transcript of text: "I'm going to learn to write really nice." This may indicate that SCP-239's properties will cause improved writing talent. However, there is no information on the time frame that SCP-239 believes will be required to improve.^^ ||
