||||~ Experiment 239-C will consist of SCP-239 being presented with a small (30 page) blank book and a pack of 16 colored crayons. Subject will be encouraged to write and/or draw inside it daily. Entries will be electronically recorded, and hopefully used to assist with gauging and altering SCP-239's beliefs. ||

||||~ ^^Scanned: 9-15-██. Created on 9-15-██. Cover of experiment 239-C. Subject draws self holding a book and what is presumed to be a magic wand. Doctors Anselm and Pretch stand on either side. Artistic ability unremarkable; subject primarily uses pink crayon, with personal details rendered in yellow (hair, tip of wand) and light brown (book, shaft of wand). Transcript of text: "My Diary." Written large, at top of page.^^ ||

||||~ ^^Scanned: 9-15-██. Created on 9-15-██. Subject draws self with long hair, holding magic wand. Writing is for the most part grammatically correct, but lacks aesthetic quality. Presumably subject believes/wants her writing to be grammatically correct, but is unaware of problems with appearance. Transcript of text: "I can make my hair long or short now because Merlin taught me the spell!" 'Merlin' refers to Dr. Anselm, who uses the name during interaction with SCP-239, as part of maintaining SCP-239's illusion of witchcraft.^^ ||

||||~ ^^Scanned: 9-15-██. Created on 9-15-██. Basic drawing of self receiving book, most likely from Dr. Anselm. Transcript of text: "Today I got a diary! He said I should write in it like it is a person but it isn't a person."^^ ||

||||~ ^^Scanned: 9-16-██. Created on 9-16-██. Drawing of self writing in book. Doctor in picture not conclusively identified, as minimal personal interaction occurred on 9-16-██. Transcript of text: "I'm going to learn to write really nice." This may indicate that SCP-239's properties will cause improved writing talent. However, there is no information on the time frame that SCP-239 believes will be required to improve.^^ ||

She enchanted my chair so" Subject displays difficulty with the word 'enchanted.' Ramifications on theory of 239's belief in correct grammar are unknown. Writing continued on next page.^^ ||

||||~ ^^Scanned: 9-17-██. Created on 9-17-██. Self portrait using provided crayons and the 'magic' black crayon. Far higher quality than former drawings. This may either be due to SCP-239's belief that the crayon was magical or SCP-239's desire to create a higher quality drawing.^^ ||

||||~ ^^Scanned: 9-21-██. Created on 9-19-██. Drawing of Dr. Wyatt with excessively long hair and magic wand. Transcript of text: "She came back! Merlin was surprised I think." Dr. Wyatt reappeared inside SCP-239-C's containment area on 9-19-██ at 1:52 pm. Dr. Wyatt believed herself to be a witch, and displayed abilities equivalent to SCP-239's beliefs of what a 'powerful witch' should be able to do. Removal of Dr. Wyatt from SCP-239's presence deemed too risky to occur while SCP-239 was conscious.^^ ||

||||~ ^^Scanned: 9-21-██. Created on 9-19-██. Drawing of self beside doctors Anselm and Wyatt. Transcript of text: "She is going to teach me more spells! Merlin said we have to wait for tomorrow." The risk of SCP-239 indirectly using Dr. Wyatt to bypass its emplaced beliefs on limited magical ability necessitated immediate intervention. Once SCP-239 was asleep, Dr. Wyatt was removed from her presence. SCP-239 was then woken, and successfully convinced that Dr. Wyatt was an 'evil witch' who had attempted to steal SCP-239's power. Dr. Wyatt subsequently terminated. Silhouette on background of scanned page unidentified, does not appear in book.^^ ||

||||~ Experiment 239-C successfully recovered on 9-21-██. Further experimentation canceled due to application of medically induced coma. Experiment 239-C may or may not be continued should SCP-239 be returned to consciousness. Project on hold as of 10-03-██. ||
