**Full Name:** Giovanni Primus

**Clearance:** Level 4

**Position:** Head Researcher, Site 55 Scientific Department

**Bio:** Dr. Primus is a ██ year old male, with his doctorate in Aerospace Engineering. He has been described as eccentric, but dedicated - although many around Site 55 have admitted to some concern for his sanity. 

**Employment History:** Dr. Primus has only been with the Foundation for a short amount of time, being assigned to SCP-2917 only shortly after Event 2917-A. He was directly involved in the reconstruction of Site 37, but only a few months later was assigned to Site 55, as the researcher in charge of a few Safe-class anomalies. Dr. Primus climbed the chain of command abnormally quickly, eventually being promoted to his current position as Site 55's head researcher.

This shouldn't take all that long, so click through some of the tabs below, and let me know if you like what you see! I'll attach a chart of my skips here too.

So read on, and see what I have to offer! I'm excited to know what you think.

**[[[SCP-2917]]]: Twice-Stable Wormhole**

This was my first SCP.

I'd been reading the site for about three years, more or less, before I finally decided to create an account and try my hand at writing my own skip. Went through the incredibly valuable guides, registered, made a sandbox page, and started writing.

The idea started out as a kind of a horror thing - exploring the concept of being left, stranded and alone, on an alien world with zero chance of rescue.

This is not what got published.

That's mostly because I'm not a good enough author to deal with putting much emotion into my work. I can totally nail the specifics, which is important - I can make a skip look like a plausible piece of technical writing - but actual emotion and personality is something I can't easily do. It's one of my limitations.

Then I started exploring some more stuff. The focus was now on meticulous study - on the Foundation working out exactly how this thing works, what it does, and what makes it suddenly shift its target planet. I published that.

And it got some wonderful criticism. I'm not being sarcastic, it was really good critique. I published a rewrite about a week or two later, but at that point nobody saw it because it had moved off of the "new pages" list. If you read it back then, I'd advise you go take another look. Maybe I turned a downvote into an upvote somewhere!

**[[[SCP-2597]]]: Minus Two Kilograms**

My second and most popular SCP.

This one has a bit of a story with it. It had, at this point, been about a month since I published 2597. I wanted to write another skip, but I just couldn't come up with a viable concept. I played around with a pen that makes anything you write with it true within a certain radius, but then I was alerted to something very similar - and it was an 001 proposal.

Anyway, I got bored in physics class. I started thinking back to some really basic stuff - namely Newton's Second Law. I started contemplating what I knew about forces and what would happen if you messed around with some weird numbers.

An object with infinite mass would just sit there. Also it would turn into a black hole, but what fun is that?

An object with zero mass would, interestingly enough, resist motion as well, as long as it was in atmosphere. If there was any force at all on all sides, it's a balanced force. You can't get it to move relative to earth, because there's always some teensy atmospheric pressure opposing you. If you had it in space though, it would accelerate to C instantly and then keep going - at least until it touched a neutrino.

An object with negative mass though... that could be fun. That could be an SCP. I could write that.

And I did. I was meticulous. I put a lot of thought and energy into making sure I had the physics as right as I could make them, and then wrote it up, had it reviewed, and posted it. [https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.155301 Then this happened.] I kinda lost it. The amazing science aside, I'd written an SCP and had something resembling it exist in real life within two days. Seriously?

Then it got featured. This was basically the best possible scenario. I had more publicity than I could've imagined as a second-time SCP author. Frankly I had no idea that this was that original of a concept - I just thought it'd be fun. Apparently loads of other people did too.

Seriously, thank you all so much. That said, there's pretty much zero chance I can top this.

**[[[SCP-2649]]]: Multidimensional Ceramic Omnivore**

This one's a bit different. The page about the spidery teapot monster you see here started with just this image. An SCP fuel post on Reddit.

I initially wanted to give it a compulsion effect, but those are lame, so I didn't. I also initially had a test log where somebody drank the portal fluid, and anything they ate or drank went into the pocket dimension and fed the skip instead of the Class D. I liked that log, but I couldn't work out why the hell the Foundation would have someone drink it, so I scrapped it.

The concept of it cleverly trying to escape and making a pain in the rear of itself developed towards the end, and I could probably stand to add something there. Maybe eventually it'll get a rewrite. I dunno.

There's really not all that much else to say, really. I had a concept for what this thing would do, and I rolled with it. It's not my best - but if you ask me it ain't bad. Pretty hard to follow up my last one, although if you check my sandbox page I've got something in the works that might pull it off.
