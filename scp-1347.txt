**Item #:** SCP-1347

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1347 is to be kept in a standard containment storage unit with two (2) different sets of locks. Each set is to require a key card and a password. The passwords and the keys are to be kept separately by the Head Researcher (currently Dr.Thane) of the object and his assistant of minimum Level 3 security clearance. The passwords are to be changed weekly and are not to be shared under any circumstances, even between the two (2) password-holders. Failure to comply with the protocol is a ground for a severe disciplinary action.

Despite its lack of anomalous properties when not in active state, the object is not to be kept with other low-maintenance SCP objects. It is to be kept isolated and must be guarded at all times by two (2) armed security personnel who are oblivious to its nature. They are to obstruct any unauthorized personnel attempting to approach the object, with termination permitted if no other option is available to prevent insertion of an unauthorized inquiry.

All testing involving this object require direct approval of the Head Researcher regarding the request for the testing. The request submitted must contain the exact wordings of the inquiry that would be inserted into the SCP, the intention of the said inquiry and a hypothesis of SCP's reply. The Head Researcher is recommended to oversee every testing of the object. When an Event-2 occurs, the researcher in charge of the particular testing is to inform the Head Researcher immediately should he not be overseeing it.

In case of an occurrence of Event-2, Mobile Task Force Psi-13 is to cease their current assignment, if any, and to be fully committed to ascertaining the nature of the event by any possible means necessary unless otherwise commanded.

**Description:** SCP-1347 is a box of dimensions 20.0x20.0x20.0 (cm) that bears a close resemblance to a typical suggestion box. There is a 7.0x1.0 (cm) slit at the top side which serves as an opening for inquiries to be inserted through and the bottom side functions as the lid for retrieval of the replies. Written above the slit is a phrase "All answers are born from questions."

The object was acquired from [REDACTED], in ██-██-20██, following a lead by a planted agent at the location. The owner of the object, who had been using it as a mean to accomplish his academic assignments, was administered Class-B Amnesiac.

Any writing of inquisitive nature inserted into SCP-1347 is henceforth referred to as an ‘inquiry’. Any answer given by the object to the inquiry is henceforth referred to as a ‘reply’.

The anomalous effect of the object is triggered only when an inquiry is inserted into it via the aforementioned slit. Every inquiry inserted will cause either an Event-1 or Event-2 to occur. The determining factors in an occurrence of Event-1 or -2 are the nature and the complexity of the inquiry.

When the inquiry is sufficiently simple, Event-1 occurs. In an Event-1, a reply appears beside the inquiry within ten(10) minutes after an insertion of inquiry and no further anomalous incidents take place. If the writing material containing the inquiry lacks the surface to fully contain the reply, writing material of identical chemical make-up will be produced by unknown means. SCP-1347 gives a reply to every inquiry, regardless of the inquiry’s nature. The Event-1 will occur to both mundane, opinion-based inquiries such as "What's good for dinner?" as well as inquiries that require some degree of specialized knowledge but are simple to calculate, such as "What is the maximum range for the ██████-███ for it to retain a minimum of 90% accuracy and 100% lethality, assuming no course deviation of the bullet due to drag force by the air currents or gravitational force acting on it?"

An occurrence of Event-2 takes place when the inquiry inserted is adequately complex or is considered thought-provoking in general. Personnel are to assume that an Event-2 is in progress if a reply fails to appear within ten (10) minutes after the insertion of inquiry.

Event-2 is a situation in which SCP-1347 manipulates the events in real world to perform an experiment, utilizing any possible method available, which will provide it with the information to solve the inquiry. Depending on the nature of the input, the resultant Event-2 experimentation varies. Once the experiment is over, the reply will appear in an identical manner to that in Event-1. In all Event-2s, the effects caused by the object are removed partially, by means both explicable and inexplicable, after a week of completion of the experimentation.

SCP-1347 seems to learn from every inquiry. At the moment of this report, it is deemed to possess intelligence slightly above the mean of general populace, although exact measurement of its intelligence level is impeded due to its non-human nature.

Due to the potentially catastrophic nature of Event-2s, all personnel are advised to avoid inserting inquiries likely to trigger an Event-2. It is strictly forbidden to insert an inquiry into SCP-1347 that refers to paradoxes or time travel, or mentions the Foundation in any method and form.

**Note:** //I want all who work on this SCP to discard the belief that we are working with a simple object here. I'm pretty sure there's some sort of an entity behind it; a consciousness that causes the experiments to happen and replies to us through the box. Therefore, do not be alarmed when the reply to your inquiry seems a little informal. In fact, start worrying if it is formal. Generally, we take that as a sign the entity is unhappy with you.// - Dr. Thane

**Inquiry:** What is your purpose?
**Occurred Event:** Event-1
**Reply:** I answer questions.

**Inquiry:** What's good for dinner? 
**Occurred Event:** Event-1
**Reply:** You are asking a box about dining? I think a tomato stew would be a fabulous idea.
**Note:** It was generally agreed by the Site staff that the tomato stew that evening was fantastic.

**Inquiry:** What is the current location of Mobile Task Force - ████ ██?
**Fact of Interest:** This inquiry was inserted prior to the prohibition of Foundation-related inquiries.
**Occurred Event:** Event-1
**Reply:** They are gone, mate. Might wanna send some clean-up to [REDACTED].
**Note:** Mobile Task Force - ████ ██ was found killed by SCP-███ at the location.

**Inquiry:** What do you know of Eros, the mythological entity?
**Occurred Event:** Event-1
**Reply:** Son of Aphrodite and much better known as Cupid, his Roman counterpart. Other than having the golden arrows of love, he also had the bronze arrows of hatred, as Apollo had learned the hard way.
**Note:** Error in knowledge regarding the mythology was noted.

**Inquiry:** How can we obtain an infinite source of energy?
**Occurred Event:** Event-2
**Nature of Event-2:** [REDACTED] was engulfed by a continuous explosion of vast amount of energy. Despite the fact such amount of energy should have spilled over to the surrounding environment, the explosion was contained in the radius of 5 km of the hypo-center. Upwards of █ exajoules of energy was measured over the period of one week. After the week, the explosion ceased and its source disappeared. Reply produced after the cessation.
**Reply:** I really, really got close but can't do it successfully. Try asking again in the future.
**Note:** Object reclassified from Safe to Euclid.
 
**Inquiry:** How can we save Agent ████?
**Occurred Event:** Event-2
**Nature of Event-2:** The memetic effect of SCP-████ acting on Agent ████ began to subside. Medical personnel on scene immediately began treatment. Agent ████ rescued.
**Reply:** Ugh, where did you even find this stuff? This cognitohazard is nasty. Anyway, since this seems to [DATA EXPUNGED] that's all you got to do.
**Note:** After a week from that incident, the agent reexperienced the memetic effects, although at a lessened degree. Minor containment breach occurred. 

**Inquiry:** How good is Dr. Ashe in bed?
**Occurred Event:** Event-2
**Nature of Event-2:** Occurrence of Event-2 was assumed when the reply failed to appear within the ten(10) minutes time frame. However, the nature of Event-2 was undetermined until the day after when it was revealed Dr. Ashe had enjoyed a one-night-stand with a stranger she had chanced upon in her favorite bar. She was able to describe the incident but not the person. Dr. Ashe was not impregnated.
**Reply:** My friend, you have no idea. Words can't describe it.
**Note:** //Sucks to be Dr.Gene, I guess. His crush just got banged by someone -- something -- else because of him. I never expected this when I permitted this inquiry. Some interesting details we got here. Dr.Ashe is not to be informed of this testing.// - Dr.Thane

**Inquiry:** What is the nature of SCP-████?
**Occurred Event:** Event-2
**Fact of Interest:** This inquiry was inserted prior to the prohibition of Foundation-related inquiries.
**Nature of Event-2:** Containment breach of SCP-████. SCP-████ did not pose any harm to Foundation personnel with exception of Dr. Gene. Succesful determination of anomalous property of SCP-████. After the documentation of its anomalous properties, SCP-████ returned to containment.
**Reply:** So this thing basically does [DATA EXPUNGED]. By the way, that bastard had that coming.
**Note-1:** It is noteworthy that this testing occurred after a failed attempt by Dr.Gene to neutralize the object following the precedent test. He had been replaced by Dr.Teo and awaiting relocation when terminated.
**Note-2:** Dr.Teo requested prohibition of Foundation-related inquiries for future tests on grounds of sensitive information and potential containment breaches by SCP-1347. Request approved.

**Inquiry:**What is my next question?
**Occurred Event:** Event-2
**Nature of Event-2:**No reply was produced until the next inquiry was submitted.
**Reply:** What took you so long? The answer is 'What is your opinion of Aleister Crowley and his works?'
**Note:** The object was concluded non-omniscient and lacking cognitive or telepathic abilities.

**Inquiry:** What is your opinion of Aleister Crowley and his works?
**Occurred Event:** Event-2
**Nature of Event-2:** A personal copy of biography of Aleister Crowley owned by the researcher, which happened to be an original copy by the author, disappeared.  Further investigation revealed that the original copies of biography of Aleister Crowley done by other authors had disappeared as well. Some of the copies reappeared after a week.
**Reply:** The reply was a thirty-four(34) pages long biography of Aleister Crowley. When compared with the pre-existing copies of biography of Aleister Crowley, the details were similar. New information regarding the man not contained in any biographies was also contained within the reply. 

**Inquiry:** What did I dream about last night?
**Fact of Interest:** The inquiry was requested by Dr.█████ with the claim that remembrance of his dream was of a vital information to the Foundation. Due to possibility of relation with dream-based SCPs, the request was approved.
**Occurred Event:** Event-2
**Nature of Event-2:**Upon insertion of inquiry, Dr.█████ immediately entered comatose state. Medical inspection determined that he was undergoing REM sleep. Dr.█████'s neural pattern was often similar to those displayed during state of stress. After four(4) weeks in comatose state, Dr.█████ expired from a sudden cardiac arrest.
**Reply:** [DATA EXPUNGED]
**Note:** The reply led to the discovery and containment of SCP-████.

**Inquiry:** How could the problem of poverty in ████████ be solved?
**Occurred Event:** Event-2
**Nature of Event-2:** A massacre occurred in ████████. Total of █,███,███ causalities were recorded from the genocide, which was the ██% of the population. Majority of the causalities were those in poverty-stricken region. When UN Peacekeeping Force intervened and put end to the massacre, the reply appeared.
**Reply:** Well, one way to do it is to kill them off. Harsh but true.
**Note:** A week after the massacre, the number of immigrants into the country massively increased, restoring the population size to roughly 64.4% of its original value. The national GDP of the country only experienced 5.42% drop compared to before the Event-2 despite the casualties. The Gini-coefficient fell by 0.25 compared to before. All media across the world lost interest of the genocide almost simultaneously. 
Dr.██████ refused amnesiac administration and required seventeen months of psychological therapy before being considered fit to return to work.

This addendum addresses the most frequent question Dr. Thane faces from personnel who have read on SCP-1347.

> I've had quite enough of my superiors and my --inferiors-- assistants asking why this SCP is not utilized in a way that would benefit the foundation in a larger scale. //Dr. Thane? Why is this SCP not used as a mean to discover and sabotage enemy intel? Sir, Why do we not use this to find out how to destroy other Keter-Class SCPs? Hey, Thane, Don't you think SCP-1347 would be a great way to [DATA EXPUNGED]?// Do you really think I have not thought of all these? This is not a Safe-Class SCP, people. I have five(5) good reasons not to use this in such manners.
> 
> * The effect of Event-2 is beyond our control. Look at how Dr. Gene [REDACTED] right before our eyes. Did we want that? This could happen at any time and we would not be able to predict nor prevent it. Just because we can trigger Event-2 does not mean we can make it work the way we want it to.
> 
> * This thing is sapient and near omnipotent, limited only by our lack of inputs. What if it decides one day it does not want to be in the care of the Foundation any longer? It may modify one of its experiments to //coincidentally// result in a containment breach of it. Event-2 of large scales are more likely to allow this to happen.
> 
> * Any changes we cause using this can return in a week's time. Imagine if this thing succeeds in neutralizing the Keter-Class SCPs; in a week, they may return, but will likely not be in a contained condition. Potential containment breaches are to be avoided.
> 
> * Once the GOIs get a hint of this thing, they will be onto us like a group of vultures on a roadkill. The more we use this in a large scale, the more likely its existence is discovered by them. The best method to protect it is to keep it incognito. Under no circumstances can we let this fall into a GOI's hands.
> 
> * 05-██ agrees with my first four reasons. 
> 
> Therefore, do not ask me about using SCP-1347 for some grand project of yours. The SCP-1347 is not a magic lamp with a genie within.
> 
> - Dr. Thane, Head Researcher of SCP-1347.
