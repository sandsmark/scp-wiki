**Item #:** SCP-3257

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3257 is to be kept in a secure item locker at [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-77|Site-77]]]. All SCP-3257-B instances are to be kept in a cryonic storage chamber at Site-77. Personnel are required to don Class I biological hazard attire when engaging in experiments involving SCP-3257-B's interaction with SCP-3257. 

To facilitate experiments involving SCP-3257-B's interaction with the Sistine Chapel or interviews with SCP-3257-A, Provisional Experiment Room 3257 (PER-3257) has been established underneath the Sistine Chapel in collaboration with the Holy See and City Council of Rome. PER-3257 is to be equipped with a ventilation system. PER-3257 is to be accessed via underground tunnels in Rome, Italy. Approval for the use of PER-3257 is to be obtained from the Holy See Liaison to the Foundation. Following the conclusion of experiments and interviews, SCP-3257-B is to be returned to Site-77. 

**Description:** SCP-3257 is a silver-coloured plastic suitcase. A label on SCP-3257 lists its destination as the Sistine Chapel in the State of the Vatican City. The interior of SCP-3257 is pitch black, and has a depth of five centimetres from the latch. 

SCP-3257-A is a consciousness attached to SCP-3257, represented by vocalisations produced when SCP-3257 is opened. However, SCP-3257-A cannot perceive stimuli introduced to SCP-3257. Languages of SCP-3257's vocalisations are in Bambara, French and Latin.

SCP-3257-B refers to the reconstructed body of Dominique Dubois, a Roman Catholic priest of French-Malian descent who is currently declared missing following a surprise attack by jihadist organisation █████ on ██/██/2013. [[footnote]] Notably, no other casualties or missing persons were reported in the incident. No calls for ransom were made by █████. Attackers have also left a sum of €5,000,000 (in bank notes) at the location where Dubois was last sighted at. Bank notes were scattered haphazardly on the floor. [[/footnote]] Although it has no physiological differences with a human body, the organs in SCP-3257-B are non-functional. When initially recovered, SCP-3257-B was fragmented into an assortment of bone fragments, pieces of skin, and pieces of various organs (see **Recovery**). SCP-3257-B displays two sets of anomalous traits when in proximity to either SCP-3257 or the Sistine Chapel respectively. 

Any fragment of SCP-3257-B (regardless of size) can be placed in SCP-3257 entirely, consistently disappearing from view as the fragment enters SCP-3257. Additionally, SCP-3257-B does not contribute to the total mass of SCP-3257 and its contents. These effects are not applicable to objects that are not SCP-3257-B, including objects attached to SCP-3257-B fragments. 

If SCP-3257 is opened while fragments of SCP-3257-B are inside, said fragments will be ejected from SCP-3257 at an average velocity of 3.5 m/s. Said velocity increases exponentially when the volume of SCP-3257-B fragments in SCP-3257 is more than the volume of SCP-3257. During which, ejected fragments will sustain further fragmentation. 

In the Sistine Chapel, fragments of SCP-3257-B will levitate autonomously and attach to one another to reconstruct Dubois' body. To that end, fragments will undergo cell growth to repair damage sustained on various fragments. Simultaneously, non-anomalous white smoke [[footnote]] In relation to the Sistine Chapel, white smoke emitted during a papal conclave denotes the successful election of a new Pope. [[/footnote]] is spontaneously generated. The volume of white smoke generated increases when more fragments of SCP-3257-B are in the Sistine Chapel. 

Additionally, while in the Sistine Chapel, stimuli introduced to SCP-3257-B are perceived by SCP-3257-A. This is used to facilitate two-way communications between Foundation personnel and SCP-3257-A through SCP-3257-B. The following is a summary of statements made by SCP-3257-A: 

* Attributes its current situation to a prayer to become Pope of the Roman Catholic Church following Pope Benedict XVI's resignation on 28/02/2013.
* Intends to take on the papal name 'Alexander V', describing it as a term it heard following the aforementioned prayer via an unknown source. 
* Believes that it is currently a human contorted to be able to fit inside SCP-3257 en route to the Sistine Chapel.
* Asserts that it will emerge from SCP-3257 upon arrival intact and without damaging itself and its surroundings.

**Recovery:** SCP-3257 was found in Timbuktu, Mali on ██/██/2013. It was originally held by █████ members, who were killed while protecting the object. Under the assumption that it contained materials regarding █████'s operations in Northern Mali, SCP-3257 was opened by members of the Malian National Police. Upon opening, SCP-3257 released SCP-3257-B fragments at high speeds, resulting in █ fatalities and ██ injuries. Following reports of vocalisations produced from SCP-3257, the Foundation intercepted the object. 

**Addendum 3257-1:** Cardinal █████ █████, Holy See Liaison to the Foundation (hereon referred to as PoI-32125), vetoed the use of the Sistine Chapel unless SCP-3257 and all fragments of SCP-3257-B are simultaneously brought into the Sistine Chapel during the Papal conclave of 2013. [[footnote]] Liaisons to the Foundation are granted Level 0 security clearance. [[/footnote]] Due to potential compromise to papal succession, PoI-32125's ultimatum was denied. 

Following the election of Pope Francis on 13/03/2013, PoI-32125 withdrew his veto and authorised the creation of PER-3257. He also issued an apology to Site-77 Director for his veto, and resigned from his positions in the Roman Catholic Church. In both cases, PoI-32125 cited hallucinations of being asphyxiated by white smoke to have adversely affected his decision-making. 

As of ██/██/2014, PoI-32125 has been sighted in ██ locations in the Southern United States, which are associated with the [[[fifthist-hub|Fifth Church]]]. Pending further investigations.
