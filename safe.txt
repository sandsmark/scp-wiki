||||Label for SCP objects designated to the "Safe" classification  ||
[[/div]]

The designation "Safe" is assigned to subjects that do not display any active hostility to human life, civilization, or the space-time continuum. Safe designates do not commonly require special containment procedures beyond proper storage and cataloging.

Some Safe designates are human, humanoid, and/or sentient. To prevent injury and/or death to personnel and SCPs, interaction with such designates should be professional and courteous, taking into account special containment procedures.
