//The more things change, the more they stay the same.
And that which man thinks he knows best
Might have been different before he came.
Ancient stories, once lain to rest.//

Were those stories wrong?

Everything has a story; you, me, the monsters, all of us. Some stories are never told. Some desperately need to be.
