//The more things change, the more they stay the same.
And that which man thinks he knows best
Might have been different before he came.
Ancient stories, once lain to rest.//

[[/=]]

I'm sure you've been around long enough to hear the stories. Ancient beings from impossible worlds. Dragons and Behemoths, fueled only by hatred. Uncomprehendable horrors hiding behind innocent faces.

Were those stories wrong?

Everything has a story; you, me, the monsters, all of us. Some stories are never told. Some desperately need to be.

++ SCP-053/Quarseta-ql-Paneu
One of our story's main protagonists. Thirteen years have passed, and she now has the form and heart of a sixteen year old girl. However, looks can be deceiving, as her soul is that of something far older. Generally kind character, both to humans and to her companions, but doesn't quite seem to get that there's anything wrong with death.

++ SCP-682/Atanti-ql-Paneu
The Hard-To-Destroy reptile himself. Sees humanity as very, //very//, wrong and feels compelled to get rid of it when possible. Acts like a lizardy combination of a grandpa and Aslan towards 053. Acts like a bitter war veteran towards the other denizens of the previous iteration.

++ SCP-1129/Edrisek-tsa-Fanu
A fairly quiet character (as in, they can't talk) who's communications and actions are described through descriptions of visuals. Simple thinking with a disinterested attitude towards humans. Serves as a means of transport and protection for 053 and 682. Also serves to make things happen in the background.

++ SCP-303/Evuruct-rru-Kirge
Portrayed as a crotchety combination of an old hermit and mad scientist. Misses the family he lost during the change in iterations and seeks to recreate them.

++ SCP-173/Koitern
A very bad man in the previous iteration. He is both dangerous, a savage dictator, and a madman. Singlehandedly waged genocide on about 1/3 of 682's countrymen in the past iteration.

[[collapsible show="+ Concept for the Series" hide="- Concept for the Series"]]

This series ties up all the big, terrifying, eldritch, inhuman SCPs and anomalies in one ball... and makes them relatable. Not that they aren't still eldritch and terrifying, but they are presented in such a way that human readers (which make up the majority of our base) can relate to them, personality, backstory, and all the rest.

A good chunk of the anomalies in the SCiPverse are survivors of the massive reality-altering event which destroyed the previous iteration of the multiverse and replaced it with the current one. The reality of previous iteration was slightly more flexible and volatile, not suitable for your vanilla human, but its inhabitants seemed to like it just fine.

Your Tale should fall into one of two categories:

+++ Tales of the Travelers
These tales will detail the adventures of Quarseta, Atanti, tsa-Fanu, and whatever guest skips you'd like. The main storyline consists of our protagonists attempting to find a way back into the previous iteration of reality, but they may have a few side adventures as well.

+++ Tales of the Old Lands
What on sf'esxdf' was the old iteration like?! Who were the celebrities and commoners? What were our characters lives like back then? What were the politics and customs? A set of slice of life Tales which cover these questions and more.

Before writing your Tale, please read the existing works in the series. While writing, make sure to keep your characters relatable. Before posting, please send your draft to [[user DreamwalkerFae]] for critique and an okay, and don't forget to get feedback from other members in advance!
