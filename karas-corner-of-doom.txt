What do Karas do? We’re very unsure.

We know that he enjoys art, music, and occasionally fire. Possibly avian in nature? Though, he has shown signs of being a cat, and a human. Probably a shapeshifter. --Contain at all costs.-- To never be contained.

He had an odd quote he keeps carving into everything. We understand nothing about this weird creature.

//”Capitalism is a lie and so is Communism.”//

He has ruined 40 desks.

Hello Hello!

I’m Kara! 

No, no. Sit down, and shut up. Leaving is illegal, and there will be --appropriate-- lethal force taken to ensure you stay in this room.

So, about me…

I somehow managed to get an author page, so uh, yay!!! I have a [http://www.scp-wiki.net/kara-s-page-of-art cool art page] I guess? Gonna try and break it soon! I write mostly tales here on this wiki. So, I guess if you want those you could scroll down. Maybe? 

In the meantime, I like [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/bird Team Bird] WAY too much and I’ve read everything over like 5 almost 6 times now. Same with Parks and Recreation, but I’ve watched that show about 50 times over and have almost all of the script memorized. Did you know that I also hold a 2nd place speed run time for SCP-022? 

Aside from my bragging, we should get into things ACTUALLY about me. I’m 17, He/Her (Pick a binary pronoun and go with it.), in marching band, jazz band, and concert band. I play bassoon, piano, and synth. We here in Texas love our football, but I just enjoy marching band. I have made region band 3 times, and honestly if you get me talking about band I may never shut up! 


As you could probably tell I really like doing art. Did I mention my art page yet?!?

“Yeah, like 2 times now.” 

Well, fuck you too then!

“That's it?” 

Don’t like it? Wait a month or five, there might be more! Or not, I don’t know…

In the time between, go read some of these wonderful peoples’ work!

[[*user Lt Flops]] is an amazing author, she has almost 50 pages on this wiki. She’s really kind and a great person no matter where you talk to her. She's really cool and very good at writing. (Plus she let me steal her code from her author page, so, she's more cooler now.)

Also, [[*user not_a_seagull]] is a favorite of mine. He's really cool, and funny, or whatever. He too has almost 50 pages on the wiki, and Notagull and Flooooopy worked on Team Bird together, yet another reason I love these two! If you don’t like his work you are my enemy due to the amount of greatness he exudes. Just go read and updoot his stuff.

Also also!! You should go over to [[*user Calibri Bold]]’s stuff. He’s really cool and kind, very caring if you’re one of his friends, even if you’re not he’s just great! Really good at writing too, around 20 pages here onsite, so go take a look and leave an updoot or two! (If you don’t like him, I’ll use my totally --non-- lethal force to delete you.) I absolutely love ALL of his work, so I may be one of his biggest fans. He also wrote the code for the SCP listings. (He totally did not bully me into using it…)

Wait, one more thing!

> If life happens, and I decide to leave the site, I die, or I otherwise don't exist for 4 years, without anyone knowing about my whereabouts and having the ability to contact me, then I wish for [[*user Lt Flops]] to take ownership of all of my articles (aside from collaborations, which go to their co-authors), and all matters of deletion, porting and licensing are to be forwarded to her.

> The Team Bird Art Page is a special case and should be handled by the Team Bird Team ([[*user not_a_seagull]], [[*user Lt Flops]], [[*user Ayers]], and [[*user Quantum Physician]]) They’re great people and I have trust in them (Maybe too much.)

That's it. Go home, you can not stay here!
