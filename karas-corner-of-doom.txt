What do Karas do? We’re very unsure.

We know that he enjoys art, music, and occasionally fire. Possibly avian in nature? Though, he has shown signs of being a cat, and a human. Probably a shapeshifter. --Contain at all costs.-- To never be contained.

He had an odd quote he keeps carving into everything. We understand nothing about this weird creature.

//”Capitalism is a lie and so is Communism.”//

He has ruined 40 desks.

Hello Hello!

I’m Kara! 

No, no. Sit down, and shut up. Leaving is illegal, and there will be --appropriate-- lethal force taken to ensure you stay in this room.

So, about me…

I somehow managed to get an author page, so uh, yay!!! I have a [http://www.scp-wiki.net/kara-s-page-of-art cool art page] I guess? Gonna try and break it soon! I write mostly tales here on this wiki. So, I guess if you want those you could scroll down. Maybe? 

In the meantime, I like [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/bird Team Bird] WAY too much and I’ve read everything over like 5 almost 6 times now. Same with Parks and Recreation, but I’ve watched that show about 50 times over and have almost all of the script memorized. Did you know that I also hold a 2nd place speed run time for SCP-022? 

Aside from my bragging, we should get into things ACTUALLY about me. I’m 17, he/him, in marching band, jazz band, and concert band. I play bassoon, piano, and synth. We here in Texas love our football, but I just enjoy marching band. I have made region band 3 times, and honestly if you get me talking about band I may never shut up! 


As you could probably tell I really like doing art. Did I mention my art page yet?!?

“Yeah, like 2 times now.” 

Well, fuck you too then!

“That's it?” 

Don’t like it? Wait a month or five, there might be more! Or not, I don’t know…


In the time between, go read some of [[*user Lt Flops]] stuff, she's really cool and very good at writing. (Plus she let me steal her code from her author page, so, she's more cooler now.)

Also, go read some of [[*user not_a_seagull]]’s stuff. He's really cool, or whatever. and if you don’t like his work you are my enemy.

Wait, one more thing!

> If life happens, and I decide to leave the site, I die, or I otherwise don't exist for 4 years, without anyone knowing about my whereabouts and having the ability to contact me, then I wish for [[*user Lt Flops]] (you may remember her from higher up.) to take ownership of all of my articles (aside from collaborations, which go to their co-authors), and all matters of deletion, porting and licensing are to be forwarded to her.

> The Team Bird Art Page is a special case and should be handled by the Team Bird Team ([[*user not_a_seagull]], [[*user Lt Flops]], [[*user Ayers]], and [[*user Quantum Physician]]) They’re great people and I have trust in them (Maybe too much.)

That's it. Go home, you can not stay here!
