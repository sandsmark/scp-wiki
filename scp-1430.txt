title:SCP-1430
**Object #:** SCP-1430

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special containment procedures:** SCP-1430 is to be stored in a security code locked, upright, opaque container that allows no rotational movement of any kind. Presently held in Sector 28.

**Object Description:** SCP-1430 is a ceremonial mace resembling a staff carved from the wood of a Douglas Fir tree, measuring nearly exactly 115.57 cm (45.5 in) from end to end, and weighing anywhere between 1.3 and 3.2 kg (the weight of SCP-1430 is believed to fluctuate as a byproduct of its unique properties. The weights listed are the highest and lowest recorded, but mathematical models suggest they may have a range from 340 grams to 6.1 kg). Adorning the top is the seal of the University of ████████, the original location of the object's retrieval, the figure of a adult male breaking away from chains, presumably the “bonds of ignorance” described in an associated recovered document, as well as a woman holding a [REDACTED] emits faint visible light when in low light conditions, or exposed to certain chelating agents.

The most immediately obvious anomalous behavior of SCP-1430 is that it retains its rotational orientation unless a torque is applied, as if it were gyroscopically stabilized. The amount of force required to rotate SCP-1430 past an initial position is fairly constant, though increases proportionally to the speed of its rotation. One subject described rotating SCP-1430 as “like swinging a baseball bat underwater”. Additionally, the faint light emitted from the top of SCP-1430 increases in intensity proportional to speed, from virtually unnoticeable unless in little to no light, to roughly the intensity “of a dim flashlight”. SCP-1430 does not exhibit these properties if moved without rotation.

When SCP-1430 is held by a subject, they report being filled with a compulsion to speak on an academic subject they are well-educated in. If the subject lacks a formal secondary or higher education, they will instead feel compelled to speak on a subject that they personally believe themselves to be knowledgeable on. Virtually all subjects were compelled to speak after ten minutes of continuous exposure, and once a subject has begun speaking, they will continue to do so regardless of bodily requirements, ignoring hunger, dehydration, etc. Chosen topics of speech have included abstract mathematics, molecular biology, “jerry-rigging”, military tactics, the construction and use of shanks, religious studies, and “gettin’ them █████ ███ ████”. This effect extends to subjects who would normally not choose to speak publicly, including self described introverts, and after sufficient exposure even psychologically traumatized subjects who, under normal circumstances would be effectively mute, will speak (though with a stilted, “unpracticed” or “unnatural” voice).


After approximately one and a half hours of continuous speaking however, the subject’s dialogue will slowly drift away from their original topic, and relate towards Methodist Christianity, regardless of the subject’s knowledge of the religion. Eventually, the subject will speak on the topic of Methodism, specifically the teachings of one Rev. Dr. ████████, of the University of ████████, where the object was originally recovered. At this point, it is still safe to remove SCP-1430 from the subject without permanent psychological damage, however they may actively resist being separated from the object.

After four to five hours of uninterrupted exposure, however, the subject will cease speaking on topics pertaining to Methodist Christianity, and instead lapse into describing a previously undocumented religion featuring violent, sacrificial rites and practices. At this point, separating SCP-1430 from the subject will cause permanent psychological and neurological damage.

**Test 1430-01**
**Subject:** Dr. W██████
**Duration:** 20 minutes
**Result:** Dr. W██████ gave a brief explanation of primate neurology and meme theory, the subject of her graduate thesis while attending university. Released SCP-1430 willingly on the request of researchers, though commented that she “wished she felt that confident seven years ago”.

**Test 1430-02**
**Subject:** Dr. Y████
**Duration:** 45 minutes
**Result:** Subject spent the duration describing his tenure at the SCP Foundation and how he acquired it, including details on his studies of SCP-███, ███, ████, and ███. At the 45 minute mark, when asked by researchers to set down SCP-1430, subject initially resisted, claiming he “hadn’t even gotten to how he [REDACTED]”, but relinquished after repeated verbal commands. Afterwards, subject expressed considerable distress at having openly and freely discussed classified materials. Tapes were destroyed, and individuals below the required security clearance who viewed the experiment were administered class-A amnesiacs. Dr. Y████ was not reprimanded.

//Notes: 1430 seems to override self-censorship. I suggest we don’t allow it to come in contact with anyone privy to knowledge that might be considered sensitive. -Dr. ████//

**Test 1430-05**
**Subject:** Agent H██████
**Duration:** 2 hour, 47 minutes
**Additional Info:** Agent H██████ was introduced to the SCP Foundation through non-standard channels. Because of his upbringing, he never received formal education beyond the age of 9 years of age.
**Result:** Agent H██████ spoke at length of his knowledge of combat exercises and training, as well as his experiences surviving in extremely adverse wartime conditions. After one hour and forty two minutes, subject touched on his knowledge of the Methodist church, how it related to his survival, and recommended it to the observing researchers.
By two and a half hours, Methodism was the only topic of subject’s speech. When asked to set SCP-1430 back down, subject remained unresponsive and continued speaking, even after several repeated direct orders. Security team instructed to forcibly remove subject from the test chamber. Subject actively and violently resisted having the object removed from his grip, and continued to speak despite fighting a group of 4 men armed with nonlethal weapons. As soon as subject dropped the object (as a result of being struck on the wrist), he expressed considerable confusion at his situation, claiming to not remember the previous altercation, or why he was now bruised in several places.
Agent H██████ later revealed that he had never had any experiences with the Methodist church, and was in fact raised strictly Russian Orthodox.

//Notes: That’s it, from now on we’re only allowing D-classes for experiments. If sensitive information wasn’t enough, I don’t want to risk there being permanent psychological damage from this thing. -Dr. ████//

**Test 1430-09**
**Subject:** D-25102
**Duration:** 1 hour
**Additional info:** Subject D-25102 is completely mute, as a result of having his tongue and vocal chords surgically removed eleven years ago due to oral cancer.
**Result:** D-25102 does not attempt to use sign language (his preferred language) as is expected, but instead attempts to “speak”, mouthing words with his lips, and using what remained of the muscles associated with forming speech in his mouth and larynx. Subject was allowed to continue for an hour, before being ordered to stop.
Subject expressed great agitation after releasing SCP-1430, claiming to have been able to hear his own voice again, and having spoken about the dangers of cigarette smoking for the duration. Several volunteers capable of lip reading were able to corroborate subjects’ claims about the topic of his “speech”.

**Test 1430-13**
**Subject:** D-12405
**Duration:** 5 hours
**Result:** Experiment proceeded normally for the first several hours. Subject at first spoke of setting up and executing complicated “cons” and pyramid schemes, before mentioning a long-term email scam performed on a reverend of the Methodist faith at one hour, thirty two minutes. (Note: Subject’s file indicated charges for a scam nearly identical to the one described, though the victim was not a reverend, nor a follower of any Christian doctrine at all)
After three hours, the subject is speaking entirely on the topic of Methodism, specifically referring any listeners to the (deceased) Rev. Dr. ████████ for further guidance. However, after three hours and forty seven minutes, subject’s narrative takes an unexpected turn, no longer instructing listeners to seek guidance, but instead insisting on self-mutilation, or other violent punishments for increasingly mundane “sins”, differing greatly from standard Methodist doctrine.
After 4 hours, twenty three minutes the religious acts described by the subject no longer resemble any existing or former religions, including elaborate human sacrifices to a deity named “Esiphus Enbuse” (approximate spelling), taking place in temples carved from [DATA EXPUNGED], which the subject claims can be found in every city and town in the civilized world.
When a security team was instructed to enter the testing chamber and remove SCP-1430, subject remained initially unresponsive until physical contact was made, at which point she immediately became enraged, violently resisting having SCP-1430 removed from her possession. After being forced to drop the artifact, subject collapsed into unconsciousness and was taken to medical suite 28-N.
D-12405 is currently in a vegetative state, showing brain activity consistent with a stroke victim.

**Test 1430-17**
**Subject:** D-13742
**Duration:** ██ days, 4 hours, 15 minutes
**Additional Info:** D-13742 was attached to an IV drip that allowed him to remain hydrated and fed for the duration of the experiment.
**Result:** Experiment proceeded as expected for the first several hours. Subject spoke at length about his knowledge of hotwiring luxury cars (Subject was originally incarcerated for several accounts of murder and grand theft auto), before lapsing into the expected pattern of Methodist teachings after several hours, and the unknown religion described by the previous subject in the hours following.
After 10 to 11 hours of continuous exposure, D-13742’s vocal chords began to clearly indicate stress, as the subject’s voice grows more indistinct and difficult to understand. Similarly, subject’s lips and mouth are beginning to show signs of minor cuts and other damage, suspected to be from accidental bites. At this point, while the subject’s voice is unclear, he is believed to be describing the daily rituals of the followers of Esiphus Enbuse.
After 23 hours of continuous exposure, D-13742 is effectively impossible to understand. Subject’s voice has given out entirely, and lip-reading has been rendered virtually useless because of the damage to the subject’s mouth and lips. Subject is also showing signs of sleep deprivation, including bloodshot eyes, and difficulty standing. Posture indicates heavy reliance on SCP-1430 to remain upright. Subject occasionally coughs mid “word” to spit up blood.
After ██ hours of continuous exposure, subject is showing signs of near total exhaustion, and close to losing consciousness. Then, at exactly ██ hours, ██ minutes, and ██ seconds, subject immediately stands at attention, indicating none of the fatigue present mere seconds earlier, and speaks clearly and loudly in an unknown language, despite the obvious damage to subject’s mouth and throat. The normally dim light at the top of SCP-1430 is now glowing extremely brightly, and subject has begun to gesticulate wildly with his arms. Subject’s voice is audible outside the testing chamber, rated as soundproof to 180 dB. Security team is instructed to enter the testing chamber and open fire on subject. [DATA EXPUNGED] containment procedures engaged [DATA EXPUNGED] 37 minutes later, using coordinated use of high explosives. Other than a layer of explosives residue, SCP-1430 remains undamaged. Subject D-13742 terminated.

//Notes: Following the incidents of test 1430-17, testing on SCP-1430 has been halted by site command.//
