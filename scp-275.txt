**Item#:** SCP-275


**Object Class:** Euclid


**Special Containment Procedures:** 

Subject is to be treated similarly to a normal member of staff, although she is to be denied long term access to the outside world and is restricted to a Level 2 clearance for information. A tracking module is always to be on her presence and if she displays unprovoked violent behavior towards other members of staff, she is to be incapacitated by on site gas squad, and then retained in a solid cement cell, ten (10) by ten (10) foot underground, which is only capable of being accessed by an overhead elevator, until she has reasonably calmed down.


**Description:**

SCP-275 is a woman of unknown race, although rough estimates would place a mixture of at least African-American, Eastern European and Asian bloodlines in her ancestry, discerned from observation of her physical appearance. Hair and eyes are brown, although subject prefers to dye hair a bright shade of red. Subject claims to be sixty eight (68) years of age and has proved it with her driving license and birth certificate, despite appearing to be in her early twenties. Subject is five foot, four inches (5'4) tall and weighs four hundred and twenty five pounds (425lbs), again despite having an appropriate and healthy sized figure. 

SCP-275 is perfectly normal in the fact that she needs to breath, eat and sleep. However, subject is unique in the fact that she is almost completely resistant to extreme physical trauma, various forms of radiation and extreme temperatures. There is no know record, either by our //extensive// testing, or by SCP-275s recollection, of the subjects flesh being damaged to anything more than a bruise, and her skin itself has never been pierced.

Testing has deduced that majority of mass that SCP-275 is comprised of is a large amount carbon, in addition to the regular amount human beings are made of. However, the molecular structure of the carbon within SCP-275 is wildly different than anything that has ever been recorded, being structured in way that is reminiscent of the molecular composition of diamond, only much larger and much more complex. A blood sample was only capable of being obtained through a cross experiment involving [[[SCP-073]]].

This "impenetrability" of the subject extends through the entirety of the subject, including her hair and nails. The hair of the subject is so resilient, that a single strand can be used as an extremely sharp cutting wire, with the capability to slice through steel and even titanium. Subject has claimed that her hair and nails have not been been properly cut since she was fourteen (14), just before her ability manifested itself, and that now she can only cut her hair with prolonged exposure to a high source of high, such a blowtorch, and that she must regularly wear down her nails with an angle grinder.

In addition to this, due to her physical makeup and density, her biology has been slowed as well. Subject ages at at least a fourth of the normal rate of aging, and this includes her "monthly cycle", which only occurs every six months and lasts for three to four (3 -4) weeks.

One of the more worrying things about SCP-275 is her mental state. Whether it is a hormonal imbalance brought about by her unique physiology, psychological problems from childhood, or simply a result of being immune to most punishments others would fear, subject suffers from severe anger management issues, dealing with most major problems with irrationality and violence. Regarding personality, subject is highly antagonistic and abrasive, lashing out at others with little to no provocative action on behalf of the recipients.
