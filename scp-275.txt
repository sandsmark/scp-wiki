**Item#:** SCP-275

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Subject is to be contained in two 6 m x 6 m (20 ft x 20 ft) subterranean cells, accessible only by a freestanding overhead elevator. She is allowed short term access to the communal facilities provided she behaves, and is accompanied by no fewer than four operatives, all armed with gas grenades filled with an incapacitating agent.

Personnel are not to respond to SCP-275's antagonistic behavior.

Subject has requested to be provided with:
* One four poster bed with silk sheets, to be changed daily. (//Denied//)
* One standard bed, with sheets to be changed every two weeks. (//Approved//)
* One high quality widescreen television, with unlimited cable access. (//Denied//)
* One high quality widescreen television, with limited cable access. (//Denied//)
* One high quality widescreen television. (//Denied//)
* One basic television. (//Approved//)
* One DVD player, with several DVDs of the subjects choice. (//Approved//)
* A selection of clothing, imported from France, designed for her personally by top class designers, made of cashmere and silk among other things, all designated by the subject. (//Denied//)
* A selection of basic clothing, as chosen by the subject. (//Approved//)
* Daily baths of fresh goat's milk. (//Denied//)
* A shower, and choice of basic soaps and towels. (//Approved//)
* A collection of gold jewelry, personally selected by the subject, up to twelve thousand (12,000) dollars in net worth. (//Denied//)
* Several highly expensive decorative items, including a Ming vase, Persian rug, and paintings by high profile artists. (//Denied//)
* High class food, such as lobster, cavier, and sirloin steak on a daily basis. (//Denied. Subject is to be served basic rations, as is every subject on site, barring those with extraordinary dietary needs//)
* Over forty (40) liters of various high quality alcohols, including French Champagne. (//Denied//)
* A box of highest quality Cuban cigars every week. (//Denied//)
* A carton of cigarettes every week, brand chosen by the subject. (//Approved//)

**Description:** SCP-275 is a woman of mixed race, with observable characteristics of African, Eastern European, Middle Eastern, and Asian heritage. Hair and eyes are brown, although subject prefers to dye hair a bright shade of red. Subject claims to be one hundred and sixty-eight (168) years of age, despite appearing to be in her late thirties or early forties. Subject is 1.63 m (5 ft 4 in) tall and appears to have a normal weight for her height, but in fact weighs 192.78 kg (425 lbs). She speaks most Middle Eastern dialects fluently, with a faint unidentifiable accent.

SCP-275 has normal human biological needs and functions, and displays average strength for a woman her age and size. However, subject is almost completely resistant to physical trauma, various forms of radiation, and extreme temperatures. Extensive testing has failed to cause damage beyond minor bruising, and SCP-275 cannot recall ever sustaining physical injury.

The majority of SCP-275's mass comprises elements common to all organic life.  However, many of the structural compounds appear to have been replaced with significantly more durable substitutes, as well as elevated amounts of various heavy metals. Foundation researchers have thus far been unable to collect tissue samples, except through a cross experiment involving [[[SCP-073]]].

Attempts to X-ray or scan the subject have met with failure, as subject's skin contains significant quantities of radio-opaque elements.  Diffractometry tests upon the skin sample obtained in Experiment 275-073 indicate the presence of several novel polymers.  While the exact structure of these compounds is still undetermined, analysis suggests that they are or are related in structure and composition to aromatic polyamides (aramids), some combined in helico-auxetic arrangements, which would explain the subject's exceptional thermal resistance.  Side-groups of these polymers seem to be the most common location for the added heavy metals contained in SCP-275's tissues.  It is not currently known how the subject's body produces these compounds, but due to their obvious potential utility in protective wear, O5-██ has indicated that their replication should be a priority in studies of SCP-275.

Subject's hair and nails are not invulnerable, but are far harder and more resilient than those of normal humans. A single strand of hair functions as an extremely sharp cutting wire, and the nails cut easily through cloth and human skin. To reduce danger to personnel, subject's hair is to be kept at a length not exceeding 5cm (2in) and her nails are to be kept as short as possible. Maintenance is to be performed every three months (see below) with an acetylene torch and a high-quality angle grinder, with SCP-275 under full restraints.

Subject ages at a rate approximately one-quarter that of normal human aging; her menstrual cycle is approximately six months long, with menses itself generally lasting for three to four (3 -4) weeks. Hair and nail growth is proportionate.

SCP-275 suffers from severe anger management issues, responding even to minor problems with violence. Subject's personality is highly antagonistic and abrasive, displaying arrogance and irrational hostility in dealings with others. Whether this mental state derives from her unique physiology is unknown; staff psychiatrists speculate that her invulnerability, in making her immune to normal consequences, may have led her to develop a pathological level of entitlement.

Subject claims to have been born in Iraq during the decline of the Ottoman Empire. Shortly after her abilities manifested themselves, major hostilities broke out in that region; SCP-275 rented out her abilities to the highest bidder and found near-continuous employment as a mercenary. The Foundation received several reports of SCP-275 operating in this capacity during the Persian Gulf conflict, even coming into contact with rogue agent [[[Bijhan]]] at one point. Subject was using her invulnerability to weapons fire to her advantage, renting out her abilities to the highest bidder, when she was eventually located and brought into custody.
