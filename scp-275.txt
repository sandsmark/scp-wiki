**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Subject is to be contained within two 6 m x 6 m (20 ft x 20 ft) subterranean cells, that is only accessible by a freestanding overhead elevator, although she is allowed short term access to the communal facilities provided she behaves, and is accompanied by no fewer than four operatives, all armed with gas grenades filled with an incapacitating agent.

Personnel are not to respond to SCP-275's antagonistic behavior.

Subject has requested to be provided with:
* One four poster bed with silk sheets, to be changed daily. (//Denied//)
* One standard bed, with sheets to be changed every two weeks. (//Approved//)
* One high quality widescreen television, with unlimited cable access. (//Denied//)
* One high quality widescreen television, with limited cable access. (//Denied//)
* One high quality widescreen television. (//Denied//)
* One basic television. (//Approved//)
* One DVD player, with several DVDs of the subjects choice.

**Description:** SCP-275 is a tanned woman of unknown race, although rough estimates would place a mixture of at least African, Eastern European, Middle Eastern, and Asian bloodlines in her ancestry, discerned from observation of her physical appearance. Hair and eyes are brown, although subject prefers to dye hair a bright shade of red. Subject claims to be one hundred and sixty-eight (168) years of age, despite appearing to be in her late thirties, early forties. Subject is 1.63 m (5 ft 4 in) tall and weighs 192.78 kg (425 lbs), again despite having an appropriate and healthy sized figure. She speaks most dialects of the Middle East fluently, and speaks with a mild accent.

SCP-275 is perfectly normal in the fact that she needs to breathe, eat, and sleep. However, subject is unique in the fact that she is almost completely resistant to extreme physical trauma, various forms of radiation, and extreme temperatures. There is no known record, either by our //extensive// testing, or by SCP-275's recollection, of the subject's flesh being damaged to anything more than a bruise, and her skin itself has never been pierced.

Testing has deduced that majority of mass that SCP-275 is comprised of is a large amount of carbon, in addition to the regular amount human beings are made of. However, the molecular structure of the carbon within SCP-275 is wildly different than anything that has ever been recorded, being structured in a way that is reminiscent of the molecular composition of diamond, only much larger and much more complex. A blood sample was only capable of being obtained through a cross experiment involving [[[SCP-073]]].

Attempts have been made to X-ray or scan the subject, but results were poor to say the least. Subject's skin alone has a higher density than lead, repelling most attempts penetrate it with radiological or electromagnetic means.

This "impenetrability" of the subject extends through the entirety of the subject, including her hair and nails. The hair of the subject is so resilient that a single strand can be used as an extremely sharp cutting wire, with the capability to slice through steel and even titanium. Subject has claimed that her hair and nails have not been properly cut since she was fourteen (14), just before her ability manifested itself, and that now she can only cut her hair with prolonged exposure to a high source of heat, such as a blowtorch, and that she must regularly wear down her nails with a high quality angle grinder.

In addition to this, due to her physical makeup and density, her biology has been slowed as well. Subject ages at least a fourth of the normal rate of aging; also, her menstrual cycle is approximately six months long, with menses itself generally lasting for three to four (3 -4) weeks.

One of the more worrying things about SCP-275 is her mental state. Whether it is a hormonal imbalance brought about by her unique physiology, psychological problems from childhood, or simply a result of being immune to most punishments others would fear, subject suffers from severe anger management issues, dealing with most major problems with irrationality and violence. Regarding personality, subject is highly antagonistic and abrasive, lashing out at others with little to no provocative action on behalf of the recipients.

She had been noted several times around the Persian Gulf, even coming into contact with rogue agent [[[Bijhan]]] at one point. Apparently, she had been using her invulnerability to weapons fire to her advantage, renting out her abilities to the highest bidder when she had been eventually found and captured by the Foundation.

Subject claims to have been born in Iraq during the decline of the Ottoman Empire, and by the time major hostilities had broken out, her abilities had manifested themselves, allowing her a role outside of the traditional one that was expected of women at that time.
