**Item#:** SCP-275


**Object Class:** Euclid


**Special Containment Procedures:** 

Subject is to be treated similarily to a normal member of staff, although she is to be denied longterm access to the outside world and is restricted to a Level 2 clearance for information. A tracking module is always to be on her presence and if she displays unprovoked violent behaviour towards other members of staff, she is to be incapacitated by on site gas squad, and retained in a solid cement cell, ten (10) by ten (10) foot underground, which is only capable of being accessed by an overhead elevator, until she has reasonably calmed down.


**Description:**

SCP-275 is a woman of unknown race, although rough estimates would place a mixture of at least African-American, Eastern European and Asian bloodlines in her ancestry, discerned from observation of her physical appearance. Hair and eyes are brown, although subject prefers to dye hair a bright shade of red. Subject claims to be sixty eight (68) years of age and has proved it with her driving license and birth certificate, despite appearing to be in her early twenties.

SCP-275 is perfectly normal in the fact that she needs to breath, eat and sleep. However, subject is unique in the fact that she is almost completely resistant to extreme physical trauma and extreme temperatures. There is no know record, either by our //extensive// testing, or by SCP-275s recollection, of the subjects flesh being damaged to anything more than a bruise, and her skin itself has never been pierced.
