//In between each tiny thing,//
//Cracked in rock or dreamed in dreams,//
//Lies a piece of a mystery,//
//Its secrets//

//In each spark of lightning,//
//Drawn on walls, in sewing seams,//
//Lies something we barely see,//
//Its secrets//

//Lean in close, lend an ear,//
//Do not fuss, forget the years,//
//Everything will be explained//
//And all in good time//
//What secrets kept from you//
//Inside your own mind?//

__NOTE FROM THE AUTHOR:__ //This tale series / project is on hold, as I finish up// [[[Vend-a-Friend]]] //and do other IRL things. This thing is unfinished -- wildly so, only barely begun -- but trust me that I do not leave projects to sit and rot. Consider this more like, preserved in a fridge, then festering and moldy. That is all. Sorry to keep those who like this series, if you exist, waiting!//
