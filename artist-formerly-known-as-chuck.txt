> The following digital documents were intercepted by outzone agents from Artist networks in the former United States territory of Bismarck, North Dakota between the dates of July 8th, 2033 and January 13th, 2036. 
> All three documents are believed to be written by Charley De Salvo, also known as "The Artist Formerly Known As Chuck". De Salvo was previously a known member of Artist collective "Are We Cool Yet?" prior to the [http://www.scp-wiki.net/misery-makes-company MA-event], but had no detectable activity between the event and 2033.

[[tab Project Proposal 2034-012: The Champion of the New World]]
**Title:** //The Champion of the New World//

**Material Requirements:** 
* Six white canvas tarps
* 50m flexible stainless steel tubing
* Two glass spheres (30-50cm diameter)
* Nylon cord
* ~6 metric tons concrete
* 12m stainless steel rods
* Latex paint

**Abstract:** //The Champion of the New World// is a 10m-tall statue and monument composed of concrete and steel, and ornamented with painted canvas and glass eyes (See enclosed pencil sketch). The base of this statue will be an 8m-tall concrete monolith, with three pieces of steel tubing attached at the upper edge to act as a neck and arms, with concrete hands (using the steel rods as fingers) and head (with set glass eyes) attached at the other ends. The head and upper "body" of this statue will be covered with the canvas.

The canvas coverings of the statue will be painted by a team of anartists with patterns designed to enhance tactical, intellectual and artistic performance, as well as provide a number of other properties (not shown in sketch). These paintings on the canvas will **not** include any depictions of faces. The monolith will be engraved with the names of known Artists killed or detained by the United Front.

//The Champion of the New World// will be constructed within a properly-enclosed area in front of the capitol building to ensure proper development of its intelligence and personality, and will be revealed and activated at the initiation of the 2034 exhibition. The piece will remain public in the exhibition grounds indefinitely.

**Intent:** The past few years have been very challenging, even for non-figurative Artists. If the destruction/corruption of a large portion of our artwork during A-Day wasn't enough, the resulting rise of the United Front has since torn our community to shreds. Today, we are hunted by the UF for our artistic drive and ability. If it seems like I'm stating the obvious, it's only because I hope that this will one day act as a history lesson after everything has changed.

After the 2024 exhibition was abruptly cancelled, it seems appropriate that the 2034 exhibition should be used to usher in a new age, and //The Champion of the New World// is intended to do just that. This monument will mark the date in which we make full use of this new artistic climate, instead of being held back by it, and rise to a new level of free artistic expression. 

I'll admit, our previous experiments within the new paradigm have not instilled confidence, especially with the recent collapse of the tattoo commune and the loss of Oregon. However, our current understanding of the methods of enclosure has given us a new tool which I strongly believe will revolutionize artwork. By keeping the work properly enclosed during creation and in the period afterward, the artist can control the development of the work's mind, a process which has previously only been possible for the most skilled anartists.

//The Champion of the New World// will be more than just a symbol and a proof of concept. All of our collective effort will focus on turning it into a formidable, immortal guardian of the arts. It will protect our community from the United Front and anyone else who would try to harm us, and carry our artistic vision with it into the future, until the date when we can create without restriction.

[[tab Project Proposal 2035-004: Stone Soldiers]]
**Title:** //Stone Soldiers//

**Material Requirements:** 
* ~100 metric tons concrete

**Abstract:** //Stone Soldiers// will be 250 identical concrete statues in the rough shape of humans (See enclosed pencil sketch).

These statues will be mass-produced using simple pouring-molds and immediately released to the 2034 exhibition grounds by the Bismarck capitol building.

All existing statues will be destroyed as soon as possible after the neutralization of //The Champion of the New World//, and production will be stopped.

**Intent:** I understand that most of you probably wish you'd never hear from me again after the 2034 exhibition, but I will refer to an ancient allegory:

A rich man's servant was tasked with carrying a bag of gold to the market, and the servant decided to take a shortcut, where he was robbed. The servant returned to the rich man, empty-handed, and after explaining his responsibility in the gold's loss, he began to announce his resignation. The rich man stopped him, and said "I'd rather you didn't leave. Your training cost me a full bag of gold."

While the fall of Bismarck has been a major setback, we need to view it as an opportunity to learn, and I have learned more than anyone else. 

I have never been a parent before, and I had never learned the lesson that, although you can control your child's upbringing, you can't decide what they become. Hopefully, you will all someday forgive me for making my child over 30 feet tall with telepathic powers.

I have also learned that, no matter how powerful the statue may be, it cannot create on its own, giving us the advantage. I'm not stupid or crazy enough to suggest that we create another being of equal power, but instead, we can create a large number of smaller statues. Each will only be a few times more powerful than a regular human, but immune to //Champion//'s abilities. After this new army has taken care of //Champion//, we can deal with each of them individually, and we'll be able to get on with our lives, and our art, just as we have before.

[[tab Project Proposal 2044-029: Emperor's Golden Crown]]
**Title:** //Emperor's Golden Crown//

**Material Requirements:** 
* 300kg copper
* 50kg nickel
* 25kg gold

**Abstract:** //Emperor's Golden Crown// will be a gold-plated copper crown (with a layer of nickel to prevent corrosion), approximately 1m in diameter and .75m tall. The outer surface of the crown will be decorated with minimalist relief images representing events in and leading up to the Emperor's life (see pencil sketch of crown surface):

> A: A-Day
> B: The rise of the United Front and the restriction of art
> C: The creation of the Emperor in 2034
> D: The creation of the Emperor's immortal stone army in 2035
> E: The Emperor's current eminence
> F: The Emperor's future as global leader of the New World

The crown will be offered to the Emperor at the opeing ceremony of the 2044 exhibition.

**Intent:** It is important to remember what our lives were like before the rise of the Emperor and its unstoppable guards, living in fear and uncertainty, without any sort of guidance or support. Today, we are free from the constant threat of the United Front, and with our Eternal Muse, we will never lack inspiration for our artwork. In return, all we have to offer is our respect, loyalty and obedience.

As the tenth-anniversary exhibition approaches, it is time for us to show our gratitude to the Emperor in any way that we can. With its unending leadership combined with our creative abilities, it is almost time, as it was intended since the fateful A-Day all those years ago, for artwork to dominate the world.
