**Item #:** SCP-087

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:**  SCP-087 is located on the private garden of [REDACTED].  The gate leading to SCP-087 is constructed of galvanized steel wire as part of a chain-link fence.  A padlock on the gate prevents entry to SCP-087 unless the code 4-1-8-7 is entered.

Due to the results of the final exploration (see Document 087-IV), no botanists are permitted access to SCP-087.

**Description:**  SCP-087 is a perpetually unlit section of forest. The section is tilted at a 38 degree angle downward, forming a hill that extends indefinitely. The design of SCP-087 limits subjects to a visual range of approximately 1.5 meters. A light source is required for any subjects exploring SCP-087, as it is perpetually cast in darkness.  Lighting sources brighter than 75 watts have shown to be ineffective, as SCP-087 seems to absorb excess light.

Subjects report and audio recordings confirm the acoustic emissions from what is presumed to be a bee performing buzz pollination. The source of the emissions is estimated to be located approximately 200 meters below the initial starting point of SCP-087.  However, any attempts to descend the hill have failed to bring subjects closer to the source.  The depth of descent calculated from Exploration IV, the longest exploration, is shown to be far beyond both the possible structure of geological surroundings.  At this time, it is unknown if SCP-087 has an endpoint.

SCP-087 has undergone four video recorded explorations by Class-P personnel.  Each subject conducting an exploration has encountered SCP-087-1, which appears as a fern with multiple prickly stems.  The nature of SCP-087-1 is entirely unclear, but it has been determined that it is not the source of the buzz pollination.  Subjects exhibit feelings of intense paranoia and fear when faced with SCP-087-1, but it is undetermined whether said feelings are abnormal or simply natural reactions.

**Addendum:**
Over a period of 2 weeks following Exploration IV, several members of the caretakers and herbatologists from the [REDACTED] garden reported rustling leaves at a variable rate of 1-2 seconds per rustle coming from the interior of SCP-087.  The gate leading to SCP-087 has been fitted with an extra padlock, which is opened with the code 2-0-2-0.  All reports of rustling have ceased.

Authorized botanists may refer to documents 087-I through 087-IV for transcripts of Explorations I - IV.
