**Item #:** SCP-3919

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3919 is designated an ATEN-class memetic hazard. The full name of SCP-3919-A and access to any document in which this is recorded is restricted to a single member of Level-1 personnel at all times. Under no circumstances should any item, object, location or concept be referred to by terminology relating to the personal details of SCP-3919-A.

Each instance of SCP-3919-B requires an exclusion zone of variable size, with appropriate cover stories prepared for SCP-3919-B in public spaces. Outside of controlled testing circumstances, interaction with SCP-3919-B instances should be conducted remotely, with appropriate mechanisms in place to retrieve personnel from within SCP-3919-B's area of influence in case of accident.

A Foundation initiative to remove references to SCP-3919-A from public records and amnesticise civilians with knowledge of SCP-3919-A operates in the Czech Republic and international academic settings. As of 2009, all known references to SCP-3919-A in public records have been redacted, with original documents archived by the Foundation. Works by SCP-3919-A have been reattributed and ██ amnesticised individuals with previous knowledge of SCP-3919-A remain under surveillance. 

**Description:** SCP-3919 is a memetic-semantic anomalous phenomenon related to Jan ████████ (SCP-3919-A), a Czech modernist architect who lived from 1905 to 1973. While SCP-3919-A exhibited no known anomalous properties while alive, following his death an anomaly manifested in which eponymous objects, or items understood to be 'his' by multiple individuals, were converted into instances of SCP-3919-B. Instances of SCP-3919-B induce visual and auditory hallucinations in humans in their vicinity. The specifics vary between each instance but consistently reflect memorable scenes from SCP-3919-A's life. While these hallucinations are not inherently harmful, they loop continuously and prevent perception of reality at maximal intensity, making it significantly difficult for individuals to remove themselves from the area of effect. 

SCP-3919 was not observed until 1993, when Charles University in Prague renamed a lecture theatre in its architecture faculty the 'Jan ████████ Theatre', converting it into an instance of SCP-3919-B. While this affected a number of persons and led to Foundation intervention, this was initially thought to be an isolated anomalous location. Combined with uncertainty about SCP-3919-B activation conditions, this allowed for the creation of further SCP-3919-B instances between 1993 and 1998 until current containment procedures were implemented.

The semantic component of SCP-3919 relies on common understanding. The most straightforward condition for activation of SCP-3919 and conversion of an object into an SCP-3919-B instance involves officially naming an object after SCP-3919-A and documenting this fact. This property is relatively straightforward to monitor and control. However, a significantly more dangerous activation of SCP-3919 occurs when references are made in informal usage with the understanding that they refer to SCP-3919-A and the acceptance of this between at least two persons (eg. SCP-3919-B-4). This property is not limited to buildings and has been confirmed to apply to other objects, beings and actions. Testing on abstract concepts is forbidden due to the risk of a CK-class reality restructuring scenario.

A general knowledge of SCP-3919-A's identity (full name, nationality, occupation, and 20th-century existence has been found to be sufficient) is required for an individual to activate SCP-3919's anomalous properties. Beyond this, there are no known limits to the application of SCP-3919, if two individuals cooperate with one another, hence the importance of the information security procedures surrounding SCP-3919-A in the public sphere. Works by SCP-3919-A have been reattributed to other Czech architects and the academic literature altered accordingly.

Amnesticisation of SCP-3919-A's personal contacts was previously standard practice but is no longer relevant as of 2014.

**SCP-3919-A:** I //know// you won't know who this man is. That's why I'm applying to travel. 

**OFFICIAL:** I have had many requests like this recently and I cannot approve them. Where do you plan to look for him? You know how far the Legion went in the war? You could be searching all the way to Vladivostok. It is a much bigger place than here, believe me. You cannot travel without a destination.

**SCP-3919-A:** I know people at Moscow University. 

**OFFICIAL:** Do you have a letter of invitation from them?

**SCP-3919-A:** They know me. I will be travelling to Moscow, I can show you a hotel telegram.

**OFFICIAL:** I cannot approve this request. Comrade, I am trying to help you here. You can trust me when I say nobody will know this man in Moscow. You will waste a lot of time and money and find only disappointment at the end. 

**SCP-3919-A:** But what if - 

**OFFICIAL:** You want to know where he is? I can tell you. He is in an unmarked grave in Siberia, in one of a thousand graves, with a thousand other reactionaries -

**SCP-3919-A:** How //dare// you - 

//SCP-3919-A throws the papers down on the table and takes a step towards the official.// 

**OFFICIAL:** //(aside)// Get him out of here!

//Background noise from attendees.//

**GROPIUS:** A moment, please, gentlemen. If you have not met him already, I would like to welcome an old student of mine, visiting us from Prague. Jan has just completed a wonderful project, I think he can show us some photographs later - yes, Max, those you saw yesterday - but I will simply toast the visit of a friend in these troubled times. To Jan!

//The assembled persons raise their glasses and toast.//

**SCP-3919-A:** Thank you all, for the very nice welcome. //(to Gropius, in German)// My English still needs some work. Your invitation was most kind.

**GROPIUS:** //(in German)// The pleasure is mine. I would be willing to extend the invitation permanently, Jan. You know the situation in Europe is not good. Of course it was worse for me in Germany, but you must still be worried. If you do not come here, there is plenty of work going on in our circle in America -

**SCP-3919-A:** //(in German)// Thank you for the offer, Walter, but with Karolína's pregnancy, it is simply impossible for us to travel. Things will work out. I will trust your British and American friends to look after our country. //(laughs)//

**GROPIUS:** //(in German)// Perhaps, Jan. If things get worse, God forbid, do not forget you have friends here.

//**Item:**// Senior Researcher Dr M. Balážová

//**Background:**// Dr Balážová was converted into an instance of SCP-3919-B on 01/12/1999, projecting a hallucinatory field in a 15m radius. This was traced to a flaw in the automated system responsible for cataloguing SCP-3919 documentation, where a text string referring to the Head of SCP-3919 Research (then Dr Balážová) led to the replacement of SCP-3919 with 'Jan ████████' in a number of documents. Dr Balážová continues her Foundation employment while in containment. She is permitted contact with others via video link and receives regular counselling to mitigate the effects of long-term isolation.

//**Event Date:**// 18/12/1967[[footnote]]Determined from StB records, as with SCP-3919-B-4.[[/footnote]]

//**Description:**//A basement room of the Ministry of Industry in Prague, SCP-3919-A's workplace from 1956. SCP-3919-A is sitting at his desk doing paperwork.

//The door opens and a man enters, identified as Professor E. Krejcar, a colleague of SCP-3919-A's from Charles University.//

**SCP-3919-A:** Yes, can I help you?

**KREJCAR:** Hello, Jan. It's been some time. 

**SCP-3919-A:** Who - Evžen, my god, it's you? I didn't recognise you.

**KREJCAR:** Yes, well, the beard - anyway. I was in Vienna last month, and I saw this in a store, and what should be in it? Here, take a look.

//He hands over a photographic book titled 'Functionalism: An Austro-German-Czech Pictorial History'[[footnote]]Copies of this book have since been removed from public circulation by the Foundation.[[/footnote]], and opens it to a page where the Lesnická St house (SCP-3919-B-2) designed by SCP-3919-A is visible.//

**KREJCAR:** Then I remembered, isn't it today? Happy birthday. For you.

//He passes SCP-3919-A the book, who remains silent.//

**KREJCAR:** I'm sorry for interrupting you. I know it must be hard, after what happened - 

**SCP-3919-A:** Ten years, Evžen. You left me here for ten years, without a letter or call, and now you decide to show up?

**KREJCAR:** It was the fifties, you know what it was like, Jan, we all wanted to - 

//SCP-3919-A stands up and smiles.//

**SCP-3919-A:** It's good to see you, my friend.
