**Item #:** SCP-3713

**Object Class:** --Keter-- Neutralized[[footnote]]Pending reclassification. See Addendum-3713-4 for more details.[[/footnote]]

**Special Containment Procedures:** Dr. Robert Dorer is to act as a psychotherapist/counselor for PoI-3713 and is to meet with them at least once every month, utilizing audiovisual communication platforms[[footnote]]Such as Skype or Discord VoIP.[[/footnote]] when necessary. If any anomalous activity is discovered or suspected, Dr. Dorer is to report the development immediately. Otherwise, sessions are allowed to remain private and unrecorded as per the will of the Ethics Committee.

[[collapsible show="► Archived Containment Procedures" hide="◄ Archived Containment Procedures" hideLocation="both"]]
During an SCP-3713 event,  incoming traffic is to be diverted under the guise of military operations. Should an SCP-3713 Event be detected, a team of D-Class personnel equipped with basic audiovisual recording equipment are to be immediately deployed to the location to document the event.

Any records of activity are to be removed from all public knowledge. Witnesses and SCP-3713-A instances are to be amnesticized followed standard procedures. All D-Class are to be recovered immediately and the footage captured is to be extensively reviewed. Any records of activity are to be purged from all public knowledge as well as witnesses amnesticized to reduce suspicions.

**Description:** SCP-3713 was a series of reality degradation events originating at 49.90° N, 97.14° W (Winnipeg, Canada) and ending at 18.24° N, 66.04° W (Caguas, Puerto Rico) between 11/17/1898 and 08/07/2015. These events only affected cities legally recognized by the US government and extended roughly 1 km outside of the cities' legal boundaries. Only a single city would be affected at a time.

When an SCP-3713 event occurred, the population (defined as SCP-3713-A) began to behave as though they were members of a cast in a musical production, with the set and setting equivalent to the real life locality. The plot of each SCP-3713 Event changed between instances but tended to be roughly determined by events already set in motion before the occurrence of said event. For example, a major plot point during event SCP-3713-13 was the cancellation of an annual Christmas parade, which had been already planned for several weeks prior. A random group within the city, ranging from four to six individuals (defined as SCP-3713-A Prime), would be the focus of some sort of plot, often accompanied by a "supporting cast" consisting of an additional five to ten individuals.

Any new objects or people entering the area of effect would slowly become subject to the anomaly's effects and be converted into a prop or actor. For objects this effect was almost instantaneous, while for people this process could take anywhere from 5 minutes to 6 hours, depending on the person's proximity to SCP-3713-A Prime. This effect was stronger the more SCP-3713-A Prime individuals were gathered in one place.  Following the conclusion of the event, roughly 99% of objects and all affected individuals would revert to normal.

SCP-3713 events would follow a vague Prologue, Act I, Intermission, Act II pattern, with a possible second Intermission and Act III. The Prologue was designated as the time in which SCP-3713's effects first show, beginning with the conversion of many objects into props (exact specifications difficult to measure and thus uncertain). Most members of SCP-3713-A would begin to lose intricacies of emotional expression and social interaction. Intermissions would be noted by all members of SCP-3713-A returning to their home (when applicable), and having between zero and eighteen members disappear and reappear at the beginning of the next Act. After all Acts are done, all members of SCP-3713-A would gather at the edge of SCP-3713's area of effect and bow.

As soon as bows were finished, SCP-3713's effects would disappear. Members of SCP-3713-A would return to their homes and resume normal behaviors and routines the next day. Due to an as of yet unidentified antimemetic effect, all SCP-3713-A members would find nothing odd about the SCP-3713 event unless interrogated. SCP-3713-A were considered mundane once more after amnesticization.

||~ Event||~ Location||~ Plot||~ Notes||
||__SCP-3713-7__||Hortonville, Wisconsin 06/19/1937||The first musical piece, identifying the main member of SCP-3713-A Prime, centered around a small boy being raised by his grandparents lamenting on how they abuse him. Shortly afterwards, he found a group of small (less than 8cm tall) humanoids which call themselves the Hows. The boy became emperor of the Hows, and used them to kill his grandparents. A role reversal occurred, wherein the boy became mad with power and attempted to take over as mayor of the city. The event climaxed when the Hows fought back against him and reclaimed their independence.||The Hows have since been contained and classified as SCP-████.||
||__SCP-3713-11__||Gallpolis, Ohio 04/04/1963||SCP-███ breached containment, incapacitating and wounding several researchers. The protagonists (MTF-Lambda-14, "The Extras") attempted to survive and recontain the anomaly. It was revealed that the Site-██ Director had released SCP-███ in an effort of world domination. The MTF unit uncovered more clues about SCP-███ and the Site Director, allowing them to set up a trap for them both. The event climaxed in a musical number (titled "Why Do We Even Try", sung by SCP-███, the Site Director, and all of the agents) after which the MTF unit successfully recontained SCP-███ and detained the Site Director.||Several SCPs were neutralized following the event, as they had been converted into plastic replicas and did not revert back to their anomalous form. SCP-████ was successfully recontained.||
||__SCP-3713-16__||Brickhaven, North Carolina 09/28/1995||Instance began with a musical number involving a bank heist. The police investigated the crime, and eventually one ended up undercover in a drug ring[[footnote]]Supposedly "secret" meetings were kept in relatively easy to observe places, and SCP-3713-A instances showed little concern over others hearing their conversations despite their subject matter.[[/footnote]]. The story soon refocused to include D-590300 (sent in with recording equipment). The citizens began to question D-590300's origins. Once she told them in song (titled "We Stay in the Dark (So You May Live in the Light)"), they began to hail her as their savior and created a cult. _
 _
D-590300 attempted to get people to stop worshiping her, eventually teaming up with the drug ring to hide herself from the public. When the cult worshiping continued despite her absence, the undercover cop confronted the cult and attempted to convince them via song (titled "No One Wants the D"). The plot ended with all cult members burning their robes and returning to normal city life, and the drug ring returning the stolen money due to taking a liking to the undercover cop character.||Containment Procedures remain unchanged; a vote by Level 4/3713 personnel concluded at 19 to 10 in favor of maintaining current procedures. Amnestics successfully administrated.|| 
||__SCP-3713-18__||Caguas, Puerto Rico 07/26/2015||The event began with the announcement of a particularly extravagant school play. SCP-3713-A Prime was comprised of several friends who were going to audition but met many problems in the process. Every member of SCP-3713-A Prime overcame various obstacles preventing them from auditioning, except for two of them (Camila Marquez and Eric Pantillo). It was revealed in a musical number that these two members of SCP-3713-A Prime were in love with each other but didn't know it, and wished not to be in the play because of the presence of one another. _
 _
By collaborating with the secondary cast, both Camila and Eric were led downtown, where a musical number involving a large number of SCP-3713-A was performed by all members of SCP-3713-A Prime except Camila. Eric was ultimately too scared to profess his love and it resulted in failure. However, Camila and Eric decided to participate in the play regardless. Act-III involved the play being put on, where Eric ultimately confessed his love for Camila in the final act of the play.||This was the first and only event where an individual was recorded deviating from the normal behavior. See Addendum-3713-2 for further details.||

**Addendum-3713-2 | Further Details on Event SCP-3713-18**
Despite being a part of SCP-3713-A Prime, Camila Marquez AKA PoI-3713 never sang throughout the entirety of the SCP-3713 event and in several parts deviated significantly from what would have been the presumed story line of SCP-3713. Although initially calm during the events, presumably thinking that her friends were playing a prank or practicing during the first musical events, PoI-3713 expressed fear and confusion in many of the events following these, especially musical events which involved large amounts of people. During the bulk of SCP-3713-18 members of SCP-3713-A ignored her behaviors and continued as if she was acting normally.

PoI-3713 expressed intense confusion at the end of Act-III, where she was surrounded by singing members of SCP-3713-A, and then forced to follow the crowd prior to the ending of Act-III. PoI-3713 broke from the crowd of SCP-3713-A and ran South from Caguas towards Guayama. As PoI-3713 approached the boundary of SCP-3713-18, the area of effect began to expand about 1 kilometer ahead of her.

Upon reaching Guayama, PoI-3713 was met with a crowd of over 1,000 SCP-3713-A instances. All instances were singing a song, the main chorus line being "Someone is Slacking[[footnote]]The full repeated line was "Someone is slacking, someone is drowning, someone is drowning and we're drowning with her".[[/footnote]]". PoI-3713 was picked up by the crowd, but escaped by breaking a window and climbing through it. After reaching the top of the three story building, PoI-3713 held their position for roughly an hour before SCP-3713-A members began to climb onto the roof through the ventilation systems. PoI-3713 was forced to back towards the edge of the building, at which point she turned around and jumped.

Just before hitting the ground, PoI-3713 disappeared. Three hours after the disappearance of PoI-3713, all effects of SCP-3713 ceased. Members of SCP-3713-A in Caguas were dehydrated and malnourished due to standing in one place for roughly 72 hours. 18 lives were lost to various car crashes or bleeding out due to PoI-3713's escape efforts. A mass amnesticization and disinformation campaign was soon underway, and medical attention was given to injured individuals.

PoI-3713 reappeared on the street, unconscious but alive, with several bruises on her head and large gashes of unknown origin on both her forearms. PoI-3713 was immediately taken under intensive care. After two weeks of recovery, PoI-3713 was returned to society and was assigned to a Foundation therapist. PoI-3713 has since shown cinematophobia, theatrophobia, heliophobia, post traumatic stress disorder (which is often triggered in tandem with the previous three fears), and a highly increased interest in photography and cinematography (despite her fear of it). For the sake of PoI-3713's mental health her mother, Cecelia Marquez, has been made somewhat aware of the events that transpired and the consequences of sharing information. No SCP-3713 events have occurred since, as of the time of writing (LAST UPDATED: 08/09/2024).

**Addendum-3713-3 | Recovered Information from PoI-3713 During Intensive Care**
After one week of recovery, PoI-3713 was able to speak. An interview was conducted immediately, and recorded below.

Further interviews yielded no new information, with PoI-3713 continuing their fascination with the door and showing general paranoia. Due to PoI-3713's knowledge of SCP-3713 and their unique mental disorders, the Ethics Committee ruled that PoI-3713 be returned to society without amnestics and see a Foundation therapist made aware of the situation in full. This arrangement has continued to the time of writing (LAST UPDATED: 08/09/2024).

The following text file, named "(OvO)", was recovered from PoI-3713's phone.

**Addendum-3713-4 | Further Anomalous Activities**
On 11/02/2024, PoI-3713 was reported missing by Ms. Marquez. A single Foundation agent was sent to the house to investigate. The transcription below is their interview with Ms. Marquez.

[[collapsible show="► Interview w/ Ms. Marquez" hide="◄ Interview w/ Ms. Marquez" hideLocation="both"]]
> **Interviewer:** Agent Miguel
> **Interviewee:** Ms. Marquez
> **Conducted:** 11/03/2024
> **Notes:** Interview was conducted in the living room with Ms. Marquez on the couch and Agent Miguel sitting opposite them on a chair. A coffee table separates them, where the audio recorder was placed. Interview was conducted in Spanish and translated to English for ease of reading.
> 
> <BEGIN LOG>
> 
> **Agent Miguel:** Alright, I want you to tell me if Camila ever seemed to want to run away, or if you know of anything that would push her to.
> 
> **Ms. Marquez:** (//Pause.//) No, no I don't think so. She was very open with me, even if she didn't know how to explain something. When she was upset she would tell me... which was regrettably often. She didn't want to run away from home. She couldn't have wanted to.
> 
> **Agent Miguel:** You can think of no influence that would have driven her away?
> 
> **Ms. Marquez:** I thought she was getting more stable...
> 
> (//Pause.//)
> 
> **Agent Miguel:** Has she ever run away before?
> 
> **Ms. Marquez:** Yes, when she was very little. (//Pause.//)
> 
> **Agent Miguel:** What made her do that?
> 
> **Ms. Marquez:** (//Sniffles.//) She was in a school play, in 3rd Grade. (//Pause.//) She was doing so well, but it came to her solo -- she's an amazing singer, even if she doesn't do it too often, voice of an angel -- and... and she just sat there. Everyone was looking at her. She just froze.
> 
> (//Ms. Marquez blows her nose.//)
> 
> **Ms. Marquez:** It was more than stage fright, I know it, you can feel these things when you're a mother. She just sat there and stared out at the audience. She didn't move. She didn't talk. She just stood there. The teacher cued her, and she looked down at the teacher. I couldn't help it, I spoke up and called to my daughter, I said... I said "honey" and she ran. She ran out the door and just kept running.
> 
> (//Ms. Marquez blows her nose again.//)
> 
> **Ms. Marquez:** We chased her but nobody got her before she was out in the woods, and... and we couldn't find her. My husband called the police and got them to look for her in the forest, and they found her cut and bruised and... there were red marks around her throat. She looked pale. They told us it had to have been self harm, but she wouldn't have done that. We just took her home and she slept for three days.
> 
> **Agent Miguel:** Did she tell you what happened?
> 
> **Ms. Marquez:** She was more comfortable with her dad at the time, and so he heard it. He said that she would feel comfortable to talk to me in time and that it would be better if she went at her own pace. I wanted to know, but I understood. Before it came time to...
> 
> (//Ms. Marquez sniffles.//)
> 
> **Ms. Marquez:** He passed. Joaquin Marquez. He was big and strong, like you. Hard worker. He had lung cancer. Smoked. (//Pause.//) I don't know if Camila ever told me why that happened. It never felt right to ask. She became a new person when Joaquin passed. Made her own breakfast, did her homework on time. Walked to the bus. Didn't talk as much.
> 
> **Agent Miguel:** Did she ever --
> 
> **Ms. Marquez:** She had dreams ever since. She sometimes hesitated at the door, and I asked her why she didn't want to go outside, and she told me... she told me she didn't want to be watched. The only place she felt privacy was in the home anymore. Recently she only did shopping at night, she said that in the day the sun felt like it was focusing on her. When she was a toddler she would wake up screaming, I would calm her down and she would ask me if I was "playing pretend". She thought we weren't her parents, sometimes. Sometimes she didn't think anyone was anyone.
> 
> (//Pause.//)
> 
> **Agent Miguel:** And there is nothing you know that might be the cause for her leaving?
> 
> **Ms. Marquez:** No. She wouldn't run away.
> 
> **Agent Miguel:** Any closing statements?
> 
> (//Pause.//)
> 
> **Agent Miguel:** We will find your daughter. She's coming back.
> 
> **Ms. Marquez:** I know. I know.
> 
> (//Pause.//)
> 
> **Ms. Marquez:** There is something you should see.
> 
> (//Ms. Marquez is heard getting up and walking upstairs. After thirty seconds, she is heard descending the stairs and sitting back down. Plastic crinkling suggests the exchange of an item.//)
> 
> **Ms. Marquez:** This was in her toilet. I didn't show the police, because you're more important. You know what is wrong with her, even if I don't. Please. Tell me this means something to you.
> 
> (//Pause. Several plastic crinkles are heard.//)
> 
> **Agent Miguel:** This means something to us. Thank you.
> 
> **Ms. Marquez:** Find her, Miguel. Find her.
> 
> <END LOG>

Ms. Marquez had passed Agent Miguel a plastic bag containing vomit, blood (both matching PoI-3713's DNA), and eight flyers damaged by various fluids. All things printed in small text were illegible, but the most legible flyer read:

> //[...]// Returns! The new hit Bl//[...]//ram Show, touring now! Touring //now//! Coming back //[...]//ever! Come watch, //we will//! Get into your positions,
