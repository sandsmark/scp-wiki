Yo! So as well as writing, I like to draw! Here are some of shit quality drawings. And by that I mean most of them have shit lighting. And most of them aren’t finished. Eh. I’m not amazing at pasting images into articles, so I just posted them on one of my many unused tumblrs. 

I do hope that is alright. If anyone could help with image posting, it would be appreciated! --I’m good at this I promise--

Most of them are of personnel, tho I do have SCPs there! Like 4640, 4205, 3001, 2999 A and B, 590, and this giant post with a bunch of them that was a contest entry for Amino, yes, Amino haha. But, I won, haha. Anyway.
