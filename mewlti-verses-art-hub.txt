This was an experiment with a kinda au thing where Gerald got around 2295, that’s why there are so many patches on him haha. And I drew him with a cane, because the dude’s been injured over 64 times.

I made this when talking to my friend about posting one of my SCPs convinced it would fail, and to be fair, it didn’t do amazing. It’s still on the main site tho, and I’m working to improve it. I spent months on it, apparently two months wasn’t enough, haha.
