**Excursion 310-DJ4-9LK**
**Priming:** [[[SCP-765]]] (success)
**Trigger:** Standard lethal injection
**Equipment:** Standard
**Reality Description:** SCP-1985 initially arrived in the core of an active volcano and expired. Excursion was repeated.
Individuals associated with The Serpent's Hand had triggered an AK-class end of the world scenario utilizing SCP-765 in combination with an unknown effect-amplifier, after the alternate reality's Foundation had decided to expand its size by 1000% for unknown reasons. 90% of the world's population was afflicted with crippling lethargy, apathy, boredom, and depression, causing vast numbers to die of starvation, and sometimes dehydration, as they ceased to eat or drink respectively. SCP-1985 was unfortunately not immune to this effect, and died of starvation after several months.
**Logs:** [FORTHCOMING]
**Retrieval:** Uneventful. SCP-1985 expressed intense relief at being free of SCP-765's effect.
**Retrieved Items:** A canister of water from the modified SCP-765, collected before SCP-1985 succumbed to the effect.
**Notes:** This was intended to test to see if SCP-1985 would find a reality undergoing a K-Class scenario related to the safest of Safe-class SCPs. 

**Excursion 17V-MNU-094**
**Priming:** [[[SCP-573]]] (success)
**Trigger:** Standard lethal injection
**Equipment:** Standard
**Reality Description:** SCP-573 was stolen from the Foundation by members of the Chaos Insurgency, who used it to control several million animals and children in the continental United States, first using them to extract political concessions, then using them as a makeshift army, then eventually slaughtering most of them. No alteration to SCP-573 was apparently required to achieve this effect.
Notably, during this excursion, SCP-1985 encountered what appeared to be an alternate version of itself, also in excursion form with similar visual traits, and completely missing both arms. This alternate version of SCP-1985 fled on sight, and SCP-1985 was unable to relocate it. SCP-1985 was killed by the Chaos Insurgency after two weeks.
**Logs:** [FORTHCOMING]
**Retrieval:** Uneventful
**Retrieved Items:** None.
**Notes:** It is not known if this reality's version of SCP-573 possesses the same capabilities that its alternate demonstrated during this excursion.

**Excursion 051-UWJ-97Y**
**Priming:** [[[SCP-1157]]] (success)
**Trigger:** Standard lethal injection
**Equipment:** Standard
**Reality Description:** SK-class dominance shift scenario in which instances of SCP-1157 had become the dominant species of Earth. Baseline humans made up a significant minority, with the majority of their population having been killed. Instances of SCP-1157 controlled most major countries, though humans still controlled a minority. The Foundation was still present and containing the majority of extant SCP items, and many SCP-1157 instances were working with the Foundation and the remnants of the Global Occult Coalition to attempt to reverse the SK-class scenario. Additionally, not all SCP-1157 instances were identical to SCP-1157-1; sixteen different base forms were observed, each represented by a different collective consciousness. [DATA EXPUNGED]
**Logs:** [FORTHCOMING]
**Retrieval:** Uneventful.
**Retrieved Items:** [DATA EXPUNGED]
**Notes:** Remainder of excursion details, including nature of retrieved items, are currently classified Level 5.

**Excursion 1FR-L75-03X**
**Priming:** [[[SCP-1004]]]
**Trigger:** Standard lethal injection
**Equipment:** Standard
**Reality Description:** Mass broadcast and distribution of SCP-1004 by associates of The Factory resulted in an AK-class end of the world scenario in which 94% of the global population exhibited behavior characteristic of SCP-1004's final stages. The Foundation survived in this reality, and efforts to reverse SCP-1004's effects were ongoing, though resulting in only minor success. SCP-1985 was killed within one week of arrival.
**Logs:** [RESTRICTED]
**Retrieval:** Uneventful
**Retrieved Items:** None.
**Notes:** Request was made by Dr. Bright, to investigate the possible seriousness of SCP-1004's effects. 

**Excursion NIN-100-RC3**
**Priming:** None
**Trigger:** SCP-1985 was caught in crossfire during a Chaos Insurgency incursion during a move between sites, sustaining injuries to its left leg. SCP-1985 acquired a weapon and fatally shot itself.
**Equipment:** None except for inbuilt recording equipment
**Reality Description:** [EXPUNGED DATA PENDING RELEASE] SCP-1985 was publicly tortured and killed in a group execution. Members of group included four local versions of SCP-1985's family members.
**Logs:** [RESTRICTED]
**Retrieval:** Uneventful. 
**Retrieved Items:** [EXPUNGED DATA PENDING RELEASE]
**Notes:** As typical after an excursion of this nature, SCP-1985 requested temporary isolation and temporary cessation of experimentation. Request granted.

**Excursion V08-FXB-N25**
**Priming:** SCP-1985's own, personal origins (failure)
**Trigger:** Standard lethal injection
**Equipment:** Standard
**Reality Description:** SCP-1985 initially arrived mid-Pacific Ocean and swam to shore. A full-scale [[[SCP-1801]]] outbreak had converted the majority of life on the planet into a single, contiguous, fleshy mass. When SCP-1985 arrived, SCP-1801 had apparently adapted in order to begin converting inorganic material as well, and was in the process of doing so. A small number of SCP Foundation personnel survived, and were attempting to contain the SCP-1801 outbreak, with little success. The SCP-1801 mass attempted to convert SCP-1985 after it accidentally came into close contact with the mass, and SCP-1985 was automatically returned as normal.
**Logs:** [FORTHCOMING]
**Retrieval:** Uneventful
**Retrieved Items:** None.
**Notes:** Accidental discovery of potential extra capabilities associated with SCP-1801 has been passed on as per standard procedure.

**Excursion D4L-41N-K0M**
**Priming:** Repeated exposure to [[[SCP-3932]]] (success)
**Trigger:** Standard lethal injection
**Equipment:** Standard
**Reality Description:** Following Foundation diplomatic intervention, tensions between SCP-3932-Δ nation-states became lessened. This resulted in a temporary peace accord between the nations, who then declared war on humanity. Conversion of all oceanic cetaceans into SCP-3932-Δ instances followed shortly thereafter, with full conversion occurring three months after.
The SCP-3932-Δ instances then caused a partial SK-Class Dominance Shift Scenario, resulting in all oceans being taken over by SCP-3932-Δ instances. The original three nation-states of SCP-3932-Δ emerged as major superpowers, but were unable to retain complete control over the world.
**Logs:** [FORTHCOMING]
**Retrieval:** SCP-1985 manifested in the water off the coast of Australia, having previously been aboard an Great Barrier Reef Empire-In-Exile prison vessel. Rescue dispatched from Site-72.
**Retrieved Items:** None.
**Notes:** In this reality, the Foundation has avoided any attempt to diminish the cold war between SCP-3932-Δ nation-states, out of fear of potential alliance.
