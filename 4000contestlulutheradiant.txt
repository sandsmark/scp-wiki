**Item #:** SCP-4000

**Object Class:** Thaumiel

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to the circumstances of its location and operation, SCP-4000 is to remain integrated into Site-25 and, as such, requires no extra security than would already be appropriate for a Foundation site. However, knowledge of the existence of SCP-4000 itself is restricted to Level 4/4000 clearance or higher, with the exception of any Foundation personnel cleared for work on the Ouroboros Protocol. Regular maintenance of all associated systems of SCP-4000 is to take place weekly, with an allowed delay of no more than 48 hours. If any malfunctions of any components of SCP-4000 or its subsystems are suspected or identified, especially of those systems that are crucial to its continued function, testing is to be immediately halted until repairs have been made.

Regular testing with SCP-4000 is to occur once every 2 weeks. Any subject for testing is allowed, but testing involving classified material, material known to be associated with temporal/ontokinetic anomalies, or material that is known to be memetic, cognitohazardous, or infohazardous in nature is only to be carried out by personnel possessing Level 4/4000 clearance.  --This responsibility is currently assigned to Senior Researcher Mortimer Ericson.-- ##blue| __UPDATE (3/8/1999):__ Screening for candidates must, in addition to standard physical and mental aptitude measurements, must display no less than complete loyalty to the Foundation and its directives to mitigate the risk of an information breach resulting from the use of SCP-4000.##

For testing purposes, a series of digital data repositories, with individual storage capacities no fewer than 10 TB, are to remain at Site 25 at all times within SCP-4000. Due to the nature of SCP-4000, the only precautions necessary to access these repositories will be standard login credentials. These repositories are to contain as much historical text and documentation as feasible, with additions made as necessary when new information is gained through the use of SCP-4000. 

##blue|__UPDATE (3/8/1999):__ Due to further discoveries about SCP-4000's anomalous properties, no one individual may operate SCP-4000 more than 10 times without an interim period of at least 1 month. Any anomalous phenomena or manifestations occurring near individuals who have operated SCP-4000 are to be reported immediately, followed by the immediate barring of that individual from operating SCP-4000 for the foreseeable future.## See Addendum 2.

**Description:** SCP-4000 is a large mechanical device originally created by the Foundation in 1987 as part of Project Hindsight. Though it was once separate from Site-25, it has seen been assimilated into the site's workings to allow for ease of its continued operation. As such, Site-25 is considered part of SCP-4000. The object consists of a dedicated power station (with a total output of 3 MW), a computer array complete with access to Foundation Intranet, a large amalgamation of different mechanisms responsible for SCP-4000's anomalous functions (some of which include standard supercomputer-level hardware and assorted clockwork mechanisms of varying complexity), and a large (about 500 m^^2^^) flat paved area in the center of SCP-4000 that serves as the control room, in the middle of which stands the control panel used for operating SCP-4000.

SCP-4000 (and Site-25 post-integration) demonstrates a poorly-understood form of causal immunity; while time itself passes normally within SCP-4000, it is utterly unaffected by any temporal anomalies that may affect its existence, creation, or operation. Mundane efforts in the present day to further test this property universally fail as well; --evidence of probability manipulation is currently being investigated-- (See Addendum 2). This effect extends to those within SCP-4000; as long as an individual remains within the facility, they share this immunity.

SCP-4000's principal effect is achieved whenever input is received through the control panel. The interface allows for the input of text strings of any size; complexity does not seem to skew the results to any significant degree, as due to the specifics of the [[[SCP-2719|conceptual experimentation and engineering]]] included as part of Project Hindsight, the input is understood through the intention of the operator. The only requirement is that the input must refer to an entity or object.

When input is given and SCP-4000 is activated, the main control room becomes inaccessible for a period of time up to and including, but not exceeding, five minutes. During this active period, the room undergoes extreme temporal distortion around the individual who activated SCP-4000 (hereafter referred to as the operator). The interior becomes a facsimile of the birthplace/place of origin of whatever the input was at the time when the input item came into being. The operator then experiences the entire existence of the input item in real time as illustrated to them by SCP-4000-1. 

SCP-4000-1 is a humanoid entity who varies in apparent age, gender, and race with every manifestation, but a description of the entity wearing a light brown, three-piece suit is consistent across every manifestation. When SCP-4000 is activated and the operator is displaced, SCP-4000-1 introduces itself and begins delivering the history of the input item. SCP-4000-1 describes itself as being an orator or teacher of sorts, with its descriptions and depictions being meticulously thorough, covering every major event and summarizing the minor events relating to the existence of the input item. SCP-4000-1 is universally described by operators as amicable, polite, and enthusiastic, frequently encouraging questions about the input item.

Despite the ability to move about freely in any manifested environment or location, direct interaction with anything in said environment is impossible, as physical contact cannot be achieved. However, items will manifest on the operator as necessary for their continued survival if a certain environment is normally inhospitable (such as SCUBA gear for oceanic environs, standard astronaut suits for space, etc.). During the active period, the operator witnesses the entire life or existence of the input item, starting with its birth/creation and ending with either its death/destruction or, where applicable, its continued existence in the present. 

Once the duration is over, SCP-4000-1 will say goodbye to the operator and thank them for their curiosity. The control room will then return to normal and the operator may exit. Any information gathered through the use of SCP-4000 will be retained with eidetic clarity, with memories showing extreme resistance to fading or erasure by amnestics. Further, any input item that has a memetic, cognitohazardous, or infohazardous property has that property bypassed in the operator's memory with no ill effects [[[SCP-055|barring a few]]] [[[SCP-3125|notable exceptions]]].

**Addendum 1:** Creation and Classification

Project Hindsight was an attempt to create a device that would allow for a complete and thorough documentation of the history of humanity with the intention of preserving it from tampering by uncontained anomalies or the breach of contained anomalies. SCP-4000 is the sum total of Project Hindsight, acting as a crucial part of the Ouroboros Protocol. Multiple esoteric fields of study were exercised and even expanded during Project Hindsight and the creation of SCP-4000, including advanced metallurgy, engineering, and circuitry, applied thaumatology, and temporal manipulation and stabilization.

Classification of SCP-4000 as an anomalous object resulted from preliminary testing revealing the existence of SCP-4000-1. Once a larger base of knowledge regarding the device's function was accumulated and its potential for use was underscored by this knowledge, it was shortly classed as Thaumiel. In light of SCP-4000-1's apparent willingness to cooperate with Foundation efforts to more effectively chronicle history, Project Hindsight is considered a success.

[[collapsible show="PLEASE SUBMIT 5/4000 CREDENTIALS TO VIEW FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE OUROBOROS PROTOCOL" hide="ACCESS GRANTED"]]

The Ouroboros Protocol is an operation planned to take effect soon in the future, preparations for which are an ongoing undertaking occurring throughout all echelons of the Foundation. Once activated, it is an effort to continuously assure the Foundation's continued existence and operation through bootstrapping, retrocausal activity, and ontological insulation. Project Hindsight was one of the first few phases of the Protocol, setting the groundwork for the more labor and resource-intensive stages. For further information about the Ouroboros Protocol, please see Document ███████.

--Following the completion of SCP-4000 and its classification, preparations to enact the Ouroboros Protocol are being made nominally.-- Following the events of Incident 4000-1, preparations to enact the Ouroboros Protocol are halted indefinitely. See Addendum 2.

**Addendum 2:** Incident 4000-1

On 03/8/1999, after routine testing of SCP-4000, Senior Researcher Ericson entered his office to log the results and didn't exit for three hours. Security personnel were alerted to this and sent to his room. Upon their arrival, they observed Ericson sitting at his desk staring at his sidearm, tears in his eyes. As he was taken to the medical wing for processing, personnel further observed that his personal audio log was still open and logged into on his computer. After perusing its contents, personnel notified the Director of Site-25 of heretofore undocumented anomalous properties of SCP-4000. Following this discovery, the containment procedures were shortly revised. An abridged version of the contents of the log are transcribed below:

[[collapsible show="+ Open" hide="- Close"]]

> [BEGIN LOG]
>  
> //5/24/1987//
> This is Researcher Ericson speaking, marking the first activation of the object now designated SCP-4000. I must say, I'm very excited about the opportunities that this machine will provide. Already, the thing works exactly as intended; I told it I wanted to hear about the D-Class in the cell two rooms over, and it took me to some hospital.
> 
> One thing I //didn't// anticipate was the presence of... some person. Well, I mean, of //course// there were people there, but this one clearly didn't belong there. His suit made him stick out like a sore thumb. Of course, though the others didn't notice me, he did. Even said hello. Explained that he was my 'teacher' for the day.
> 
> I was worried, but he quickly added that he was here to tell me all about Carl[[footnote]]The name of the D-Class personnel used during this test.[[/footnote]]. I humored him, and he took me through his whole life. Everything seemed so... so //real//. His birth, his childhood, his... murders, his incarceration. Right up to his transfer to Site-25 and being put in that cell. Then he just thanked me and left.
> 
> I'd like to say I can't wait until I forget what I saw - I don't think I've ever seen someone so vicious with a baseball bat - but that's just it. I can't. The images just... stick in my mind. Whenever I think about them, every sense is just flooded by the memory as if I were witnessing it again. The official transcripts of the construction of the thing say that the core functions of the machine are based off of 'the pioneered scientific field of conceptual entanglement and anchoring', whatever that means. I'd guess that's what I'm experiencing. I didn't just see the past; the past is... //in// my head or something.
> 
> This machine is incredible, but... I'd be lying if I said I wasn't worried.

> //6/8/1987//
> Just another efficacy test. This time, we went for a popular historical figure. I suggested George Washington, and that seemed to go over well. I must say, I'm no history buff or anything like that, but seeing all those battles with my own eyes was something else.
> 
> That guy seemed to enjoy telling it to me, too. Kept wanting me to ask questions, as if he wanted me to drink in every detail. Reminded me of a friend of mine who always had some piece of artwork to show me. This guy wanted to see nothing short of awe from me.
> 
> Well, I'd say he got it... but he also got some concern. I'm not sure what, but something still isn't sitting right with me. Hmm... I don't know. I'm probably just saying that because of the date.
> 
> ...Today would have been Annabelle's 30th birthday.
> 
> ...
> 
> ...Happy birthday, Annabelle. Not a day goes by when I don't think about you.

> Another day, another musty old history book to cross-reference. I swear, if I'd known just how many years of ancient, antiquated drivel I'd have to sit through in the name of progress, I probably would have requested to be transferred to a different project.
> 
> Still, Senior Researcher does have a nice ring to it, now that I'm saying for the first time //since// my promotion, so maybe it's worth it.
> 
> Of course, SCP-4000-1 was enthusiastic as ever. She - well, she was a 'she' this time - but she looked overjoyed to see me again. Made the life of some Christian monk from the 16th century seem downright lively. Every time I come back to that machine, I remember just how much I enjoy -1's 'seminars', if it really is a teacher.
> 
> I must say, though, I'm not looking forward to the next session, even with its enthusiasm.
> 
> ...Another sad Valentine's Day. Hoo-ray.

> //2/15/1988//
> Okay, something's wrong.
> 
> There must be something more to that machine. The information it gave me is as strong as it ever was, so the long-term projections are happening just as predicted, but... there's something else. Something that has me worried.
> 
> I never asked it about myself.
> 
> Last night, I had a strange dream. Rather murky, couldn't make out many details, but I definitely remember my mother being there. Just an overwhelming feeling of contentment washing through me, and then my alarm blaring me awake. When I reached over to turn it off, I noticed something on my nightstand that //certainly// wasn't there before: a bottle. A //baby// bottle. Freshly full to the brim.
> 
> As soon as I saw it, I knew I didn't even have to taste it to know where that milk came from.
> 
> I checked my doors, windows, everything, but nothing had gotten in that I could see. I checked the cameras I'd installed - nothing. I'm... I can never be too sure nowadays after that... that //[[[SCP-631|thing]]]// took my Annabelle.
> 
> Speaking of... Happy Valentine's Day, Annabelle. Even though I'm scared, I'm glad //you// don't have to deal with this.

In light of this new information, additions to the Description of SCP-4000 are currently pending following review by the Director of Site-25. Though Senior Researcher Ericson has received a serious reprimand for concealing this information, he has been scheduled for regular visits to an appointed psychologist and is expected to make a full recovery.

Further investigation into the nature of SCP-4000-1 and the specific property or properties of SCP-4000 that allow for its manifestation is ongoing.
