**Name:** Dr. Sophia N. Light

**Security Clearance Level:** █

**Occupation:** Biological Researcher

**History:** Sophia Light came to the Foundation after a career in biosecurity and classifying infectious diseases for the US government. She created an incident which resulted in the deaths of several military personnel, after which the Foundation offered her a job in data entry. She has somehow bargained her way into becoming a lab assistant, eventually being transferred out of lab work and into administration.

While she is primarily based at Site 41, which she described as "way too goddamn cold for me or anyone", she has made consults at Site 17, Bio-Containment Areas █ and ██, and [DATA EXPUNGED]. Reports of her involvement in --the birth of Christ and-- the apocalypse are false, probably.

In addition to her position as biological researcher, Doctor Light has also preformed the positions of naturalist, field agent, field medic, breakroom medic, surgeon, naturopathic physician, psychologist, accomplice, and distraction.

**Favorite Science Poetry:** [http://wonderingminstrels.blogspot.com/2005/09/old-astronomer-sarah-williams.html The Old Astronomer To His Pupil] by Sarah Williams, [http://annemalu.wordpress.com/2013/11/ The Antiworlds] by Andrei Voznesensky, and [http://www.hpmor.com HPMOR] by Eliezer Yudkowsky.

[[tab Other Projects]]
The [[[Log of Anomalous Items]]]

Ran the [http://www.scp-wiki.net/short-works-contest Short Works contest]. Entries were required to be 500 words or under. The winning entry was LurkD's [[[SCP-2521]]].

[[[SCP-775]]] is actually Gears', but was deleted, then found and replaced on the site, all by, uh, me (during the first great List Purge before hitting 1000.) That's why Sophia Light appears as the page author. Sorry about that, Gears.

[[tab Stories]]
"I don't write //fiction.// I only write real things. I don't even know who wrote these." -Dr. Light

+ SHORT STORIES

[[[Astronomical]]] - A science fiction story in which a dying planet gets a sign from the stars.
[[[The Medium]]] - A murderous sound, a sentient shade of yellow, and a synesthetic agent walk into a containment chamber...
[[[Winding Down]]] - When the world ends, it does so in a quiet and orderly fashion.
[[[Joy to the World]]] - "Oh god, //did// I write this? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry." -Dr. Light
[[[The Flytrap]]] - What is SCP-001? Who are the O5 council? And why doesn't anyone know?
[[[C-Sharp]]] - The technology only allows the signal can only travel back in time five seconds. That's all. Naturally, the Foundation still found a way to make use of it.
[[[It Would Make Sense If That Were True]]] - A view from an alternate universe where the goal of Foundation researchers is… slightly different.

+ PARTS OF A LARGER WHOLE

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/11-mr-feather Mr Feather] - From the [[[Tales of Mr. Collector]]]

+ Work from the [http://www.scp-wiki.net/competitive-eschatology-hub Competitive Eschatology] Canon

Stories mostly orbiting around the adventures of Sophia Light, action administrator, and her attempts to save the world.
[[[Stormfront]]] - The imminent end of the world is not what she hoped to wake up to on a Tuesday morning.
[http://www.scp-wiki.net/the-black-horse The Black Horse: The Crawling Sea] and its [http://www.scp-wiki.net/last-words-from-svalbard Interlude]. One of the Horseman of the Apocalypse breaks containment. Shit gets real. A certain group is interested in getting Light's attention.

+ Work from the [[[Resurrection]]] Canon

[[[Deals With The Devil]]] - One senior staff member hopefully //isn't// making the biggest mistake of her career. MTF Alpha-9 "Last Hope" gets its new commander.
[[[In Harm's Way]]] - The first few days after Alpha-9 is approved by the O5 Council are not exactly a walk in the park.

+ MISCELLANEA

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/lucky-dinosaur The Lucky Dinosaur] - Winner of the 2015 [[[Reimagining Contest]]]. 682 is a giant dinosaur who loves everyone, and delivers a sappy poetic monologue. I'm absolutely serious.

[[tab Scrap Bin]]

The Unfilled Niche - An ecosystem that has prey, predators, and parasites all in order for a species that just isn't there.

The Wonderland Mirrors/Accompanying Log - This is a cool idea I had a long time ago, that might just not work with the site anymore. Aw, maybe I can still pull it off.

Living sound - I'll be honest, I mostly wanted to write this since the original SCP from [[[The Medium]]] was deleted. Maybe I'll come up with something else?

The elephant in the room (-j) - A perfectly normal room. Just toss a few bales of grass in there, and shovel it out once a day. Don't worry about any noises you hear. It's a normal room.

The Gardens: Small patches of gardens that spring up around strange electrical equipment. No known ill or harmful effects, no foreign plants, just unusual cases of order. They tend to grow to a certain size and then stop.

The Iron Ghost: A formerly use iron mine haunted by a ghost. It's usually benevolent but stops being such when people try to take iron from the mine. Appeared while the mine was still in use. (Iron mined has weird properties?)

Orange Diamond Jewelery: A process invented by a company, LoveForever, to turn human ashes into diamond. Bad news: the resulting diamonds are haunted by the souls of the dead used. WHOOPS.
