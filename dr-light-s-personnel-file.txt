title:Dr Light's Personnel File
**Name:** Dr. Sophia N. Light

**Security Clearance Level:** 3

**Occupation:** Biological Researcher

**History:** Sophia Light came to the foundation after a career negating biohazards with the US military. She created an incident which resulted in the deaths of several military personnel, after which the Foundation offered her a job in data entry. She has somehow bargained her way into becoming a lab assistant, putting her skills in biology to use for the Foundation.

While she is primarily based at Site 19, she has made consults at Site 17, Bio-Containment Areas █ and ██, and [DATA EXPUNGED].

In addition to her position as biological researcher, Doctor Light has also preformed the positions of naturalist, field agent, field medic, breakroom medic, surgeon, vetrinarian, psychologist, accomplice, and distraction.

Doctor Light should not be allowed near guns, large amounts of alcohol, or --flutes-- --and accordions-- --ukeleles-- musical insturments of any sort.

**Addendum:** As of recent, several samples of weaponized [DATA EXPUNGED] and other microorganisms have gone missing from the labs. We believe them to be the possesion of Doctor Light. Based on her personal history and the number of sites she's been to, we reccomend further inquiry.
