**Name:** Dr. Sophia N. Light

**Security Clearance Level:** █

**Occupation:** Biological Researcher

**History:** Sophia Light came to the Foundation after a career negating biohazards with the US military. She created an incident which resulted in the deaths of several military personnel, after which the Foundation offered her a job in data entry. She has somehow bargained her way into becoming a lab assistant, putting her skills in biology to use for the Foundation.

While she is primarily based at Site 19, she has made consults at Site 17, Bio-Containment Areas █ and ██, and [DATA EXPUNGED], which she described as "way too goddamn cold for me."

In addition to her position as biological researcher, Doctor Light has also preformed the positions of naturalist, field agent, field medic, breakroom medic, surgeon, naturopathic physician, psychologist, accomplice, and distraction.

**Favorite Science Poetry:** [http://wonderingminstrels.blogspot.com/2005/09/old-astronomer-sarah-williams.html The Old Astronomer To His Pupil] by Sarah Williams, and [http://famouspoetsandpoems.com/poets/andrei_voznesensky/poems/22224 The Antiworlds] by Andrei Voznesensky.

The [[[Log of Anomalous Items]]]

[[[SCP-775]]] is actually Gears', but was deleted, then found and replaced on the site, all by, uh, me (during the first great List Purge before hitting 1000.) That's why Sophia Light appears as the page author. Sorry about that, Gears.

Just ask Light if you want to use one of these.

The Wonderland Mirrors/Accompanying Log - This is a cool idea I had a long time ago, that might just not work with the site anymore. Aw, maybe I can still pull it off.

Haunted dentist's office - Did someone say "body horror"? Because I think someone just said "Body Horror."

Living sound - I'll be honest, I mostly wanted to write this since the original SCP from "The Medium" was deleted. Maybe I'll come up with something else?

The elephant in the room (-j) - A perfectly normal room. Just toss a few bales of grass in there, and shovel it out once a day. Don't worry about any noises you hear. It's a normal room.

The Gardens: Small patches of gardens that spring up around strange electrical equipment. No known ill or harmful effects, no foreign plants, just unusual cases of order. They tend to grow to a certain size and then stop.

The Iron Ghost: A formerly use iron mine haunted by a ghost. It's usually benevolent but stops being such when people try to take iron from the mine. Appeared while the mine was still in use. (Iron mined has weird properties?)

Orange Diamond Jewelery: A process invented by a company, LoveForever, to turn human ashes into diamond. Bad news: the resulting diamonds are haunted by the souls of the dead used. WHOOPS.
