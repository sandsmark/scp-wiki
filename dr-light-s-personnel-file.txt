**Name:** Dr. Sophia N. Light

**Security Clearance Level:** █

**Occupation:** Biological Researcher

**History:** Sophia Light came to the Foundation after a career negating biohazards with the US military. She created an incident which resulted in the deaths of several military personnel, after which the Foundation offered her a job in data entry. She has somehow bargained her way into becoming a lab assistant, putting her skills in biology to use for the Foundation.

While she is primarily based at Site 19, she has made consults at Site 17, Bio-Containment Areas █ and ██, and [DATA EXPUNGED].

In addition to her position as biological researcher, Doctor Light has also preformed the positions of naturalist, field agent, field medic, breakroom medic, surgeon, naturopathic physician, psychologist, accomplice, and distraction.

**To-Do List**
The Wonderland Mirrors/Accompanying Log
Haunted dentist's office
Living sound
"Glitch City"
The elephant in the room (-j)

The Gardens: Small patches of gardens that spring up around strange electrical equipment. No known ill or harmful effects, no foreign plants, just unusual cases of order. They tend to grow to a certain size and then stop.

The Iron Ghost: A formerly use iron mine haunted by a ghost. It's usually benevolent but stops being such when people try to take iron from the mine. Appeared while the mine was still in use. (Iron mined has weird properties?)

Orange Diamond Jewelery: A process invented by a company, LoveForever, to turn human ashes into diamond. Bad news: the resulting diamonds are haunted by the souls of the dead used. WHOOPS.
