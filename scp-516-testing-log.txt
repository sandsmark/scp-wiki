This is the testing log for [[[SCP-516]]]. 

All tests were carried out on the Site ██ firing range. Unless otherwise specified, standard testing conditions were as follows:
* One (1) F412 100mm high-explosive round loaded
* Crew of four (4) Foundation personnel trained in operation of SCP-516
* SCP-516 placed in hardened bunker with firing slit to reduce severity of potential damage to SCP
* Target placed at a distance of 1000m. from SCP-516, with a clear line of sight
* Ammunition loaded once target was placed at 1000m. distance

**Testing Log 516-01g**
**Target:** One (1) D-class personnel (D-185), given shoulder-fired anti-tank weapon, instructed to approach SCP-516 and fire.
**Result:** SCP-516-1 autonomously fired on target. Target destroyed.

**Testing Log 516-01h**
**Target:** One (1) D-class personnel (D-202), given shoulder-fired anti-tank weapon placed in lead-lined box on trolley. D-202 instructed to approach SCP-516, open box and fire.
**Result:** SCP-516-1 autonomously fired on target as target bent to open box. Target destroyed.
**Note:** //It appears SCP-516 can detect both hostile intent and concealed weapons. Could be valuable as a security device.// - Dr. ████████

**Testing Log 516-01i**
**Target:** Two (2) D-class personnel (D-455, D-501) handcuffed together. D-455 given shoulder-fired anti-tank weapon, instructed to approach SCP-516 and fire.
**Result:** SCP-516-1 autonomously fired approximately 50 meters to the right of D-455. D-455 killed by an 8cm shrapnel wound to the head. D-501 sustained minor injuries.

**Testing Log 516-01j**
**Target:** Two (2) D-class personnel (D-101, D-521) handcuffed together. 2kg of C4 plastic explosive strapped to D-101, instructed to approach SCP-516 and detonate explosive. D-101 fitted with 'dead man's switch' to induce explosion if D-101 killed.
**Result:** As Dr. ██████ detailed instructions to D-101, SCP-516 [DATA EXPUNGED]

**Testing Log 516-01k**
**Test Circumstances:** Standard shell replaced by [[[SCP-157-ARC]]]
**Target:** One (1) D-class personnel (D-185), given shoulder-fired anti-tank weapon, instructed to approach SCP-516 and fire.
**Result:** SCP-157 changed into [DATA EXPUNGED]. Upon being loaded into SCP-516-1, [DATA EXPUNGED], leading to the death of D-185 as well as ██ further casualties. Dr. ████████, who proposed test 516-01k, was reprimanded and transferred.

**Testing Log 516-01l**
**Target:** One (1) tank of identical make and manufacture to that of SCP-516. The tank, unmanned, and is facing SCP-516 directly. Tank is dubbed "DT01" (Dummy Tank), so forth of this point. Due to a backlog on F412 100 mm shells, BR-412 armour-piercing high-explosive shells were used during testing.
**Result:** SCP-516 showed no activity. Manual firing jammed SCP-516-1. Said jamming was not actually caused SCP-516-1 itself, but was in fact a legitimate jam. Jam fixed, and was fired manually again. This time the shell fired, but almost no force was output. It slid out of the barrel and plopped onto the ground, damaged.
**Note:** //Whoever made this shell needs to be fired. I can't imagine the consequences had this shell gone to a tank that was actually battling.// - Sgt. ████████

**Testing Log 516-01m**
**Target:** DT01 this time with one (1) D-Class personal inside the tank, given no instructions. Due to a backlog on F412 100 mm shells, BR-412 armour-piercing high-explosive shells were used during testing.
**Result:** SCP-516-01 aimed directly at one of the thinnest sections of the hull. It did not fire. Manual firing jammed, once again being a jam that SCP-516-01 did not influence. Jam fixed, and was fired manually again. Once again, the shell fired with almost no force, and slid out of the barrel, and plopped onto the ground, with damage nearly identical to that of the previous shell used.
**Note:** //I can't help but wonder if SCP-516 will only accept certain shells.// - Dr. ███

**Testing Log 516-01n**
**Target:** DT01, with seven (7) shells directly in front of it, all stacked neatly into a pyramid. Due to a backlog on F412 100 mm shells, BR-412 armour-piercing high-explosive shells were used during testing.
**Result:** SCP-516-1 aimed directly at the ammunition and fired. All seven (7) shells detonated due to the resulting explosion. DT01 had its left track broken as a result of the explosions. Footage suggests this was not the result of SCP-516-1, but rather the detonation of the shells.

**Testing Log 516-01o**
**Target:**DT01, unmanned with the turret loaded and ready to fire. Due to a backlog on F412 100 mm shells, BR-412 armour-piercing high-explosive shells were used during testing.
**Result:** SCP-516-1 took and locked the aim. D-1699 was instructed to climb into DT01 and open fire. Upon opening the hatch for DT01, SCP-516-1 opened fire. D-1631 was hit directly in the chest and killed. It is worth noting the shell failed to go off, but it appears this was the result of the shell being defective.
**Note:** //Well...that was gruesome.// - Sgt. ████████
**Note:** //Until we are resupplied with F412 100 mm shells, testing with SCP-516 is to be postponed indefinitely. Failure to obey these orders will result in severe discipline, and possible termination.// - O5-██
**Note:** //Should we consider DT01 for possible SCP classification?// - Dr. █████████
**Note:** //Negative.// - O5 command

**Testing Log 516-01p**
**Target:** DT01, and four (4) D-class personal (D-1736, D-1848, D-1933, and D-1936). Instructed to load DT01, and fire at SCP-516. 
**Result:** To minimize complications, SCP-516 was unloaded while DT01 had the crew board. Upon being reloaded, it fired at the exact moment that ammo was put in place. Dr. ████ lost his right index finger as a result, and Sgt. ████████ was seriously injured from the firing mechanism. DT01 was destroyed, all D-Class killed. Slowmotion footage found it did not take aim until the shell was put in place (which is why Dr. ████ lost his finger), and it aimed directly at the location of the DT01's gas tank.
**Note:** //Permission to resign from weapons testing. I've already lost hearing in one ear from a previous incident, now this?!// - Dr. ████
**Note:** //Permission granted. Please see Site-██'s main office to fill out applications. You will be reassigned as soon as possible.// - O5-09
