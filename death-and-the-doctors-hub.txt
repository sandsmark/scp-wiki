**//Death is not the greatest of evils: rather, it is to wish to die when one cannot.//**

> In the beginning, there was death. Then, and forever after. As creation's most ancient of beings, there are very few things the Brothers Death do not entirely understand. 
> 
> Oddly enough, one such thing are their own creations. 
> 
> Born from mass grave at a time of plague, the Children of the Barrow forever owe their allegiance to Death, they who gave them life. 
> 
> Born from conflict and into conflict, the Children of the Barrow seek always to create a world without it. A world where they would no longer be needed. 
> 
> Born with skill in medicine and healing, the Children of the Barrow name themselves plague doctors, a name fitting for more than one reason. For each plague they cure, another is brought forth from their very existence. 
> 
> The Children of the Barrow wish only to heal, but the Brothers Death may have other plans for them. 
> 
> As does life.
