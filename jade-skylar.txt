**Critter Profile: Sampson**
My first article that stuck! I first had the idea for Sampson after binging all of WWS one night. It started out as an Egyptian Golden Wolf who somehow mage his way to Oregon, and it took off from there. I posted a WIP picture of my first draft in a Discord server and got [[*user DarkStuff]] interested in it. He was a super big help in getting Sampson to his current state. Without him, I don't think I would have finished and posted my first article. Thanks again DS, you're the best!

**Critter Profile: Wobbles**
My first collab! I wrote this alongside [[*user Uncle Nicolini]] after he approached me one day and asked "Wanna collab on a Critter Profile?" and I said "Sure." I didn't know it at the time, but that was the start of a beautiful friendship. And a successful article! To be honest most of this was Nico's work. All I did was pitch an idea, and fill in some details. He wrote most of it, and put up with my lack of internet for a week. People seem to like Wobbles, since it's the second highest rated Critter Profile (You just can't beat the original, sadly) and my second highest rated article! Wobbles wouldn't be a thing without you Nico, you're an amazing author. (And friend!)

**A Walk Along The Riverside**
My first (somewhat successful) tale! This was my first entry into [[*user PeppersGhost]]'s [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-oct-hub Original Character Tournament]. This isn't my proudest work, to be honest. There are a lot of things I don't like about how I wrote it. Most of them stemming from myself not waiting to get critique. I might rewrite it one day, who knows?

**Nobody's Observations on Temporal Displacement, Family, and Waffles**
My first GoI format that isn't a Critter Profile! I wrote this with [[*user HotColes]] basically overnight. This is a sequel of sorts to Sampson's Critter Profile from the point of view of Nobody, continuing the story of Daniel, Jonathan, and Sampson. Most of the work was done by Cole, while I contributed by creating Sampson and making sure all the pieces fit together in the story. Thanks a bunch for inviting me to help Cole!

**SCP-4511: SWINE GOD**
My first SCP! :D This was a collaboration with my good friend [[*user Rounderhouse]] for [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/cliche-con-2019 Cliche Con 2019]. This is about a giant metal pig who demands a following, and won't take no for an answer. While I didn't contribute as much as I would of liked to 4511, I'm still confident in calling it my first SCP, and hey look, it's my first article to reach --100!-- 200!!! (Making it my highest rated article!) Even though Rounder is a [*http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/drannoyingdog/OH%20NO.PNG fucking dork], he's still a blast to work with. Thanks for writing my first SCP with me Rounder, you're a great friend!

**SCP-4512: A Goddamn Filthy Teleporting Party Pool**
Another collab! This was a joint effort between [[*user Woedenaz]], [[*user Rounderhouse]], and [[*user Uncle Nicolini]] that I sort of just latched onto. It's about a --Jimmy Buffett impersonator-- fake Hawaiian pool that demands you clean it. While I didn't do much for this, I still had a blast working with [*https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/458009355615207424/548171162497318912/Screen_Shot_2019-02-21_at_10.55.52_AM.png these dweebs]. Thanks for letting me help the small amount that I could nerds!

**SCP-4510: Avelar Express First Class Prime™!**
My entry for the SCPD draft swap! This was originally written by [[*user Rounderhouse]], and I got it for the SCPD draft swap.

**SCP-4206: The Weighing of the Heart**
Nico's entry for the SCPD draft swap! This one was originally a draft for my first scip that I had entered into the SCPD draft swap, and Nico got it and turned it into a disturbing article set in the End of Death canon.

**Critter Profile: The Polar Bear**
My third and dare I say, most important, Critter Profile! This is one part in a trilogy of articles that cover the Ursus Maritimus Incident and the origins of Wilson's Wildlife Solutions, including [http://www.scp-wiki.net/on-the-radar On the Radar], written by [[*user DarkStuff]] and [http://www.scp-wiki.net/uiu-file-2008-21 UIU File: 2008-21], written by [[*user Uncle Nicolini]].

**SCP-4509: The Windigo Cold Cases**
My first SCP in a long while. This one's about a gnome who murdered a large number of campers on a remote island off the coast of Michigan. I'm not quite happy with it, but I'm glad to put have something out. This also serves as a way to get two of my characters out there: a trans woman named Devorah Adani, and a mysterious Scotsman named Gregor McWilliam.

[[size 150%]]About Me[[/size]]
[[/=]]
----
Hi there! My name's Jade, but you probably know me as DrAnnoyingDog. I'm a bisexual enby from Michigan (currently living in California), and I also happen to be a furry UwU. I mostly focus on the Wilson's Wildlife Solutions Group of Interest (Cute anomalous animals are my jam). I've actually been a member of the site since January of 2016, but all of my successful articles have been written since my return to the site in July of 2018. I had previously posted an article before my return, but we aren't going to discuss that (Like ever).

Anyway, some of my favorite things are dogs, all the other animals, video games, Homestuck, tabletop RPGs, classic American muscle cars, art (mostly futuristic things in a past setting, a la Simon Stalenhag, but I also have a secret art kink[[footnote]]It's big ol' things looming in the distance, partially obstructed by clouds and fog.[[/footnote]]), and dogs!

So I'm writing this as an afterthought, but I really need to put this out there. No matter how many articles I write and upvotes I get, they will never be as important to me as the friends I've made in this community. To all my friends out there on the wiki and in the community, I love you, and I think I would've left the wiki long ago if it weren't for you guys. You're all awesome. ;~;
