[[include component:image-block name=DHAeslinger.png|caption=Dr. Daniel H. Aeslinger, Psy.D.|width=200px]]

**Employee Name:** Daniel Horatio Aeslinger, Psy.D. 

**Position:** Clinical Psychologist

**Department:** Mental Health Division

**Assignment:** Mobile Mental Health Evaluation Unit Sigma-5

**Profile:** Dr. Aeslinger gives a damn. In a world where you might get sucked into a parallel dimension filled with sentient couches, where around every corner might lurk an undead abomination stitched together from the mewling corpses of kittens sacrificed to some undying ancient evil, he cares. And he uses that caring attitude for the force of good. Or at least to provide a semi-bitching paycheck. 

Aeslinger is part of a small group of mental health professionals employed by The Foundation to evaluate and monitor the mental health of its employees. These men and women have nothing to gain and everything to lose as they subject themselves to repeated verbal bludgeoning, demonstrations of ignorance and passive-aggressive posturing.

If you have a psychological problem...if no one else can help...and if you can find them...maybe you can hire...The P-Team.

That one show totally stole that line from us.
