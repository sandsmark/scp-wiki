**Item #:** SCP-643

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-643 is to be held in a vat of liquid nitrogen with a volume of 8 liters. The ambient temperature of the room that SCP-643 is contained in must never exceed -10 degrees Celsius. Any circumstance resulting in the temperature rising above this threshold is to be treated as a potential containment breach. 

**Description:** SCP-643 is a collection of 79 chocolate candies. Individual instances of SCP-643 do not appear to have notable aesthetic differences from normal chocolates, and on average weigh between 100 and 160 grams. Instances of SCP-643 have a much lower melting point than ordinary chocolates, and have been observed to melt at temperatures as low as -15 degrees Celsius.

If any portion of SCP-643 moves into a liquid state, its anomalous properties will manifest. While it is in a liquid state, SCP-643 will become highly mobile and will move to the nearest edible substance. When a suitable substance is found, SCP-643 will move to cover it completely. Any substance that is covered with SCP-643 will begin to exude a strong, pleasant aroma. Organisms that consume SCP-643 become an instance of SCP-643-1. Instances of SCP-643-1 will posses the same desirability as any edible substance coated in SCP-643. However, note that SCP-643 does not cover the instance of SCP-643-1, which is digested normally. Any organism that views an instance of SCP-643-1 will attempt to consume it regardless of any previous relation. Organisms who consume portions of a SCP-643-1 instance will describe the experience as highly pleasurable.

SCP-643 was recovered from a freezer located inside a Bakery in Jacksonville, FL, where police had arrested 3 employees for cannibalizing their co-workers and several of the Bakeries patrons. Agents embedded in the local police department noted that SCP-643 had caused the incident, and recovered 79 instances of SCP-643 from the bakery. Witnesses were administered a Class-C amnesiac, and SCP-643 was classified as Safe on ██/██/1978.

> **Dr.B███:** Now, why did you try to eat D-1122?
> 
> **D-4312:** I couldn't help myself, man... she smelled so good, it reminded me of stuff my mom used to make.
> 
> **Dr.B███:** But surely you recognized that she was a human being?
> 
> **D-4312:** Yeah, but it felt... different. Like, it was okay to eat just a little, because it smelled so good. I just wanted a taste.
> 
> **Dr.B███:** If you just wanted a taste, why did you kill D-1122 and consume most of her face?
> 
> **D-4312:** Well, when I had the taste, it was so good. Like, all the best stuff. I just wanted more and more and more and (D-4312 continued to repeat this phrase for approximately ██ minutes.)
