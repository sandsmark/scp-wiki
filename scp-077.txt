**Item #:** SCP-077

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-077 is to be kept in Research Sector-██ on top of a 0.5 m high steel pedestal in a 3 m x 3 m bunker with 0.5 m thick steel walls.  The only entrance is through a locked steel hatch guarded at all times by 4 level One personnel and the shift is to switch every eight hours.

SCP-077 itself is covered in engravings in an ancient Celtic dialect.  These engravings have been filled with  black resin, which is a sort of tar sealant used in Ireland approximately 3,000 years ago.

Once daily at 2000 hours, one level Four personnel is to enter the containment area and read the engravings etched on SCP-077 in a low voice.  The entire process on average takes approximately sixty seconds.  As the engravings are written in ancient Celtic, at least 3 level Four researchers who can read it should be in Research Sector-██ at any given time, in case of emergency.

**Description:** If its engravings are not read aloud at least once in a 24-hour period, SCP-077 will begin to spread a “rot”, hereafter referred to as SCP-077-1.  When SCP-077-1 comes into contact with any solid, the affected material begins to dissolve at a constant rate of 50cm/s.  SCP-077-1 cannot be stopped by any known means, other than reading SCP-077’s engravings.  Once this happens, the rot simply vanishes, although any material it has disintegrated remains gone.

SCP-077 is a human skull (carbon dating places it at ~3,500 years old).  It was recovered from the █████ █████████ in ███████.  Local natives had built a shrine to it, and were performing occult rituals to it routinely at midnight.  Recovery of the object was going as planned until, en route to Research Sector-██, SCP-077 began exuding SCP-077-1, resulting in the loss of the cargo truck it was being transported in, six D-class personnel, and Agents ███ and ██████.  It took seven hours for assistance to arrive, by which time SCP-077-1 had spread to a radius of 12.6 kilometers (approximately 10 miles).  Agent █████ was able to [DATA EXPUNGED].  The resulting crater was explained as a meteorite and the area has since been under SCP watch.

An experiment using two D-class personnel was performed by Dr. ████, under highly controlled circumstances.  At all times, an approved “reader” was on hand, with a copy of SCP-077’s engravings, and positioned far enough [DATA EXPUNGED]

**Experiment Log 077-01:** 
**Date:** 04–26-19██
**Subject:** D-Class personnel █████ █████ (D-077-01)
**Procedure:** Subject was exposed to SCP-077-1, being strapped firmly in place, and having the SCP resting in his lap.  Subject was fully conscious and lucid for the duration of the test, until [DATA EXPUNGED]
**Details:**  Subject reported pain as “excruciating”, and after ██ seconds was completely incoherent.  No blood was able to escape from the [DATA EXPUNGED]

**Experiment Log 077-02:** 
**Date:** 04-26-19██
**Subject:** D-class personnel ██ ███████ (D-077-02)
**Procedure:**  Subject was exposed to SCP-077-1, being strapped firmly in place, and having the SCP at a sufficient distance to allow it to reach his mid-thigh before the "reader" would be finished with the 60-second chant.  Subject was fully conscious and lucid for the duration of the test.
**Details:**  Subject reported pain similarly to test subject D-077-01.  Once SCP-077-1 reached his mid-thigh, and the reading was complete, the destruction of flesh ceased instantly.  Subject died from exsanguination shortly thereafter.

**Addendum-077-01:** //It is my suggestion that SCP-077 be destroyed.  Something like this is simply too unstable and potentially devastating to be used, even as an agent of war.
05-██//
**Addendum-077-02:** //O5-██, we have too little data regarding SCP-077 at present to safely risk destroying it.  I enjoy senseless destruction as much as anyone here, but how do we know the ashes of SCP-077 won't simply begin spreading SCP-077-1 after 24 hours of us not reading to it?  I require further testing of this SCP before I would even consider destroying it.  
Dr. ████//
