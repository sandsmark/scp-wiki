**Item #:** SCP-077

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-077 is to be kept in Research Sector-██ on top of a 0.5 m high steel pedestal in a 3 m^^2^^  bunker with 0.5 m thick steel walls.  The only entrance is through a locked steel hatch guarded at all times by 2 level One personnel and the shift is to switch every eight hours.

Every three hours, one level Two personnel is to enter the containment area and read aloud the Ogham runes etched on SCP-077.  The reading takes approximately sixty seconds. The runes change every lunar month, as well as at the winter and summer solstices, the spring and autumn equinoxes, and whenever a partial, annular, or total solar or lunar eclipse is visible from Ireland; cameras are mounted to record any other changes.

The reading must be performed by a conscious individual who understands the meaning of the runes being read and who is able to pronounce them correctly. To facilitate this, Foundation linguists transcribe the runes into phonetic English and provide literal and idiomatic translations; dialect coaching is available if necessary. A boom mic connected to a speech recognition system verifies that all pronunciation is within standards.

If its engravings are not read aloud at least once within a 24-hour period, SCP-077 will begin to produce a “rot”, hereafter referred to as SCP-077-1.  SCP-077-1 is a light gray vapor resembling smoke, which disintegrates all non-living solid or particulate materials (except SCP-077 itself) at a constant rate of 50cm^3/s, and all living materials at a constant rate of 10 cm^3/s. SCP-077-1 cannot be stopped by any known means other than reading SCP-077’s engravings.

**Description:** SCP-077 is the top half of a human skull engraved with Ogham runes (carbon-dating places it at ~3,500 years old, which is ~1,500 years older than Ogham); the runes are filled with black resin.  It was recovered from the █████ █████████ in ███████.  Local natives had built a shrine to it, and were performing occult rituals to it each midnight.  Recovery of the object was going as planned until, while en route to Research Sector-██, SCP-077 began exuding SCP-077-1, resulting in the loss of the cargo truck it was being transported in, six D-class personnel, and Agents ███ and ██████.  It took seven hours for assistance to arrive, by which time SCP-077-1 had spread to a radius of 12.6 kilometers (approximately 10 miles).  Agent █████ was able to [DATA EXPUNGED].  The resulting crater was explained as a meteorite and the area has since been under SCP watch.

An experiment using one D-class personnel was performed by Dr. Jade, under highly controlled circumstances.  At all times, an approved “reader” was on hand, with a copy of SCP-077’s engravings, and positioned far enough [DATA EXPUNGED]

**Experiment Log 077-01:** 

**Date:** 04–26-19██
**Subject:** D-Class personnel █████ █████ (D-077-01)
**Procedure:** Subject was exposed to SCP-077-1, being strapped firmly in place, and having the SCP resting in his lap.  Subject was fully conscious and lucid for the duration of the test, until [DATA EXPUNGED]
**Details:**  Subject reported pain as “excruciating”, and after ██ seconds was completely incoherent.  No blood was able to escape from the [DATA EXPUNGED]
