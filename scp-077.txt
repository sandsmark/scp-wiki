**Item #:** SCP-077

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-077 is to be kept in Research Sector-██ on top of a 0.5 m steel pedestal in a 3 m x 3 m x 3 m chamber with 0.5 m thick steel-reinforced walls. The reinforced steel hatch-door to the chamber is to comply with AH37-Protocol, and is to be guarded at all times by two (2) Level-1 personnel. A boom mic connected to a speech recognition system is to be used to verify that all pronunciation is within standards. A camera is to be mounted within the chamber to record any changes.

Every twelve (12) hours, a minimum of one (1),  but a preferably three (3), trained D-Class personnel are to enter the containment area and, in a loud, clear voice, read the Ogham runes etched onto SCP-077 in unison. The reading must be performed by individuals who understand the full meaning of the runes being read, and who are able to pronounce the entirety of the reading correctly. 

All personnel must undergo a full-day training session with Foundation linguists for pronunciation, reading, and dialect coaching. A minimum of twelve (12) D-Class personnel are to be trained or undergoing training at any one time; trained D-Class personnel are exempt from termination until such time as they have been replaced. Foundation linguists are to be available at all times, in case of an unexpected rune change. Every new set of runes is to be transcribed into phonetic English, and provided with literal and idiomatic translations as quickly as possible; see documents 077-██████ through ██████ for archived translations.

**Description:** SCP-077 appears to be the top half of a human skull engraved with Ogham runes,  each filled with a black resin. The runes change every lunar month (defined by the full moon rising above the horizon in Ireland), as well as at the winter and summer solstices, the spring and autumn equinoxes, and whenever a partial, annular, or total solar or lunar eclipse is visible from Ireland.

If these engravings are not read aloud at least once within a 24-hour period, the eye sockets and nasal cavity of SCP-077 will emit SCP-077-1 within an 18-cm-thick disc centered radially on the skull's braincase and oriented along the axis of the eye sockets' line of sight. SCP-077-1 is [DATA EXPUNGED].

Performing a reading of SCP-077's engravings seems to have roughly a 5% mortality rate, though a single reading has never produced more than one casualty. Surviving readers report a variety of effects immediately following a reading of SCP-077, including nausea, increased physical vigor, high adrenaline levels, or various sudden strong emotions, including anger, sorrow, jealousy, and euphoria. Many readers, however, have reported none of these effects, even after several readings.


**Addendum 077-01:**
The artifact was recovered from the █████ █████████ in ███████. Locals had built a shrine around the artifact, in which upwards of [REDACTED] participants would engage in a nightly ritual. Recovery of the object was going as planned until, while en route to Research Sector-██, SCP-077 began [DATA EXPUNGED] resulting in the loss of the cargo truck it was being transported in, six D-Class personnel, and Agents ███ and ██████. It took ███ minutes for assistance to arrive, by which time SCP-077-1 had [DATA EXPUNGED]. The resulting crater was explained as a meteorite and the area has since been under Foundation watch.

**Addendum 077-02:**
//SCP-077's effect has shown some anomalous properties when exposed to living tissue. [DATA EXPUNGED].  Further testing is not advised.
