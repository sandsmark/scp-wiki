**Item #:** SCP-077

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-077 is to be kept in Area-██ in a 10 m x 10 m concrete bunker with 1.5 m thick steel walls, on top of a 1 m high steel pedestal.  The only entrance is through a locked steel hatch guarded at all times by 4 level One personnel and the shift is to switch every eight hours.

SCP-077 itself is covered in engravings in an ancient dialect of Japanese.  These engravings have been filled with a black resin, which has been found to be a sort of tar sealant used in Japan approximately 3,000 years ago.

Once daily at 2000 hours, one level Four personnel is to enter the containment area and read the engravings etched on SCP-077 in a low voice.  The entire process on average takes approximately sixty seconds.  As the engravings are written in an ancient dialect of Japanese at least 3 level Four researchers who can read it should be in Area-██ at any given time, in case of emergency.

**Description:** SCP-077 is a human skull (carbon dating places it at ~3,500 years old).  It was recovered from the █████ █████████ in ██████.  Local natives had built a shrine to it, and were performing occult rituals to it nightly at midnight.  SCP agent ██████ first became suspicious about the object from the amount of fear locals showed regarding it.

If its engravings are not read aloud at least once in a 24-hour period, SCP-077 will begin to spread a “rot”, hereafter referred to as SCP-077-1.  When SCP-077-1 comes into contact with any solid, the affected material begins to dissolve at a constant rate of 0.2cm/s.  SCP-077-1 cannot be stopped by any known means, other than reading SCP-077’s engravings.  Once this happens, the rot simply vanishes, although any material it has eaten through remains gone.

An experiment using █ D-class personnel was performed by Dr. ████, under highly controlled circumstances.  At all times, an approved “reader” was on hand, with a copy of SCP-077’s runes, and positioned far enough [DATA EXPUNGED]
