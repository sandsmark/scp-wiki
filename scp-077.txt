**Item #:** SCP-077

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-077 is to be kept in Research Sector-██ on top of a 0.5m steel pedestal in a 3m x 3m x 3m chamber with 0.5 m thick steel-reinforced walls. The reinforced steel hatch-door to the chamber is to comply with AH37-Protocol, and is to be guarded at all times by two (2) Level-1 personnel. A boom mic connected to a speech recognition system is to be used to verify that all pronunciation is within standards. A camera is to be mounted within the chamber to record any changes.

Every twelve (12) hours, a minimum of one (1),  but a prefered number of (3) trained D-Class personnel are to enter the containment area and in a loud, clear voice read the Ogham runes etched onto SCP-077 in unison. The reading must be performed by an individual who understands the full meaning of the runes being read, and who is able to pronounce the entirety of the reading correctly. 

D-Class personnel assigned to this project are to be hand-picked by O5-█. All personnel must undergo a full-day training session with Foundation linguists for pronounciation, reading, and dialect coaching. A minimum of twelve (12) D-Personnel are to be trained or undergoing training at any one time. Foundation linguists are to be available 24-hours, in case of an unexpected rune change. Every new set of runes is to be to transcribed into phonetic English, and provided with literal and idiomatic translations as quickly as possible.

**Description:** SCP-077 appears to be the top half of a human skull engraved with Ogham runes,  each filled with a black resin. The runes change every lunar month, as well as at the winter and summer solstices, the spring and autumn equinoxes, and whenever a partial, annular, or total solar or lunar eclipse is visible from Ireland.

If these engravings are not read aloud at least once within a 24-hour period, SCP-077 will begin to produce a light gray vapor which disintegrates all non-living solid or particulate materials (except SCP-077 itself) at a constant rate of 11cm^3/s, and all living materials at a constant rate of 6cm^3/s. This effect has thus far not been succesfully stopped by any means other than reading SCP-077’s engravings.

Performing a reading of SCP-077's engravings seems to have roughly a 27%% mortality rate, though a single reading has never produced more than one casualty. Surviving readers report a variety of effects immediately following a reading of SCP-077, including nausea, increased physical vigor, high adrenaline levels, or various sudden strong emotions including anger, sorrow, jealousy, and euphoria. Many readers however, have reported none of these effects, even after several readings.


**Addendum 007-01:**
The artifact was recovered from the █████ █████████ in ███████. Locals had built a shrine around the artifact, in which upwards of [REDACTED] participants would engage in a nightly ritual. Recovery of the object was going as planned until while en route to Research Sector-██, SCP-077 began exuding SCP-077-1, resulting in the loss of the cargo truck it was being transported in, six D-class personnel, and Agents ███ and ██████. It took [REDACTED] hours for assistance to arrive, by which time SCP-077-1 had spread to a radius of 7 kilometers. Agent █████ was able to [DATA EXPUNGED]. The resulting crater was explained as a meteorite and the area has since been under SCP watch.
