**Special Containment Procedures:** Containment Site-57 has been established around SCP-5536 with a radius of approximately 2 km. The perimeter around SCP-5536 is to be routinely patrolled by at least 20 armed security personnel. Any irregular activity outside of SCP-5536's established pattern is to be immediately reported to Site Director Pendleton. The following astronomical events must have the listed measurements taken:
* **Solar eclipse:** All flowers in bloom on SCP-5536's trilithons must have liquid mercury applied and SCP-5536-3 transported to the Site-57 Observatory.
* **Lunar eclipse:** Terminate SCP-5536-3 through the method of decapitation.

Any and all attempts to visually document SCP-5536 are strictly prohibited. 

SCP-5536-3 is to be kept in a standard 4 × 4 × 3 m windowless containment cell in Site-57 and provided monthly psychological evaluation. SCP-5536-3 must never be exposed to sunlight or any other kind of ultraviolet radiation. SCP-5536-3 is allowed restricted socialization privileges with appointed personnel and permission to roam designated areas of the site under the supervision of a bodyguard due to cooperative behaviour.

In response of SCP-5536-3's anomalous properties, all lighting in Site-57 has been replaced with non-UV light bulbs. Any requests to change said protocols are to be ignored.

**Description:** SCP-5536 is a stone monument commonly known as "Stonehenge," located in Wiltshire, England. Following the Ansuman Incident, each of the trilithons has exhibited dangerously high levels of ultraviolet and gamma radiation, capable of deteriorating any biological composition and damaging any artificial equipment within 9.5 meters. The large amounts of radiation has also created an optical anomaly in its centre, a construct of a glowing purple cube (approximately 5 m from each side) that remains the same even if observed from different angles. 

The following is the established pattern of SCP-5536's anomalous activity: 
* **Day cycle:** 10-20 SCP-5536-2 instances will emerge and begin circling the trilithons until sundown.
* **Night cycle:** Vines will sprout from and envelop every trilithon, with hundreds of an unknown species of white flower bulbs[[footnote]]Hypothesised to be a mutation between the Madonna lily (//Lilium candidum//) and the pheasant's eye (//Narcissus poeticus//).[[/footnote]] embedded on each one. Each of these flower bulbs measure around 30 cm in length and 19 cm in width. Any attempts to remove or water them have have resulted in the plant's expiration.
* **Solar eclipse:** The white flowers will bloom open, revealing their mouths.
* **Lunar eclipse:** All objects within a 3 km radius that has a volume of 729 m^^3^^ or more will experience spacial and reality displacements, constantly transforming the interior of the object to a 5-dimensional space. Every human also within that range will suddenly be transported to the immediate vicinity of SCP-5536's trilithons. 100-250 instances of SCP-5536-2 will emerge from SCP-5536. 

Any visual depiction of SCP-5536 following the Ansuman incident can cause severe hazardous properties when viewed in any way, ranging from permanent brain damage to ##EF820D|[D####darksalmon|ATA## ##orange|EX####yellow|P####darkorange|UNGED]##. 

SCP-5536-2 is the designation for a highly hostile species of humanoid entities comprised of pure rubedo[[footnote]]A mineral which resulted from the natural combination of obsidian, brimstone, and [REDACTED]. Currently used by the Foundation for emergency heating.[[/footnote]] that routinely emerge from SCP-5536 during daylight hours. Each instance is approximately 1.9 m in height. SCP-5536's sole facial feature is a luminescent orange point in the forehead region. 

SCP-5536-2 instances possess significant durability, speed, and strength, requiring large amounts of explosives to properly be neutralised. All attempts to capture any instances so far have failed, due to their active area seemingly limited to 30 meters away from SCP-5536, immediately crumbling to shards once stepping out of range. SCP-5536-2 is currently believed to be non-sapient, acting instead like a hive mind and following simple orders.

SCP-5536-3 (formerly known as Thorin Wagner) is a male human of Scottish descent. Records indicate that SCP-5536-3 was born on ████, making him ██ years old during acquisition. As of the writing of this report, his current height is 1.54 m. 

When exposed to any ultraviolet radiation, SCP-5536-3 will cause his surrounding area (approximately 5 m) to spontaneously combust, injuring himself in the process. This effect would continue until SCP-5536-3 is removed from the exposure.

SCP-5536-3's second anomalous property manifests during periods of sleep. During the first 10 minutes of sleep, SCP-5536-3's brain activity gradually increases until it is 10 times stronger than the average theta brainwaves (about 50-90 Hz). After that point, SCP-5536-3 will experience mild epileptic seizures lasting usually between 7-8 hours, during which he cannot be awakened with any known methods. 

After awakening, SCP-5536-3 would usually express discomfort about his dreams before continuing with his daily activities in containment. If asked to describe the nature of his dreams, SCP-5536-3 will either ramble in --an unknown language-- Wuski[[footnote]]An ancient dialect which originated from [REDACTED], Russia. The Foundation are currently searching for any of its native speakers.[[/footnote]] for 5 hours or recite different 8-digit numbers for 2 hours. All 8-digit numbers given are dates that have been proven to correlate with past and future astronomical events. 
[[size 15%]]##white|--SCP-5536-4 is a male human of unknown age and descent. It has currently shown no anomalous properties aside from its ability to safely emerge from SCP-5536. SCP-5536-4 claims to be an agent of GoI #1945[[footnote]]--"Archon Magistratum".--[[/footnote]] under the codenames "Dorren Handel" and "Doorhandle."--##[[/size]] 
**Addendum 5536.a:** Discovery 

SCP-5536 was discovered on 5 July 2020 (the Ansuman Incident) during a penumbral lunar eclipse in the Wiltshire area. The Foundation was informed about the situation through several reports from social media. MTF Epsilon-6 ("Village Idiots")[[footnote]]A task force specialising in the investigation, containment, and subsequent cleanup of anomalies in rural and suburban environments.[[/footnote]] was quickly deployed to the location where they found approximately 50 tourists being killed by hundreds of SCP-5536-2 instances. At least 200 other tourists were also spotted attempting to flee the location with some of them collapsing after succumbing to SCP-5536's radiation.

As the MTF's members dismounted from their vehicles and dispatched various SCP-5536-2 instances, [[size 0%]]SCP-5536-4[[/size]]Agent Dorren Handel emerged from SCP-5536's centre, bringing an unconscious SCP-5536-3 and placing him beside the other injured tourists before aiding the MTF members. Nearly a hundred of SCP-5536-2 instances were ##blue|te####cornflowerblue|r####darkblue|mi####skyblue|n####darkblue|at####008ECC|ed##, with the surviving few immediately retreating back to the centre of SCP-5536, vanishing in the optical anomaly.

75 people were killed in the resulting event, 2 of which were identified to be SCP-5536-3's parents. 19 other victims shortly expired due to radiation and one additional victim died while on the way to the hospital when he attempted to show medical personnel a photo of SCP-5536 that he took. 

All 180 survivors were gathered in a refuge centre and amnesticized. The general public was later given the cover story that the incident was the result of several unaccounted solar flares damaging the ozone layers. UNESCO officials would also prohibit any cultural and tourism activity on Wiltshire.

A security perimeter surrounding SCP-5536 would then be established. After 2 weeks of negotiation with UNESCO and GOC officials, the Foundation was finally given permission to develop it to Containment Site-57 under the guise of a temporary UNESCO reclamation site. 

[[collapsible show="Extra Appendix: Circumstance of SCP-5536-3's Acquisition" hide="Close Appendix" hideLocation="both"]]

During the 19 days following the Ansuman Incident, SCP-5536-3 had not developed any anomalous properties. At that point in time, SCP-5536-3 had been staying at a refuge centre in Wiltshire and was about to be recovered by his aunt to live with her.

On 24 July 2020, at 11:30 AM, as SCP-5536-3 exited the centre to greet her at the entrance, the area around him instantly combusted, heavily injuring a security officer and SCP-5536-3's aunt. SCP-5536-3 himself was slightly injured on the facial area, but received serious burns on his arms and torso. Reports show that the combustion lasted for 2 minutes, during which the entrance burnt to the ground and SCP-5536-3 fled the scene.

[[size 0%]]SCP-5536-4 and Agent Kabarat[[/size]]Two Foundation agents, who had been sent to the centre under the pretense of additional security, quickly secured the victims and located SCP-5536-3 in a nearby bathroom, having an epileptic seizure. The Foundation was later informed of the situation and deployed a mobile containment unit, leading to SCP-5536-3's acquisition. 

The victims and witnesses of said acquisition were amnesticized, including SCP-5536-3's aunt, who was also given a cover story that her nephew had been immolated in the incident.

The following interview was conducted in Site-57 after SCP-5536-3 regained consciousness and treated for his injuries.

> 
> **Dr. Natt:** Good. So, first question, do you remember anything of significance leading to the incident which occurred today?
> 
> **SCP-5536-3:** W-well, my aunt was coming to drive me to her house so I can stay there, 'cause s-s-she said my parents died when Stonehenge, you know, blew up a few weeks ago.
> 
> **Dr. Natt:** I see. (//Taking down notes//) Next, do you have any other relatives besides your aunt?
> 
> **SCP-5536-3:** No. G-Grandpa died before I was born, and Grandma passed away just a year ago. (//Sniffs//) Mom didn't have any siblings, and her parents died in Vietnam. (//Pauses//) Aunt ██████'s okay, right?
> 
> **Dr. Natt:** She's safe, don't worry. She's already back at her home.
> 
> **SCP-5536-3:** Wait, what? B-but I thought I was gonna go with her! I am going home after this, right?
> 
> **Dr. Natt:** Well, Thorin, you see, (//breathes//) we can't exactly let you out right now. You... wouldn't be safe out there.
>

On 16 May 2022, a full lunar eclipse took place in the Wiltshire area, followed shortly by a containment breach in Site-57. Several areas of Site-57 experienced multiple reality and spacial displacements, transforming the interior architecture of Site-57 and causing several Foundation personnel to be instantly transported to the immediate vicinity of SCP-5536 and attacked by hundreds of emerging SCP-5536-2 instances.

The following are the records that were managed to be recovered from the incident.

The lunar eclipse ended shortly afterwards. The interior of Site-57 quickly reverted back to its original state and all the SCP-5000-2 instances marched back to the middle of SCP-5000, each of them vanishing instantly inside the light. 

A rescue team shortly arrived and managed to recover 89 Foundation personnel. 38 other personnel were confirmed to be deceased and 4 are currently missing.

SCP-5000-3 would rematerialise in his cell the next morning without any injuries. The following is an excerpt from the post-incident interview.

> **Date:** 17-05-2022
> 
> **Interviewer:** Dr. Nunnally Natt 
> 
> **Interviewee:** SCP-5000-3 
> 
> ----
> 
> **[BEGIN LOG]** 
> 
> **Dr. Natt:** SCP-5000-3, we are conducting this interview to close out our investigation of the incident which took place on 16th of May that resulted in the deaths of many staff members. Do you have any comments to make? 
> 
> **SCP-5000-3:** Yes, actually. This interview will be available to Level 5 personnel and above, correct? 
> 
> **Dr. Natt:** I'm not at liberty do disclose that inf- 
> 
> **SCP-5000-3:** I'll take that as a yes. That means I can only give you the rough outlines. 
> 
> **Dr. Natt:** If what you have is enough, then it shouldn't be a problem.
> 
> **SCP-5000-3:** Very well. (//Pauses//) Even though I am not responsible for such a horrible incident, I deeply apologize for it, as the perpetrators are some of my close colleagues. 
> 
> **Dr. Natt:** When you say "colleagues," do you mean those of the same status as you? So if there are others, does this mean it's happening in many places?
> 
> **SCP-5000-3:** Countless of them, not just ours. In places you wouldn't even know existed. 
> 
> **Dr. Natt:** I see. In one of your interviews, you also mentioned something along the lines of "becoming a king in a span of a century." Now, you sure don't look a quarter of that age. 
> 
> **SCP-5000-3:** Physically, no. This body of the child that I once was do not reflect my mental and spiritual experience. Though if you were to ask me of my age, I would reply that I am, without a doubt, 361 years old. 
> 
> **Dr. Natt:** (//Pauses//) Are you still Thorin? The boy that we brought here two years ago?
> 
> **SCP-5000-3:** I wish I could say that. But you know how things are. 
> 
> **Dr. Natt:** Right... Now, if what you said is true, we are to terminate you on every lunar eclipse to prevent the more disastrous effects of SCP-5000's anomalous properties. Since your statement has been proven to be correct, I would also like to request that you give us information on the actions to be taken during other astronomical events.
> 
> **SCP-5000-3:** Doctor, what makes you think whatever comes out of my mouth is the truth?
> 
> **Dr. Natt:** Because it seems like you're actually trying to help us. 
> 
> **SCP-5000-3:** (//Sighs//) Then I shall give. You know those flowers that sprout up and wrap around the trilithons every night? 
> 
> **Dr. Natt:** Yes, I am aware that giving them any liquid has no effect on their growth.
> 
> **SCP-5000-3:** Good. Now you might want to stock up on liquid mercury for the preparation of a solar eclipse.
> 
> **Dr. Natt:** Do we... water them with it? 
> 
> **SCP-5000-3:** (//Laughs heartily//) Goodness no, Doctor! You'll kill them! Help them //drink,// for they will bloom with opened mouths. 
> 
>  **Dr. Natt:** All... right, then. 
> 
> **SCP-5000-3:** That's all I could give you for now. And Doctor, if it's not too much to ask, I would like to ask of you to prepare a windowed room for me during the solar eclipses. Is that an even trade? 
> 
>  **Dr. Natt:** Is that request necessary?
> 
> **SCP-5000-3:** Yes, for all of you, but mostly for myself.
> 
>  **Dr. Natt:** I'll see what I can do. 
> 
> **SCP-5000-3:** Thank you, Doctor. 
> 
> **[END LOG]** 

A search mission was also intiated to relocate Agent Dorren Handel, concluding on that same day when he was found baking an unknown food product in the site cafeteria. Dr. Nunnally Natt was assigned to interview Agent Handel several minutes later in the site's safe room.

> 
> **[BEGIN LOG]** 
> 
> **Dr. Natt:** So, Agent Handel, about yesterday... 
> 
> **Agent Handel:** First off, it's a German name. Yes, I know it sounds like a pun. Also, the kid is safe, don't worry. 
> 
> **Dr. Natt:** Yes, I'm aware of that. That's not what I'm here for, though.
> 
> **Agent Handel:** Oh yeah. Sorry for the ##cornflowerblue|pie## thing. They might smell weird, but trust me, they're perfectly edible.
> 
> **Dr. Natt:** (//Scratches her head//) I hope that doesn't have anything to do with whatever "Archon" you're working for.
> 
> **Agent Handel:** (//Pauses//) Okay, who snitched on me? 
> 
> **Dr. Natt:** (//Chuckles//) Relax. It's an O5. She told me to watch a few recordings yesterday.
> 
> **Agent Handel:** Dang. Is she listening to this right now?
> 
> //Dr. Natt motions her hand to the hidden camera.//
> 
> **Agent Handel:** Are they actually afraid to come into contact with other anomalies?
> 
> **Dr. Natt:** They're just cautious, that's all.
> 
> **Agent Handel:** Doctor, I'm gonna be honest with you. I'm not a reality bender or a Type Green, whatever you want to call it.
> 
> **Dr. Natt:** So I've heard. 
> 
> **Agent Handel:** Also, I'm not //actually// German, though I do speak it. (//Looks around the room//) To tell you the truth, working with the Foundation has been quite **éta rép[[size 0%]]{So tired.}[[/size]]sax**. But I'm still gonna finish my mission, and that includes working with you. I can safely say that most of you are pretty competent. I also realize that both of our bosses have the same goal, to protect our existence.
> 
> **Dr. Natt:** I sure hope my bosses think the same too, but I'm afraid that, during these two years, you're already aware on how we do things here.
> 
> **Agent Handel:** (//Sighs//) So, what do they plan to do to me? Launch me to the sun? Blast me with SRAs? Lock me up along with their anomalous[[size 5%]]##gainsboro|animated factory##[[/size]]porn? 
> 
> **Dr. Natt:** (//Laughs and leans back on her chair//) No, nothing like that. They're probably more interested on finding out more about your superiors. 
> 
> **Agent Handel:** Does that mean they'll finally be sending troops to Stonehenge?
> 
> **Dr. Natt:** You know that we can't afford to do that without proper research, right? Besides, you could definitely kill me before I blink and send some yourself.
> 
> **Agent Handel:** That wouldn't be //ethical//, Doctor. 
> 
> **Dr. Natt:** You're starting to sound like a human. 
> 
> **Agent Handel:** Yep. And I hate it. 
> 
> **Dr. Natt:** (//Sits upright//) Look, I know it won't sound professional, but I want to thank you for saving our asses. Only a dumbass would take that for granted. I made sure that the O5 will at least consider helping you. They said they'll hold a vote to decide if this mission of yours is worth the trouble.
> 
> **Agent Handel:** Thanks. Much appreciated. Rest assured, my missions are for a good cause.
> 
> **Dr. Natt:** You're welcome. They already have countermeasures though, just in case you need to be put down.
> 
> **Agent Handel:** I know. 
> 
> //Agent Handel dematerialises from his seat.// 
> 
> **Dr. Natt:** That concludes the interview. 
> 
> **[END LOG]**
> 
> ----
> 
> **Interviewer's Notes:** //Agent Handel is to be informed immediately about the results of the vote, whenever that happens. I don't care if any of you thinks his body's composed of hellfire or if he's a lobotomized Type Green. We owe him. Don't forget that.//

{{This is Agent ##darkblue|Doorhandle##, giving a full report.}}

{{##darkblue|I##'ve found the gateway. It is located in the 11th Level (Humanity) in Wiltshire, England, Europe, on Earth, inside the Milkyway. It is a monument of stone monoliths that the humans previously called "Stonehenge". The only safe time to enter through it is on the lunar and solar eclipses.}}

{{According to the information ##darkblue|I##'ve gotten, the gateway leads to the place where the prisoners escaped to. If a few other sources are also to be believed, that its connection spans through infinite realities and universes, we might have another Infinitum crisis on our hands.}}

{{There's also a **Fier** here. ##crimson|Thorin Wagner##, male, born on 19 ADG. ##crimson|He## is currently not a threat and has proven to be cooperative in ##darkblue|my## mission, but ##darkblue|I## worry that, since ##crimson|his## body doesn't support ##crimson|his## power, ##crimson|he## might trigger a planetary extinction event in about 10 years. ##darkblue|I## suggest moving ##crimson|him## to the 3rd Level (Arak) when ##crimson|his## time comes.}}

{{During these past 2 years, ##darkblue|I## have been cooperating with one of Humanity's Reclamation Groups, the SCP Foundation. From what ##darkblue|I##'ve seen so far, they are mostly able to handle some of the 12th and 13th Level threats, and their leaders are currently deciding on the best course of action involving us, though ##darkblue|I## still plan on checking out the Serpent's Hand. If everything goes well, ##darkblue|I## shall be reporting back to ##FCD12A|you## soon.[[size 0%]]I'll try my best to come back on **Klannux** this year, though I can't really guarantee it. I'll still send a postcard to you and Arké-né just in case. Love you! :D[[/size]]}}
