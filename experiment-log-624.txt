//**Note:** This is a test log of [[[SCP-624]]] by Site ██ personnel and visiting staff to scope SCP-624's abilities. Please remember that SCP-624 is not a toy and that you must do these tests at your own risk. -Dr. Z████████// 

**Warning:** Personnel who do not listen to music, do not like music, or have zero musical influences are not allowed to test SCP-624. 

**Instructions for testing SCP-624:**

Charge SCP-624 from a computer or personal mp3 player charger. An iPod-only charger will not work. Hook up a pair of headphones to SCP-624 and power it on. Ear buds, noise cancellation headphones, and speakers will not work. Record your findings in the following format:

**Subject:** Dr. Z████████. Dr. Z████████ makes electronic music in his off-time.
**Artist Profile:** “Spaztique Explosive formed in the early 2000s, combing punk, classical music, and electronica. Has toured with such bands as Mindless Self Indulgence, Bjork, and Goldfrapp. Lead singer D████ Z████████ died in 20██ due to ███████ addiction and was replaced by Ian Watkins of lostprophets fame.
**Music Results:** Music is very eclectic, ranging from fast-paced electronic punk to slower orchestral pieces. Lyrics are very precise and concrete. Most songs range between three to five minutes. Dr. Z████████’s playlist contains four hundred and one (401) tracks. Subject appeared to be very pleased with the results.
**Subject Comments:** //This all sounds far better than anything I’ve made in real life, and... Wait. I die of a ███████ overdose?!//

------

**Subject:** Agent S██████. Subject's favorite music include late 60s to early 80s rock.
**Artist Profile:** The Frank S██████ Experience first exploded onto the scenes in the late 60s, replacing Jimi Hendrix during Woodstock 69. Frank S██████’s first band, Superloverboy, broke up after creative differences. Frank S██████ went on to replace Jason Newsted of Metallica.
**Music Results:** Music is mostly psychedelic rock, akin to Jimi Hendrix or Cream, but also ranges to music akin to Pink Floyd and Neil-Peart-era Rush. Lyrics tend to be very abstract, save for a few love songs and sci-fi prog-rock epics. Because of their lengthy nature, ranging from eight to thirty minutes, there are only a hundred and six (106) tracks. Subject was amused, but mildly disappointed at the same time. 
**Subject Comments:** //I’d make this? No way. I know there’s a limit on how many Fuzz pedals you can use, and I would never use that much reverb or flange... Ok, maybe just a little, but on every song? Please!//

------

//**Note:** Further testing encouraged by all Site ██ personnel. --A "Best of" soundtrack is currently being compiled to boost morale among researchers.-- -Dr. Z████████//

//**Note:** Dr. Z████████, as you mentioned before, SCP-624 is not a toy. All testing of SCP-624 should be for research only, in order to inspect SCP-624's range of abilities. -Dr. D███, Level 4 Security//

**Subject:** Dr. Zeitgeistenburgherson
**Artist Profile:** The only musician, to this date, to pioneer the genre of "classical snuff," "Symphony Number 2 in B Minor for Orchestra and Firing Squad" is considered a powerful, avant-garde expression of the futility of human existence by those listeners who have endured the entire work. The artist's first work, "Symphony Number 1 in A Major for Orchestra and Abattoir," was notorious for being recorded in China, where animal cruelty laws are more lax than in the Western World, and for using the dying vocalizations of tortured small animals as a counterpoint to the delicately arranged orchestral portion. The second and final symphony by this composer ups the ante by using the terrified and pained screams of condemned prisoners being executed and tortured to death by trained professionals, accentuated by the use of the handgun, scalpel, and poison gas in rhythmic fashion. The final movement, the "Allegro," is the first piece of classical music to require the execution of its own conductor as, following a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, the composer's own dying spasms provide the final percussion tempo to the slow, dirgelike ending played by a single cello.
**Music Results:** Everything that it says in the liner notes.
**Subject Comments:** //The digital recording loses some nuance. It sounds much better on vinyl.//

------

**Subject:** Dr. D███, Level 4 Security. Subject did not profess his favorite music.
**Artist Profile:** M███ D███ did not invent the fart joke, but he certainly improved on it. Associated with such names as Adam Sandler and Bill Hicks, M███ D███ has been featured on such shows as Saturday Night Live and MadTV for his talents in stand-up and comic song. M███ D███ wrote and directed the 20██ summer flop "[REDACTED] Movie", unanimously rated as the "Worst Movie of All Time".
**Music Results:** Mostly low-brow stand-up and lewd acoustic guitar songs. Most tracks concern typical family problems, bodily functions, sex, and politics. Subject was visibly angry at the results.
**Subject Comments:** //Not funny...//

------

//**Note:** It seems SCP-624 isn't limited to specific genres of music, but the scope of the listener's imagination. --A separate test log may be needed for further testing.-- Again, I am to remind all Site ██ personnel that all access to SCP-624 is strictly for experimental purposes only, and that SCP-624 is not to be played in the Site ██ break room... --for now--...  -Dr. Z████████//

//**Note:** Dr. Z████████, I think you mean, "is not to be played in the Site ██ break room __ever__, and under the penalty of demotion if you do." -Dr. D███, Level 4 Security//

**Subject:** Agent 'Schism' MacCullough
**Artist Profile:** The decidedly eclectic stylings of the Blue Tower Symphonic are difficult to describe succinctly, ranging from techno symphonies to bit-tune pop to grunge opera - and everything in between, oftentimes in the same song.  Debuting with the widely acclaimed ''Here's to you, Gabe'' and moving on to such tour-de-force works as ''Nanamapolu'' and ''Qwerty - The Golden Ages'', they've gone through every genre on the market, and made up quite a few of their own, from the classic Polynesian Bluegrass of "Rumba Hoedown" to the more atmospheric "On The Brink" - and their shows are a hodge-podge of hippies, ravers, goths, and ongoers with opera glasses in tightly-pressed black suits sipping fine martinis.
**Music Results:** Just plain weird.  Schizophrenic, even.  There's no way to really pick out a style, any lyrical aptitude, or oftentimes even a beat.  Tracks seem to blend together into one giant 'concept album' with no real beginning or end, and the use of the digeridooka, theremin, and electric trombone seem to cement the idea that the artists have no clue whether they're coming or going.
**Subject Comments:** //I could listen to this for hours.  Hey, could we figure out a way to record this to a giant MP3 DVD?//

//**Note:** Agent MacCullough, as I have told both Dr. Dr. Z████████, Agent S██████, and Field Researcher ████████, SCP-624 is not to be used for personal enjoyment, but to test the scope of its abilities. Again, testing of SCP-624 should be for **research only**. Any personnel caught listening to SCP-624 for personal reasons will be banned from its use. Any personnel caught recording any audio from SCP-624 will be transferred off-site for temporary field duty. -Dr. D███, Level 4 Security//

**Subject:** Agent E█████. It should be of note that Agent E█████ partook in the original test of SCP-624 and has since gotten into rap music.
**Artist Profile:** East coast and west coast collide, forming E-Dizzle! E-Dizzle is the first rapper to not only tour with Tupac Shakur //and// Biggie Smalls, but united the now-duo for their first tour in 2002. E-Dizzle helped discover and produce for rapper Eminem. Much mystery surrounded E-Dizzle's death in 20██, but his legacy still lives on.
**Music Results:** Music consisted of a strange new form of rap, listed under the genre "Hybrid Coast". Songs were a mix of G-funk and mafioso rap, mixing west coast funk synths and east coast orchestras. Two hundred and eight (208) of the four hundred and six (406) tracks contain guest rappers, most of whom are rivals or dead in this timeline. Subject initially pleased with results, only to learn the date of his death is the same from the previous test.
**Subject Comments:** //"Seriously, if you guys could just let me take this outside and blast this over my car speakers-... Hold on. What year did that artist profile thing say?"// Subject then proceeded to repeatedly scream about the year. Testing ceased shortly after.

**Subject:** Dr. L████████. Subject claims to like orchestral music, but says she prefers audiobooks.
**Artist Profile:** Pulitzer and Nobel Prize winner Hailey L████████ is one of the most prolific novelists of the 21st century, having written forty novel in twenty years: roughly two novels a year. Mrs. L████████ is well-renowned for her fiction writing seminars, drawing students from all over the world. Much controversy surrounds Mrs. L████████'s strange autobiography, released only in audio format. 
**Music Results:** The results were not music, but a chronological list of audiobooks, all read by the subject. The genres of each audiobook don't seem to follow any sort of pattern: the first book, "Seasons of Longing," is a historical romance that slowly gains fantasy/time travel elements as it goes on. The next novel, "Hills of Glory," is a war story that switches to supernatural horror halfway through. The stories of these audiobooks are captivating according to the listening researchers, and continue increasing in quality as they go on, culminating in the second-to-last track, "All This Time," a family epic with supernatural elements. The final track, "UNKNOWNTRACK00000," starts out as a straight-forward autobiography of the writer. The narrator begins by talking about her home life, how she picked up writing, and how she wrote her first novel, but then the narrator begins berating the subject for not making the same choice, growing increasingly angrier and louder. All attempts to turn down the volume do nothing to quiet the narrator's screaming and insults. SCP-624 was disconnected from the speakers, shut off, and testing ceased.
**Subject Comments:** Subject had no official comment. Subject requested temporary leave from the Foundation. The request was denied. Subject requested Class-A Amnesiacs. This request was also denied.
