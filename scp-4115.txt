**Item #:** SCP-4115

**Object Class:** --Euclid-- Neutralized


**NOTE:** The following containment procedures and description are outdated and being saved for posterity.  Refer to Incident-4115-Familiaris-I for further details.

**Special Containment Procedures:** All entrances to SCP-4115 have been blocked from public access through an agreement between the SCP Foundation and the Maryland state government. Any civilians attempting to access SCP-4115 are to be apprehended before they successfully enter SCP-4115 and amnestied before being released back into the general public. Lucifer-grade anti-memetic broadcast pylons are to be installed intermittently above ground and around the perimeter of the cavern, and all guards are to be issued headgear engineered for anti-memetic purposes in order to avoid manipulation by SCP-4115-01. Should SCP-4115-01 ever breach containment, efforts are to be made to properly ascertain the severity of the threat SCP-4115-01 poses before proper action is taken. 

**Description**: SCP-4115 is a show cave titled "███████ ████████", located approximately two (2) miles outside the town of █████████, Maryland. The cavern descends into the earth at a syncline, with tall, narrow passages making up nearly the entirety of the cave. SCP-4115 is primarily composed of various types of clay and stone. Large, opaque crystals resembling quartz line the walls of the cavern. These crystals are remarkably sharp and incapable of being damaged by any known tool or implement. Direct contact between any living being and the crystal causes both the crystal and the being to dissolve[[footnote]] Similar to flesh being dissolved by hydrochloric acid.[[/footnote]]. The density of the crystal clusters increases as SCP-4115 goes further underground, eventually reaching a point where the entirety of the cavern is covered by crystal. A large crystal wall, measuring five (5) meters by seven (7) meters, is located at the bottom-most point of the cavern, past the deepest point used in official tours by ███████ ████████. The wall appears to be heavily damaged, with a large indentation present in its center.  

SCP-4115 is host to an entity referred to as SCP-4115-01. SCP-4115-01 is thought to be located behind the crystal wall at the bottom of SCP-4115. SCP-4115-01 has explicit power over the happenings within SCP-4115, including knowledge of the exact locations of individuals within the cavern, and the ability to manipulate the cavern itself and the features within it[[footnote]] SCP-4115-01 has demonstrated that it is capable of closing cavern walls rapidly and warping features of the cavern at will.[[/footnote]], but seems to be unable to affect the crystals that line the cavern. SCP-4115-01 has also exhibited the ability to telepathically communicate with and manipulate human beings who enter the cavern. This telepathic ability is somewhat limited and is capable of being hindered by basic anti-memetic agents or heavy metals. Subjects under SCP-4115-01's manipulation share several common traits, including:

* Heightened levels of stress.
* Overclocked adrenaline production.
* Movement and coordination problems.
* Lack of a self-preservation instinct. 

If left unrestrained, affected subjects will attempt to reach the lowest point of the cavern. and use their body to dissolve the crystal wall. Any attempt to stop or restrain subjects under SCP-4115-01's control generally creates a negative response from SCP-4115-01, which will use SCP-4115's interior against perceived threats to the subject. To date, no subject under SCP-4115-01's control has succeeded in completely melting through the crystal wall.

--Due to the abilities of SCP-4115-01 and the uncertainty of its intentions, current containment procedures focus on ensuring that SCP-4115-01 does not escape from SCP-4115. While not much is understood about SCP-4115-01 or its intentions, it has been determined that the crystal wall is likely the only barrier preventing its escape, and it is unable to destroy the wall itself. Repair of the crystal wall from previously sustained damage has proved unsuccessful, so attention is currently focused on preventing SCP-4115-01 from manipulating more subjects.-- See Incident-4115-Familiaris-I.

On 14/6/████, Containment Specialist █████, who had been overseeing SCP-4115's containment site, opened fire on guards posted around SCP-4115 and entered the cavern with a large precession of approximately two (2) dozen D-Class personnel. Based on information gathered post incident, Specialist █████ had been exposed to SCP-4115-01's manipulative properties at some unknown point prior and had manipulated the D-Class subjects to follow him under the guise of an escape attempt[[footnote]] Review of the footage confirms that the D-Class were put under SCP-4115's influence as well, likely when they initially entered the cavern after Specialist █████.[[/footnote]]. A security team of seven (7) were dispatched to retrieve Specialist █████ and execute the D-Class Personnel before they could reach the crystal wall. Below is a transcript of the video footage recovered from Operative Davis, a staff sergeant from the security team sent into SCP-4115. 

> **00:00:** Footage begins. Operative Davis, along with the rest of the security team, are seen sprinting past the entrance into SCP-4115. Specialist █████ and the D-Class personnel are ahead of them at this point.

> **01:27:** Security team is attempting to move through the cavern as quickly as possible. A D-Class appears ahead of the team, lagging behind the rest of the group. Operative Davis opens fire on the D-Class and executes him. The team runs past the corpse and continues into the cavern.

> **03:02:** A scream is heard from within the cavern, followed by a loud thud. The cavern wall to the left of the team suddenly slides forward and crushes 3 of the team members against the opposite wall. A team member is heard cursing while the leader of the group urges them to continue.

> **04:24:** The team arrives at a large vertical tunnel inside the cavern, where two (2) D-Class personnel are seen attempting to descend into the tunnel by scaling its walls before being swiftly executed. Operative Davis pans downward and captures a brief shot of Specialist █████ and the remaining D-Class personnel sprinting into the passage at the bottom of the tunnel, which is more heavily encompassed by crystal than earlier sections of the cavern. The security team begins a hasty descent after them.

> **05:31:** Operative Davis is seen descending the cavern with his hands. To his right are the two other team members and the team leader. A groaning noise is heard before a large stalactite is seen falling on one of the team members' head, killing them instantaneously and sending their body to the bottom of the tunnel. Operative Davis and the other team members begin descending more rapidly. Upon reaching the bottom of the tunnel, another groaning noise is heard, and the tunnel can be seen contracting around the remaining team members. Operative Davis and the team leader manage to get into the passage at the bottom of the tunnel before it fully contracts, while the other team member is seen slipping into a small crevice in the side of the wall before the tunnel crushes them. 

> **06:16:** Operative Davis and the team leader continue down the passageway, which is completely enveloped by crystal at this point in the cavern. They eventually reach the exits, which leads to the chamber containing the crystal wall. Specialist █████ is seen directing the D-Class personnel into the wall, gradually wearing it down. Operative Davis and the team leader open fire on the small group, at which point Specialist █████ shoves multiple D-Class onto the wall, followed by himself. Operative Davis unsuccessfully attempts to pull Specialist █████ and the D-Class personnel off of the wall before they melt. Cracks start appearing in the crystal and the wall starts to radiate light. Team leader grabs Operative Davis by the shoulder and orders him to retreat. Turning to face the passage, a large detonation from behind sends chunks of crystal fling around the chamber. Operative Davis and the team leader are knocked back by the blast. Operative Davis recovers and turns to face the source of the detonation. The wall has been completely destroyed, and a small canine, appearing to belong to the Polish Lowland sheepdog breed, is seen where the wall once stood. This is presumed to be SCP-4115-01. The dog's fur is heavily discolored and caked with clay, though the dog itself appears to be fine, at least externally. Without warning, the dog suddenly sprints past Operative Davis and up into the passageway. Operative Davis attempts to pursue SCP-4115-01 but loses track of it at the entrance to the tunnel, which has fully reopened. The team member previously trapped in the tunnel is seen waiting at its bottom and exclaims to Operator Davis that they saw SCP-4115-01 rapidly ascend the tunnel in a manner deemed impossible for a regular dog. Both team members return down the passage to meet up with the team leader.

Following the incident, the crystals lining SCP-4115 gradually began to dissipate, leaving the entire cavern devoid of their presence. No anomalous activity has been recorded within or around SCP-4115 after this event. Recordings of the entrance to the cavern during the incident do not show SCP-4115-01 escaping off-site, and its whereabouts are currently unknown. SCP-4115 has been reclassified as Neutralized for the time being. Efforts are being made to gradually re-open the cavern to the public, with its long period of closure being covered as repairs to the structural integrity of the tunnels. Observation of the area around SCP-4115 for any sign of SCP-4115-01 is ongoing.
