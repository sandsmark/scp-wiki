Although, it doesn’t seem like Doctor North is able to do that much. Being at the Foundation with first-hand knowledge in espionage and logistics landed Doctor North in the sights of the Intelligence Agency.[[footnote]]Not to be confused with [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/task-forces#delta-5| Delta-5 “Front Runners”]]][[/footnote]]

Doctor North worked within the Intelligence Agency as a field agent often infiltrating important GoIs locations as a double agent. Known alias: Ariwa, Norden, Veri, Norte, Şimol, Nord, Leboea.

----
**History:** A master of technological information and chemistry. Doctor North spent much of his time researching chemical agents for the United States Military after getting accepted to study abroad in America from Germany. Doctor North is certified with a Ph.D. Chemical Engineering, as well as Information Technology. 

Doctor North became a person of interest to the Foundation after he was expelled from Michigan Technological University while studying to get a Ph.D. certification in physics. Doctor North was expelled after he was indicted for espionage of University’s research. Doctor North was formally charged. Although, there never enough evidence to follow through with a trial. Doctor North signed in with the Foundation with the promise of getting his name cleared, as well as his student debt paid for.
