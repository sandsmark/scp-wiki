title:Rules of Thumb
This page is where I'm going to start collecting some of the little observations by staff and users on various aspects of the wiki. Feel free to add to it if you have good ones. Keep in mind that these are just rules of thumb, not site rules, and that breaking them won't get you punished, but will more likely than not get you mocked. ~yoric
-----------------------------------------------------------

* //Gears' Razor//: When in doubt, the scarier option is probably correct.

* //Yoric's Constant//: As the quality of a new submission decreases, the likelihood of a crosslink to able, 682, or telekill approaches one.

* //Principle of geometric mediocrity//: SCP articles wherein the SCP is something shaped like something tend to suck.

* //Rule Number One//: Mann has a better mustache than you. No, shut up, he does.

* //Rule Number Two//: Rule number one is always whatever you need it to be given the circumstances at hand. That said, Mann will always have the superior mustache.

* //Rule Number One//: Snorlison's was better.

* //The Bright Principle//: If you carefully choose your words for tact, it's possible whoever you're talking to will get the message. If you're as blunt as possible, it's //certain//.

* //Rule of Emotional Torque//: A good article forces an emotional reaction, be it fright, curiosity, longing, pity, or rage. Simply being dangerous or incomprehensible isn't enough; it has to make the reader react, as well.

* //Needs A Name Observation//: Just because it's threatening doesn't make it frightening. Danger alone will not carry an article.

* //The Fundamental Base of the Unsaid//: Redacting and Expunging are not used for fear. They're used to hide knowledge. The fear created is the possibility, implication, or terror of what might be there.  Because essentially, the imagination of the person reading the article is the one filling in the gap, and they can always frighten themselves better than you can.

* //The Sabitsuki Conundrum//: If you spend long enough on the site, articles which you least expect to succeed will begin to be higher rated than what you consider your better work. This is because new users have no standards.

* //King's Constant//: Apple seeds.

* //Troy's General Suggestion//: There can be no happiest endings.  There can be bad endings, good endings, even happy endings, but never a happiest ending.  That's not a story; it's a fairy tale. Taint the good with a touch of suffering, and you'll get the effect you want.

* //Sal's Advisory//: If everyone in the chat tells you not to post something, you probably shouldn't post it.

* //Rule Number One//: If you pretend you've read the guide materials and haven't actually done so, we //will// be able to tell, and you //will// look stupid.
