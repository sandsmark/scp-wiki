title:Rules of Thumb
This page is where I'm going to start collecting some of the little observations by staff and users on various aspects of the wiki. Feel free to add to it if you have good ones. ~yoric
-----------------------------------------------------------

* //Gears' Razor//: When in doubt, the scarier option is probably correct.

* //Yoric's Constant//: As the quality of a new submission decreases, the likelihood of a crosslink to able, 682, or telekill approaches one.

* //Principle of geometric mediocrity//: SCP articles wherein the SCP is something shaped like something tend to suck.

* //The Sabitsuki Conundrum//: If you spend long enough on the site, articles which you least expect to succeed will begin to be higher rated than what you consider your better work. This is because new users have no standards.

* //The Bright Principle//: If you carefullly choose your words for tact, it's possible whoever you're talking to will get the message. If you're as blunt as possible, it's //certain//.
