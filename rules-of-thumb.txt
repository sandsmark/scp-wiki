title:Rules of Thumb
This page is where I'm going to start collecting some of the little observations by staff and users on various aspects of the wiki. Feel free to add to it if you have good ones. Keep in mind that these are just rules of thumb, not site rules, and that breaking them won't get you punished, but will more likely than not get you mocked. ~yoric
-----------------------------------------------------------

* //Gears' Razor//: When in doubt, the scarier option is probably correct.

* //Yoric's Relation//: As the quality of a new submission decreases, the likelihood of a crosslink to Able, 682, or Telekill approaches one.

* //Principle of Geometric Mediocrity//: SCP articles wherein the SCP is something shaped like something tend to suck.

* //Rule Number One//: Mann has a better mustache than you. No, shut up, he does.

* //Rule Number Two//: Rule number one is always whatever you need it to be given the circumstances at hand. That said, Mann will always have the superior mustache.

* //Rule Number One//: Snorlison's was better.

* //The Bright Principle//: If you carefully choose your words for tact, it's possible whoever you're talking to will get the message. If you're as blunt as possible, it's //certain//.

* //Rule of Emotional Torque//: A good article forces an emotional reaction, be it fright, curiosity, longing, pity, or rage. Simply being dangerous or incomprehensible isn't enough; it has to make the reader react, as well.

* //Alten's Observation//: Just because it's threatening doesn't make it frightening. Danger alone will not carry an article.

* //The Fundamental Base of the Unsaid//: Redacting and Expunging are not used for fear. They're used to hide knowledge. The fear created is the possibility, implication, or terror of what might be there.  Because essentially, the imagination of the person reading the article is the one filling in the gap, and they can always frighten themselves better than you can.

* //The Sabitsuki Conundrum//: If you spend long enough on the site, articles which you least expect to succeed will begin to be higher rated than what you consider your better work. This is because new users have no standards.

* //King's Constant//: Apple seeds.

* //Troy's General Suggestion//: There can be no happiest endings.  There can be bad endings, good endings, even happy endings, but never a happiest ending.  That's not a story; it's a fairy tale. Taint the good with a touch of suffering, and you'll get the effect you want.

* //Sal's Advisory//: If everyone in the chat tells you not to post something, you probably shouldn't post it.

* //Sorts' Law//: Memetic effect + Crazy to death = Failure.

* //Rule Number One//: If you pretend you've read the guide materials and haven't actually done so, we //will// be able to tell, and you //will// look stupid.

* //Rule of Lists//: If somebody tells you that your draft is bad, and they point you toward a list of rules instead of telling you exactly why it's bad, it's likely not all that bad.

* //First Rule of Lists//: If somebody tells you that your draft is bad, when  they point you toward a list of rules and tell you exactly which points are causing it problems, it's not bad, it's likely far worse.

* //Second Rule of Lists//: That doesn't mean that people won't downvote it just for that reason.

* //Quik's Advice//: From the days when applicants to the wiki had to come get advice from a chat op...
 # You cannot please everyone all the time.
 # Keep a thick skin-- people around here are brutally honest.
 # When in doubt, lurk more.
 # You cannot be certain what people will really like-- or really hate.
 # Don't pour your heart and soul into an SCP before it's posted-- wait until you know it's going to stick.

* //The First Rule About Foundation Tales//: No one reads Foundation Tales. Well. Many users choose to read Foundation tales without ever voting on them, which is annoying. Expect a Tale's rise to popularity to come very... very... slowly...

* //The Second Rule About Foundation Tales//: A tale that is funny, or does something cool, is more likely to be upvoted than one that is creepy or in tone with the site. Which is one of the reasons we have Foundation tales.

* //The Third Rule About Foundation Tales//: Don't expect something to get changed over your tale.  No one should be expected to update their author profile, article they wrote, or one of their tales for the sake of your story.

* //Brevity Clause//: Write the article. Sum it up with a tl;dr. Post the tl;dr.

* //Law of Authorial Insight//: Redaction is not a substitute for coming up with something interesting. The author should always know exactly what's been "removed" from the article.

* //Gears' Axiom//: If you look at your new SCP, and don't feel a little uneasy about your own mental state, or worry that others might think you're starting to get unhinged, it probably needs a bit more work.

* //Excessive Danger Rule//: Making something more dangerous does not necessarily make it creepier or more interesting.  Neither does increasing its threat classification - Keter is not automatically better than Euclid or Safe.  Thus, tacking on extra dangerousness (see Sorts' Law above for a couple of common examples) is a waste of time and will probably lower the quality of the article.

* //The First Rule About Pictures//: Your SCP will probably be better with a picture.  

* //The Second Rule About Pictures//: The more text you need to describe what you're visualizing, the more your article needs a picture.

* //The Third Rule About Pictures//: No matter how "totally awesome" and "fucking badass" that drawing is, scrap it. The only artist's impression you're going to get is the bootprint on your article when people downvote it.
 
* //Scantron's Rule of Thumb//: Your article should be longer than your thumb.

* //Tuomey's Relation//: As the amount of articles a person has read approaches zero, the percentage chance they are doing it wrong approaches 100.

* //Real Life Rule//: If a real live thing is made into an SCP, the SCP article must be at least as interesting as that real live thing.

* //An SCP Never Walks Into A Bar Rule//: There should be a believable reason why your SCP drew the attention of the Foundation.

* //Rule of Criticism//: Everyone has one vote, but some comments are worth more than others.
