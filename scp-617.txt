**Item #:** SCP-617

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:**

SCP-617 is to be kept in a soundproof container at all times. When in storage, SCP-617 must be kept in its soundproof containment cell and its "mouth" kept zipped at all times except for experiments. All personnel entering SCP-617's containment area must wear hearing protection devices as a precautionary measure. SCP-617 cannot be taken from its containment cell without approval from a level 4 researcher, and must always be kept within its secure container when being moved.

In the event of a containment breach, SCP-617 must be retrieved by personnel with proper hearing protection. The entire sector must be locked down and all personnel thoroughly searched until SCP-617 is contained. 

**Description:**

SCP-617 has the appearance of a standard rock, except that it possesses a zipper in its side that is fully operational. When unzipped, SCP-617 is shown to possess a mouth with teeth that appear similar in appearance and construction with human teeth. X-Ray and MRI scans of SCP-617 appear to be unable to penetrate its stone exterior. Similar tests to try and probe SCP-617's internal systems have likewise proven inconclusive. SCP-617's mouth is fully functional, and can vocalize sounds as well as be used to consume food. SCP-617 is also capable of limited movement, being able to roll around on its own.

However, SCP-617's most disturbing aspect is its parasitical tendencies as well as its ability to influence human behavior. In addition to being able to speak, SCP-617 can generate a low frequency sound that allows it to exert subliminal control over any human that hears it. Humans affected by SCP-617 will become emotionally attached to it, similar to that of a pet and will actively care for it to the best of their ability. As long as they are affected by SCP-617, victims will put SCP-617's care as a priority, giving it a home, protecting it from danger, and most importantly, making sure it is well fed.

SCP-617 has an active digestive system, and sustains itself on a diet primarily consisting of fresh meat. Since it is unable to obtain food on its own, SCP-617 persuades its owner to gather food.  The owner will then resort to any means to feed SCP-617. Recorded instances have shown that owners are willing to slaughter livestock and other pets to feed SCP-617, and will even resort to murder other human beings. In times of desperation, it is not uncommon for the owner to feed parts of themselves to SCP-617. On some occassions, SCP-617 will actually begin to devour its owner while he is asleep. The owner will either not notice this or not care, and will continue caring for SCP-617. However, once the owner is separated from the low frequency sound SCP-617 produces, he will eventually begin to recover from its effects, though he is still vulnerable to relapse if exposed to SCP-617 again.

Further research has shown that zipping up SCP-617 completely neutralizes its ability to produce any sound. However, it still requires feeding and is still capable of limited movement, being able to slowly roll itself along even ground. SCP-617 is also sapient, possessing average intelligence and capable of human speech. However, in all attempts to communicate, SCP-617 is incapable or unwilling to discuss anything further than basic conversation. It will, however, state its desire to feed and attempt to persuade any individuals within earshot to care for it. As such, a standard IQ test is impossible to carry out.

The Foundation was made aware of SCP-617's existence after a series of mysterious serial murders began exhibiting a strange pattern where all of the victims where partially devoured. The Foundation involved itself in the investigation and managed to track the suspect, █████████ ██████ to his home. During the operation (see After Action Report 617), SCP-617's persuasive powers were discovered and it was successfully contained.

**After Action Report 617**: 

Agent ████ was sent to apprehend █████████ ██████ for possible SCP possession. However, all contact was lost. A Foundation armed response team was sent to investigate. However, Agent ████ had become hostile and initiated a confrontation with Delta Team. Both Agent ████ and █████████ ██████ were killed in the ensuing gunfight, with Delta Team suffering three wounded. At this point, a psychic or memetic factor was suspected and Delta team was ordered to stay back and form a defensive perimeter. Remote probing of the area revealed an anomalous, low freqency sound being generated. D-Class personnel with hearing protection were able to recover SCP-617 and successfully contain it. 

Forensic analysis of █████████ ██████'s home revealed that he had been in possession of SCP-617 for at least six months. During that period, he had systematically fed his entire collection of pets to SCP-617, slowly cutting them apart while they were still alive. When he had run out of pets, █████████ ██████ moved on to humans, starting the string of serial murders that were intially investigated. An autopsy revealed a number of human bite marks on his body, with two fingers, six toes, and roughly six ounces of flesh missing. Dental analysis showed that the bite marks were a perfect match for the SCP-617's teeth. Autopsies of the murder victims corroborated SCP-617's capabilities.

At this time, it is unknown how long SCP-617 has existed or whether there are more instances of it. There must be an expanded emphasis on analyzing serial murder cases that involve cannibalization of corpses, as well as similar sociopathic behaviors.

**Addendum 1:** Since the acquistion of SCP-617, two more instances of it were discovered and contained. The Foundation now has SCP-617-1, SCP-617-2, and SCP-617-3 in containment. All three SCPs have been put in the same cell in order to observe patterns such as reproduction, communication, and competition.

**Experiment Log:** 

Experiment 1
Subject: D-487, two dogs, one cat, one bird.
Result: D-487 systematically mutilated each pet one by one and fed the flesh to SCP-617. The moment one pet expired, D-487 immediately moved on to the next pet.

Experiment 2
Subject: D-980 and D-458
Result: D-980 was immediately affected while D-458, who was wearing hearing protection for the experiment, showed no signs of change. D-980 immedieately attacked D-458, subdued her, and allowed SCP-617 to begin feeding on D-458. The process continued for two hours until D-458 expired from blood loss and shock. SCP-617 ceased feeding once D-458 expired.

Experiment 3
Subject: D-684
Result: D-684 was sedated for the entire experiment. During observation, SCP-617 slowly moved up to D-684 and began slowly devour parts of his body. However, SCP-617 stopped after only twenty minutes. D-684 was allowed to awaken and seemed to show no concern that he was missing his left eyelid, his nose, and three fingers on his left hand. 

Experiment 4
Subject: D-852
Result: D-852 began searching the cell for anything to feed SCP-617. She then began pleading to the research staff to give her food to feed SCP-617. When denied, D-852 began cutting pieces of her flesh off to feed SCP-617. The process continued until D-852 expired from blood loss.

Experiment 5
Subject: [DATA EXPUNGED]
Result: [DATA EXPUNGED]

**Administrative Note**
//In light of recent events, all testing with SCP-617 is restricted to human test subjects and non-sapient lifeforms only.// -O5-█
