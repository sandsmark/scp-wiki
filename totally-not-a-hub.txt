//In the end, the only thing you leave behind in this world is your name. And what happens when that gets taken from you?// ~Some guy.

Mark really screwed the pooch this time, and now Paul is paying the price. Their rent is nearly due and they no longer have the money to pay for that and their basic amenities. Luckily, Mark has a plan, a very stupid, long and awfully **dark** plan that tempts with forces well beyond what two anartists are capable of handling themselves. Paul on the other hand, just wants to keep the apartment. It's nice, and it's got a jacuzzi bathtub. But something is amiss, and Paul can barely see it.

At the Foundation, Dr. Alaina Chin is struggling with her familial bonds. Her brother, Ethan, is being investigated and will likely become an SCP despite her protests. Her sister Gytha works for the power-hungry, money-sucking elite, and her other sister Emilie recently started working for the Serpent's Hand. Something is amiss, and none of them can see it.

Meanwhile, Gytha Chin lost a promotion she more than deserved to someone significantly less qualified than her, and she is reasonably upset. After receiving orders from Mr. Marshall himself, she embarks on a journey to rid the world of two thieving anartists with extreme prejudice. Something is amiss, but she is too distracted to notice.

A vile perversion of nature sits just beneath everyone's feet staring up at them, waiting for its chance to seep into the world and enshroud it in its mass. **The Void** is lurking in every shadow, in every breath they take, in every crack in the ground. It will strike them all down one by one until there is nothing left. But how can they deal with a threat that no one knows is there?

Somewhere in the world, in the unchecked shadows of an old factory, someone is performing a ritual, and **The Void** sits patiently beneath them, waiting for its chance to surface. It was always there. A silent observer to every action that was made on the surface. It is leaking now and has been for quite a while. The creatures that fester within it have once again grown restless as more and more people exploit **The Void** for their own benefit. You know some of them as anomalies, anartists, or reality benders. 

Your names mean nothing. The ritual is almost complete.
