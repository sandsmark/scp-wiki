This is just a quick author page for myself, in which I pimp myself and share a few dumb jokes. 

__**Silly bits**__

In my SCPs, I use the titular character of Pangloss. Chat had yielded a laugh or two about the guy.

[[collapsible show="Pangloss" hide="Paaaaaaaaaanny :O"]]
> Sometimes hate is just another way of love.
> //-Pangloss//

> Sometimes, life is butts. But butts are //beautiful//.
> //-Pangloss//

> A shirt that's on fire keeps you warm.
> //-Pangloss//

> Thank god it's Friday.
> //-Pangloss//

> REPLACE PAPER IN PRINTER! OTHER PEOPLE USE THIS THING TOO! -THX
> //-Pangloss//

> CLEAN THE MICROWAVE AFTER YOU USE IT, YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE
> //-Pangloss//

> ███-███-████ hit me up 4 sum hot bathroom action xoxo
> //-Pangloss//

On ██/██/████, the following note was found in SCP-231-7's containment chamber:
> Sometimes it is easy to have a //whale// of a time.
> //-Pangloss//
