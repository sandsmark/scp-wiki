title:Dr Jon Drake's Personnel File
**Name:** "Dr." Jon Drake

**Security Clearance:** Level 3

**Background:** Unknown

**Nationality:** Unknown, though presumed British

**Qualifications:** None documented, though demonstrates doctorate level ability in the fields of BioPhysics, Applied Mathematics and Organic Chemistry

**History:** Unknown prior to ██-██-████. One of the few survivors of the event which [Data Expunged] together with the destruction of the entire facility. Fully establishing what occurred is further complicated by the amnesia suffered by all survivors. It has been confirmed that the being then designated as SCP-███ was neutralized, and speculated that the removal of all personal memories or documentation of the surviving team was probably its final dying act of revenge against its executioners.

Drake and the other survivors were designated as "John Doe's" and held for questioning. While impossible to establish their identity it was possible to confirm the survivor as Foundation staff thanks to [Data Expunged]. After intensive testing and interrogation it was established that none of the survivors suffered any lasting effects other than the amnesia and were classified safe. Most were subsequently terminated as security concerns. Drake only avoided the same fate due to the intervention of ██████████.

Although Drake harbors resentment against the Foundation for his treatment under interrogation, his situation prevents him from finding other work. The Foundation in turn keeps Drake under close observation in case he develops any further abnormalities from the event, but feel he is a valuable enough asset to continue his employment at present.

"Dr." Jon Drake took his new name from that of the British explorer. Although he was found [Data Expunged] after the events at [Data Expunged] his accent would suggest an upbringing in England. Though Drake does not possess any documented qualifications, he insists on being addressed as "Dr.", arguing that just because he can't remember or prove his credentials "that doesn't mean he doesn't deserve a little damn respect." Staff are encouraged to humor him, as he is liable to engage in juvenile reprisals against those he feels have disrespected him. Drake is currently working towards a doctorate in Psychology in order to formalize his honorific.

**Item #:** SCP-XXX

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:**
Object the be kept in 4m x 4m x 4m containment chamber of 0.5m thick titanium. Chamber must be surrounded on all sides by 20m or more of inert metal or rock. Chamber must be located no less than 100m from any other containment chamber, access passageway (excepting direct access to SCP-XXX), moving machinery or geological feature.

All items must be approved before introduction to containment chamber. Firearms are forbidden within chamber. Chamber to be vacuum sealed when experimentation is not in progress. Compression and decompression must be conducted at no more than 5 liters per minute. Failure to comply may result in containment breach. Total energy content of chamber must be kept as low as possible, including kinetic. All personnel are required to keep movement within chamber to a minimum, except as part of approved test procedures.

**Description:**
SCP-XXX varies in appearance and physical properties. Its size has been observed to range from 5cm to 2.3m, its mass from 11g to 1100kg. When first retrieved SCP-XXX took the form of a bronze statuette; since then it has taken a number of forms and currently appears as a puddle of liquid metal. It has at many times taken on the appearance of a metallic structure of complex design, fundamentally similar but every design distinct from each other.

SCP-XXX is capable of "stealing" physical forms or attributes from its surrounding. Whatever property SCP-XXX steals is permanently removed from the target and temporarily assumed by SCP-XXX for a varying duration. When SCP-XXX steals an objects form the target is reduced to a featureless assemblage of its original matter. Experimental evidence suggests that SCP-XXX's range of influence is slightly less than 20m. This ability is used unpredictably and seemingly at random, except for [DATA EXPUNGED].

SCP-XXX is incapable of movement, except by stealing momentum from its surroundings. Even when assuming the form of a moving object, it only inherits the same quantity of energy that it removes from the target. SCP-XXX has thus far only been able to source kinetic and chemical energy, though the possibility of it sourcing nuclear energy in the future has not been discounted and poses a serious threat to containment.

SCP-XXX does not appear actively hostile towards staff and other biological organisms. However it is capable of inflicting serious damage to anything within its range of influence, which is typically fatal. It is speculated that this is a secondary effect of its attempt to explore its environment rather than its primary intent. SCP-XXX has continuously and methodically attempted to breach containment; while its behavior is indicative of instinct and reaction rather than intelligence, the incident where [DATA EXPUNGED] demonstrating a potential for sentience and planning [DATA EXPUNGED] which resulted in the objects upgrading to Keter class.

**Addendum A - Partial Log:**
The complete log may be found in the accompanying files.

* Temperature of SCP-XXX increases to several hundred degrees (exact figure unknown) while surrounding area is flash frozen.
* SCP-XXX becomes totally opaque to large frequency range of electromagnetic spectrum. Spherical volume around SCP-XXX rendered transparent, including containment chamber, surrounding rock and 1/3rd assigned research staff.
* SCP-XXX exudes liquid for 20 seconds. D-class personnel engaged in experimental procedure completely dessicated.
* SCP-XXX takes on a reflective surface and begins to glow brightly from within. Entire contents of chamber rendered non-reflective, currently under study as potential stealth material.
* Containment breach in sector prompts a rapid evacuation. Fleeing staff suddenly frozen while SCP-XXX accelerates to sufficient speed to breach primary containment. Containment procedures updated.
* Experimental team suddenly collapse. After-incident autopsy shows that large sections of internal structure including the cranium were rendered featureless. Surface of SCP-XXX takes on complex network appearance. SCP-XXX then [DATA EXPUNGED] numerous casualties [DATA EXPUNGED] rapid and intelligent use of its abilities [DATA EXPUNGED] its mission [DATA EXPUNGED] those who sent it. This may [DATA EXPUNGED] though at this stage little can be done to guard against any future appearance. SCP-XXX then became inert and was safely returned to the containment chamber.
