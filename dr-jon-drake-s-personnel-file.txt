title:Dr Jon Drake's Personnel File
**Name:** "Dr." Jon Drake

**Security Clearance:** Level 3

**Background:** Unknown

**Nationality:** Unknown, though presumed British

**Qualifications:** None documented, though demonstrates doctorate level ability in the fields of BioPhysics, Applied Mathematics and Organic Chemistry

**History:** Unknown prior to ██-██-████. One of the few survivors of the event which [Data Expunged] together with the destruction of the entire facility. Fully establishing what occurred is further complicated by the amnesia suffered by all survivors. It has been confirmed that the being then designated as SCP-███ was neutralized, and speculated that the removal of all personal memories or documentation of the surviving team was probably its final dying act of revenge against its executioners.

Drake and the other survivors were designated as "John Doe's" and held for questioning. While impossible to establish their identity it was possible to confirm the survivor as Foundation staff thanks to [Data Expunged]. After intensive testing and interrogation it was established that none of the survivors suffered any lasting effects other than the amnesia and were classified safe. Most were subsequently terminated as security concerns. Drake only avoided the same fate due to the intervention of ██████████.

Although Drake harbors resentment against the Foundation for his treatment under interrogation, his situation prevents him from finding other work. The Foundation in turn keeps Drake under close observation in case he develops any further abnormalities from the event, but feel he is a valuable enough asset to continue his employment at present.

"Dr." Jon Drake took his new name from that of the British explorer. Although he was found [Data Expunged] after the events at [Data Expunged] his accent would suggest an upbringing in England. Though Drake does not possess any documented qualifications, he insists on being addressed as "Dr.", arguing that just because he can't remember or prove his credentials "that doesn't mean he doesn't deserve a little damn respect." Staff are encouraged to humor him, as he is liable to engage in juvenile reprisals against those he feels have disrespected him. Drake is currently working towards a doctorate in Psychology in order to formalize his honorific.

**Item #:** SCP-XXX

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:**
At least two foundation members must be present for any interaction with SCP-XXX. One member must be designated Monitor and remain at least 6 feet from SCP-XXX at all times. If accidental application occurs, the Monitor should notify the security team. The Monitor MUST NOT attempt removal of SCP-XXX without supervision.

It is recommended that test subjects should not have SCP-XXX applied for more than 180 minutes. Any experiment involving longer application must have security team present for removal, as test subject may behave unpredictably.

SCP-XXX is a standard sized helmet of ancient design. Attempts to date the helmet are inconclusive, but its design would suggest that it is significantly older than the degree of wear would indicate. Either unusual durability is an additional property or SCP-XXX has been well cared for. This is entirely probable, as it was liberated from [Data Expunged] despite frequent use [Data Expunged] how long the group had been in possession of SCP-XXX, as the only surviving members were not present when [Data Expunged] and has itself been designated SCP-███. Efforts are still in place to track down anyone else involved in the incident.

SCP-XXX has the property of inducing visions in any who wear it. Testing indicates that SCP-XXX does not need to be worn on the head, but that insertion of any part of the body within the volume enclosed by the helmet will count as application. Upon application, the subject will be unable to move any part of their body below the neck until SCP-XXX is removed. During application the subject will be unable to see, feel or otherwise sense their surroundings, with the exception of sounds which the subject will hear as muted and distant. The subject will also experience highly convincing visual, auditory, olfactory, gustative, tactile and nociceptive hallucinations. The form and nature of the hallucination varies depending on subject. The only common element is the disturbing and unpleasant nature of the hallucinations, focusing on the subjects phobias and neuroses. 

**Addendum A:**

The subject is invariably highly motivated to be removed from SCP-XXX, and will go to great lengths to avoid repeat application. When SCP-XXX is removed, the subject remains physically unharmed, although depending on the duration and nature of the exposure may suffer from PTSD or mental breakdown. Prolonged exposure frequently results in total mental breakdown and insanity.


**Experimental Log:**

Please include subject ID and any pertinent biographical or psychological information as well as test results. All tests are of a duration of 30 minutes unless otherwise stated.

All subjects whose psychological profile indicates distinctive paranoias, phobias or neuroses are earmarked as potential SCP-XXX subjects. 

**Date:**
**Subject:**
**Info:**
**Results:**
**Additional Comments:**

**Date:** ██-██-20██
**Subject:** D14729
**Info:** First test subject
**Results:** Subject reported an initial period of blackness before vision returned. Subject responded to questions although complained that it was difficult to hear. After 10 seconds subject began screaming and demanded to be released. When questioned his only response was "They're cutting me, they're cutting me, get me out." When informed that he would remain until the question was answered, subject hurriedly described the hooded figured who were slowly dismembering him. Further detail of the vision was provided after the experiment.
**Additional Comments:** The effect of SCP-XXX is much as expected from reports provided by [Data Expunged] though this currently remains a theory.

**Date:** ██-██-20██
**Subject:** D14783
**Info:** Profile indicates subject had a near death experience after falling into a frozen lake as a child. 
**Results:** Subject described being trapped in a small room slowly filling up with water. After 10 minutes subject became unresponsive to questioning. Technicians discussed removing SCP-XXX when subject resumed speaking, describing the room now filling with icy cold water. Process was repeated with foul and polluted water. Each time subject grew more agitated. Process repeated with blood and then liquid excrement. After 317 minutes subject no longer responded to questioning. SCP-XXX was removed. Subject remained unresponsive and was terminated after 7 day observation period.
**Additional Comments:** The escalating pattern is clear, as is the focus on the subjects personal phobias. If SCP-XXX is to be used for information gathering or other cases where the health of the subject is an issue, extended exposure must be used with care.

**Date:** ██-██-20██
**Subject:** D14791
**Info:** Profile indicates subject suffers from arachnophobia.
**Results:** Unexpectedly, subject experienced a vision of being sexually assaulted by several former cellmates. Subsequent investigation revealed that such an attack occurred during a previous incarceration. SCP-XXX was removed for 10 minutes and then the subject was informed that it would be reapplied. Subject answered intimate questions and followed demeaning instructions in a frantic attempt to prevent reapplication. Reapplication resulted in a similar vision, except all participants were now covered in spiders. After removal, subject damaged restraints in his attempt to escape and was sedated.
**Additional Comments:** Containment facility outfitted with stronger restraints.

**Date:** ██-██-20██
**Subject:** Experimental animal CAN16925
**Info:**  Adult Canine
**Results:** SCP-XXX applied for 90 seconds. Subject displays considerable discomfort, and cowers from SCP-XXX after removal. When restrained and approached with SCP-XXX subject became highly aggressive. Subject was later terminated without further experimentation.
**Additional Comments:** This confirms that SCP-XXX is also effective on non-humans. Request submitted for talking bird or signing ape for further experimentation.

**Date:** ██-██-20██
**Subject:** Technician ████ and Security Personnel ██████ 
**Info:** Accidental application.
**Results:** The circumstances of application are unknown, but both subject were discovered holding SCP-XXX with their fingers just inside the rim. Their positions suggest that ████ was first to be exposed and that ██████ was exposed in his attempt to remove SCP-XXX from him. It is estimated that subjects were exposed for 9 hours before discovery. Both were unresponsive.
**Additional Comments:** Containment procedures updated to prevent a similar incident occurring. it is that in subsequent experimentation that SCP-XXX be applied to some other appendage rather than the head so that facial expressions of subjects may also be monitored.

**Date:** ██-██-20██
**Subject:** D14827
**Info:** Subject sentenced for 4 counts of homicide, the earliest being his father whom it is suspected was abusive. Subject has two younger sisters towards which he is fiercely protective. (See history of violent incidents with other inmates resulting from insults against his family.)
**Results:** It was predicted that the subject would likely relive an incident of abuse against himself of his family by his deceased father, whom the subject greatly feared. While this was broadly the case, the subject found himself in the position of the attacker, unwillingly committing a series of increasingly violent physical and sexual attacks against his mother and two sisters.
**Additional Comments:** Subject was discovered in his cell the next morning having committed suicide. While SCP-XXX does not directly cause physical harm, clearly the mental effects can result in indirect harm. Care must be taken in the post-processing of subjects, particularly those of continuing value.

**Date:** ██-██-20██
**Subject:** [[[SCP-682]]]
**Info:** O5-██ authorized application of SCP-XXX to SCP-682 under controlled conditions, in order to gauge effectiveness as a control method, or to identify possible weaknesses which may be exploited to effect termination.
**Results:** SCP-682 was restrained during the experiment. Due to the incompatibility of SCP-682's head with SCP-XXX, application was made to right forelimb. Although SCP-682 did not respond to questioning, its attitude and behavior was consistent with the known effects of SCP-682; complete absence of movement from below the neck, blinking and expression suggesting SCP-682 experienced the initial period of blackness. Once the vision period had been in effect for 2 minutes, SCP-682 was asked what it was seeing. SCP-682 did not initially respond, but eventually exclaimed with exasperation that "It looks the same". Pupil tracking confirmed that SCP-682 could see and follow moving objects within the test chamber. Request to release the restraints slightly in order to test if SCP-682 maintained motor control was denied; Although SCP-682 did not move there was concern that this may be a ruse to precipitate an escape attempt.
**Additional Comments:** While SCP-XXX may be effective as a restraint for SCP-682, the unexpected visual results raises doubts to the safety of such use. Current containment to remain in place until a safe test protocol is approved. Several theories have been put forward to explain the visual results of the test:
# Although SCP-XXX has been shown to be effective on non-humans, SCP-682 may be sufficiently biologically divergent as to be immune
# While SCP-XXX was initially effective, SCP-682's evolutionary response may have rapidly counteracted its effect.
# As SCP-682's feelings on biological life in general and its incarceration at the Foundation, it may be that SCP-682 saw what it did because its current situation is truly it's worst fear.

**Date:** ██-██-20██
**Subject:** D14833
**Info:** Profile indicates subject suffers from musophobia, and possesses low levels of intelligence and imagination.
**Results:** As expected the subject confinement in a room with several rodents. When asked if he was being bitten, the subject responded "No... wait, now they are." Further suggestions as to how the vision could be worse (larger rats, being restrained, being confined in a tiny box filled with rats, the rats specifically attacking subjects eyes and genitals) were all subsequently introduced into the subjects vision after a short delay.
**Additional Comments:** While it may be possible for the sequence to be a natural progression similar to that experienced by other subjects, there is a significant correspondence in the timing of the suggestions to their inclusion. It seems that the visions are related to the subjects ability to conceive of the scenario. The escalation may be the natural consequence of the subject speculation on ways in which their situation could be worse. In the case of D14833, the subject was unimaginative enough that such speculation did not occur until prompted.

**Date:** ██-██-20██
**Subject:** D14856
**Info:** Subject was sedated prior to application. SCP-XXX was removed before consciousness was regained.
**Results:** Subject reported disturbing nightmares, but did not seem as effected as previous subjects. Subject did not recognize SCP-XXX and did not resist application. Subject reacted normally and displayed the usual reaction to SCP-XXX afterward.
**Additional Comments:** It seems that the visions still occur during unconsciousness but that the unconscious mind is less effected.

**Date:** ██-██-20██
**Subject:** D148-MSN03
**Info:** Subject is mentally subnormal
**Results:** When questioned about his initial experience, subject responded that there were people "being mean to him". Promptings and suggestions were able to effect the nature of the visions to a degree, however subject was unable anything but the simplest suggestions, and so advanced scenarios did not manifest.
**Additional Comments:** This test seems to confirm the active role that the subjects own imagination plays in determining the nature of the visions, which are limited to that which the subject can conceive.

**Date:** ██-██-20██
**Subject:** [Data Redacted - O5 access required] Captured subject, believed to be a member of [Data Redacted]
**Info:** Due to security clearance issues, SCP-XXX staff were not briefed on the nature of the subject, nor present for application. SCP-XXX was transported to an unknown location for the duration of the interrogation.
**Results:**  Test results remain classified. SCP-XXX staff were informed only that the experiment was "successful" and that SCP-XXX had been "useful".
**Additional Comments:** Following the success of this experiment, protocol SCP-IN465-XXX enacted for the proper authorization and utilization of SCP-XXX on high-level interrogation subjects.

**Date:** ██-██-20██
**Subject:** D14873
**Info:** Profile indicates that subject suffers from ophidiophobia.
**Results:** Rather than a snake related vision as predicted by the subjects profile, the subject instead found himself torturing a number of dogs in various ways. The subject was unable to explain why this should be the case. When threatened with further application, the subject confessed to an incident in his childhood; biometrics together with inconsistencies in the story indicate that it was a fabrication created to avoid application. As an extension to the test, on return to the general population the subject was (falsely) informed that D14850 had committed acts of cruelty against dogs. (D14850 was a convicted serial killer, but no evidence suggests that he was guilty of animal abuse.) D14850 was later found beaten to death by subject, who was subsequently terminated. 
**Additional Comments:** It seems that SCP-XXX is capable of exploiting psychological vulnerabilities even the subject is not aware of. It is also clear that as an interrogation tool, SCP-XXX suffers from the same risks of false-confessions as other advanced interrogation techniques. SCP-IN465-XXX updated accordingly.

**Date:** ██-██-20██
**Subject:** Dr. Alto Clef
**Info:** Dr. Clef overrode security and entered SCP-XXX containment, making mention of "a bet". Dr. Clef then applied SCP-XXX to himself.
**Results:** Dr. Clef did not respond to questioning, other than to insist that SCP-XXX not be removed. After 5 minutes of quiet chuckling, Dr Clef removed SCP-XXX. His only comment was "Cute idea, I'll have to try it for real sometime..."
**Additional Comments:** Dr Clefs ability to retain motor control for removal of SCP-XXX is unprecedented, and casts further doubt on its effectiveness on non-standard biology. Dr Clef has refused to explain how he maintained control or what other subjects may be capable of such a feat. His experience while subjected to SCP-XXX is still undisclosed, although his comment is perhaps the most disturbing result so far.
