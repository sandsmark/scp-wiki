title:Dr Jon Drake's Personnel File
**Name:** "Dr." Jon Drake

**Security Clearance:** Level 3

**Background:** Unknown

**Nationality:** Unknown, though presumed British

**Qualifications:** None documented, though demonstrates doctorate level ability in the fields of BioPhysics, Applied Mathematics and Organic Chemistry

**History:** Unknown prior to ██-██-████. One of the few survivors of the event which [Data Expunged] together with the destruction of the entire facility. Fully establishing what occurred is further complicated by the amnesia suffered by all survivors. It has been confirmed that the being then designated as SCP-███ was neutralized, and speculated that the removal of all personal memories or documentation of the surviving team was probably its final dying act of revenge against its executioners.

Drake and the other survivors were designated as "John Doe's" and held for questioning. While impossible to establish their identity it was possible to confirm the survivor as Foundation staff thanks to [Data Expunged]. After intensive testing and interrogation it was established that none of the survivors suffered any lasting effects other than the amnesia and were classified safe. Most were subsequently terminated as security concerns. Drake only avoided the same fate due to the intervention of ██████████.

Although Drake harbors resentment against the Foundation for his treatment under interrogation, his situation prevents him from finding other work. The Foundation in turn keeps Drake under close observation in case he develops any further abnormalities from the event, but feel he is a valuable enough asset to continue his employment at present.

"Dr." Jon Drake took his new name from that of the British explorer. Although he was found [Data Expunged] after the events at [Data Expunged] his accent would suggest an upbringing in England. Though Drake does not possess any documented qualifications, he insists on being addressed as "Dr.", arguing that just because he can't remember or prove his credentials "that doesn't mean he doesn't deserve a little damn respect." Staff are encouraged to humor him, as he is liable to engage in juvenile reprisals against those he feels have disrespected him. Drake is currently working towards a doctorate in Psychology in order to formalize his honorific.

**Item #:** SCP-XXX

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:**
At least two foundation members must be present for any interaction with SCP-XXX. One member must be designated Monitor and remain at least 6 feet from SCP-XXX at all times. If accidental application occurs, the Monitor should notify the security team. The Monitor MUST NOT attempt removal of SCP-XXX without supervision.

It is recommended that test subjects should not have SCP-XXX applied for more than 180 minutes. Any experiment involving longer application should have security team present for removal, as test subject may behave unpredictably.

SCP-XXX is a standard sized helmet of ancient design. Attempts to date the helmet are inconclusive, but its design would suggest that it is significantly older than the degree of wear would indicate. Either unusual durability is an additional property or SCP-XXX has been well cared for. This is entirely probable, as it was liberated from [Data Expunged] despite frequent use [Data Expunged] how long the group had been in possession of SCP-XXX, as the only surviving members were not present when [Data Expunged] and has itself been designated SCP-███. Efforts are still in place to track down anyone else involved in the incident.

SCP-XXX has the property of inducing visions in any who wear it. Testing indicates that SCP-XXX does not need to be worn on the head, but that insertion of any part of the body within the volume enclosed by the helmet will count as application. Upon application, the subject will be unable to move any part of their body outside SCP-XXX until SCP-XXX is removed. During application the subject will be unable to see, feel or otherwise sense their surroundings, with the exception of sounds which the subject will hear as muted and distant. The subject will also experience highly convincing visual, auditory, olfactory, gustative, tactile and nociceptive hallucinations. The form and nature of the hallucination varies depending on subject. The only common element is the disturbing and unpleasant nature of the hallucinations, focusing on the subjects phobias and neuroses. 

**Addendum A:**

The subject is invariably highly motivated to be removed from SCP-XXX, and will go to great lengths to avoid repeat application. When SCP-XXX is removed, the subject remains physically unharmed, although depending on the duration and nature of the exposure may suffer from PTSD or mental breakdown. Prolonged exposure frequently results in total mental breakdown and insanity.
