**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4190 is kept in a standard Safe-class containment locker in the Anomalous Objects Wing of Site-82.

Personnel experiencing recurring nightmares involving being watched or pursued by shadowy figures are advised to record their experiences in a standard dream report and relay these experiences to Site-82's Psychiatry Office. 

**Description:** SCP-4190 is a 48-page magazine measuring 18 cm by 26 cm, printed on light-weight coated (LWC) paper. 

The magazine's contents feature detailed descriptions of peculiar deep-sea phenomena as observed by divers, submersibles, submarines, autonomous surveillance drones, and fish-based optics.

Subjects that read SCP-4190's cover or contents report experiencing vivid hypnagogic hallucinations[[footnote]]Dream-like sensations occurring before falling asleep.[[/footnote]] followed by nightmares within three to seven days. Reported events vary between subjects; most subjects report the recurring sensation of not being alone in the dream. 

A list of tests with SCP-4190 is as follows.

[[div class="testing-log"]]
= **STANDARD DREAM LOG**
----
**NOTE:** Each subject was requested to read SCP-4190 for approximately 30 minutes in a controlled setting. Any nightmares experienced within a week of reading were to be relayed to a site psychiatric specialist and recorded by an audio device.

Only willing participants were selected for this test.

[[div class="quote-block"]]
**SUBJECT:** D-3467

**ESTIMATED DEGREE OF RECALL:** Low
----
**NIGHTMARE SUMMARY:** Subject reported walking through a damp, dark, narrow hallway. Both the ceiling and the end of the hallway could not be seen at any point during the dream. About halfway through the walk, the subject reported seeing a black figure in their periphery. Turning around failed to reveal its location.
[[/div]]

[[div class="quote-block"]]
**SUBJECT:** D-3852

**ESTIMATED DEGREE OF RECALL:** Medium
----
**NIGHTMARE SUMMARY:** Subject reported arriving at the base of a tall hill at the edge of a dense forest. No illumination -- natural or man-made -- was reported, although the subject claimed it was twilight. Subject climbed the hill. At one point, they stumbled, losing a third of their progress, after which they reported the sensation of being watched. Subject spent the rest of the dream searching for potential predators, but could not locate any.
[[/div]]

[[div class="quote-block"]]
**SUBJECT:** Psionics Specialist Samara Maclear

**ESTIMATED DEGREE OF RECALL:** High
----
**NIGHTMARE SUMMARY:** Subject reported finding themselves out of breath in front of a large black gate surrounded by dead trees and heavy mist. No fences or connective material could be located. After failing to open the gate, the subject turned around 180 degrees and walked away from the barrier; the gate appeared in front of them, stopping them. Subject attempted this act approximately 49 times, to no avail.

Near the end of the dream, subject sighted an indeterminate figure on the other side of the gate ambling toward them. Subject made direct visual contact with the entity for the rest of the dream until the mist became too dense to see.
[[/div]]

[[div class="quote-block"]]
**SUBJECT:** On-Site Researcher Jessie Quattrociocchi

**ESTIMATED DEGREE OF RECALL:** Medium
----
**NIGHTMARE SUMMARY:** Subject experienced a false awakening, believing they were traversing the site. Subject attempted to travel through the site to their parascience research station, noting that the halls had become circuitous, wrapping back into themselves. Subject was lost for most of the dream before they travelled backwards, returning at their quarters; a torn scrap of paper with their handwriting was found on their pillow.

Note reads as follows:

[[div class="note-block"]]
YOU ARE DOING EXCELLENT WORK
PLEASE KEEP IT UP
WE ARE HAVING SO MUCH FUN
WE HARBOUR NO GRUDGE
IT DOES NOT CARE EITHER WAY
THE JOKE CAN NOT DIE
FOR OUR SAKE
