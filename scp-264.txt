**Item #**: SCP-264

**Object Class**: Safe/Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures**: 
SCP-264 is to be contained in a 16 by 16 meter room of standard reinforcement. Two guards are to be stationed outside of room at all times, circulated every twenty-four hours. Room is to be monitored every day for a minimum of two hours. SCP-264 requires no nourishment of any type. No support necessary; SCP-294 suspends itself through unknown source of levitation.

//Note: As of ██/██/200█, only Agents ████ ███████, █████████ █████ [DECEASED], █████ ██████, and Dr. ██████ ████ are permitted to visit SCP- 264. Failure to comply will result in reassignment, pending transgressors condition [See Addendum SCP-264b]. SCP-264 has noted previously some attachment to the aforementioned agents, as they part of the team to origionally discovered [DATA EXPUNGED]. In addition, both Agents ████ ███████ and █████ ██████ were on location during [DATA EXPUNGED]. Suggest keeping them on-site until further notice. -Dr. Carnival//

**Subject Description:**
SCP-264 is a skeleton of humanoid appearance, estimated at two meters of height. Skull is slightly elongated, and two metal protrusions extend from either kneecap. SCP-264s torso and upper pelvis have either been replaced, or consists of, a structure composed of unknown metallic substance. Structure resembles a temple of unknown origin. The structure is composed of several layers of balconies and terraces, with a door located at the approximate center. 

Dozens of carved statues are placed on the structure, in the resemblance of men, women, children and in a few cases, animals. Statues are unable to be removed, although appear to go about the standard activities of any tribal culture when not being viewed, directly.

The structure and skeleton seem to either have been mounted upon, or are part of, a hemisphere composed of what appears to be the same unknown metal. Hemisphere measures in at just over one meter in diameter. The edge of the hemisphere is lined with evenly spaced spikes about an inch in length. Several of the statues have been seen interacting with the sphere in various ways, and seem to be aware of its existence. The back side of the hemisphere is covered in carvings of several languages, including Arabic, Hebrew, German, and ███████. Translation of the ███████ language suspended indeffinately[DATA EXPUNGED [See Addendum 264a]].

SCP-264 is sentient. It communicates through several non-verbal forms, including Japanese, Taiwanese and Korean Sign Language and Morse code. It is most frequently recorded communicating through writing, however, and has been noted writing in nearly every language currently discovered, including the ███████ language. On rare occasions, a designated statue will speak for the SCP; there are only two recorded instances of this happening since its discovery. 

Subject refers to itself as "The Guardian", and refers to the carved statues as separate entities. SCP-264 claims to be the creator of the statues and the structure they "live" in. The statues appear to be aware of "The Guardian's" existence, as they have been observed retrieving several objects from the interior of the hemisphere, where it is presumed the structure expands. Objects retrieved from the interior include a stick of charcoal, papyrus, a small semi-transparent marble of [DATA EXPUNGED][presented to and currently located with Agent ██████], and an SCP still awaiting innitial examination and classification.

How SCP-264 is capable of communicating with its "subjects" is currently unknown, as neither it nor the statues emit any form of psychic read-out. The SCP has aluded to having abilites of precognition, however. Taken from Interview 264a:

> SCP-264: I saw what would happen to the doctor as easily as you see me and my people now.
> Dr. Carnival: How exactly did [y]ou manage to do that?
> SCP-264: I trace the threads of Fate.

SCP-264 refused to elaborate on what it ment. However it can be assumed that through some force unknown, SCP-264 is able to view the path a person may take through the course of their life.

SCP-264 has proved to have knowledge of several other SCP's currently obtained, including [[[SCP-035]]], SCP-███, and SCP-███ [see Interview 264a].

**Addendum 264a**: Due to the actions on 06/10/20██, in which Dr. █████, and the civilian ███ █████ [DATA EXPUNGED], SCP-264 will allow only the aformentioned agents to converse with it. Following the [DATA EXPUNGED], Dr. ██ entered SCP-264s cell to perform several experiments with one of the statues. At 0200, [DATA EXPUNGED]. Several hours later a previously unseen statue was viewed emerging from the doorway located at SCP-264s center. Close-up image proved the statue to be in the likeness of Dr. ██.

**Addendum 264b**: [DATA EXPUNGED].
