Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures
SCP-138 require minimal containment procedures. For humanitarian purposes, subject is currently being kept in a chemically induced comatose state.

Description
SCP-138 is a human male, suspected to be in excess of four thousand (4000) years old. Subject is approximately 1.5 meters in height, emaciated, and wizened. 138's precise origins are unknown; he was discovered by the Foundation in 2006, in the Egyptian tomb located near the original Tutankhamen tomb unearthed in 1922, sealed inside a sarcophagus. When a living being was discovered in the tomb, the Foundation was alerted by one of our sleeper agents assigned to the International Archaeological association. Subject was immediately moved to Sector 37 for investigation by the lead research science team there.

Physiologically, SCP-138 should clinically be dead. Muscles and internal organs are in a severe state of atrophy, and although the subjects bio-electro-magnetic field is stable, his nervous system is also severely debilitated. Subject also exhibits evidence of a large number of fatal wounds, some possibly accidental, some blatantly deliberate, whether by the subject himself or by others. There is no obvious scientific explanation for his continued living state; although other SCPs have exhibited accelerated regenerative properties, allowing them to resist death, SCP-138 has no such abilities; his body does not regenerate damage, but simply continues to function despite them. This stretches to wounding blows - anything that would completely destroy the body, however, proves ineffective. 

Subjects speaks exclusively in a dialect of ancient Egyptian. Communication using a civilian translator have revealed very little about the subject's past; it would appear that he was buried in the Egyptian tomb for an unknown religious purpose. Due to his severely injured state, SCP-138 is in a constant state of agony, and has on numerous occasions insistently requested humanitarian euthanisation. No successful method of termination has yet been found, despite various and varied attempts, both official and unsanctioned. Attached is a comprehensive list of the subjects injuries.
