**Item #:** SCP-138

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:**

SCP-138 is not to be touched at any time unless given explicit instructions by level 4 personnel for testing. Those given permission must pass a psychological check before entering SCP-138's containment chamber.

**Description:**

SCP-138 appears to be a simple steel medallion engraved with the Chinese symbols yin and yang. When touched by a human, SCP-138 produces a "clone" of the person. This clone acts similarly to the original subject, except that its actions are based primarily on an emotion. The most common emotion-clones include happiness, sadness, fear, and anger. During a clone's duration, the original subject feels a lack of whatever emotion their clone takes after. Nearly all clones die after 2-3 hours, and the original subject regains the ability to feel the emotion they had lost.


**Addendum:** I would like to take this opportunity to remind all D-Class personnel that losing the emotion of fear does not, in fact, make you invincible.  It is not advisable for you to attempt to aggravate any sentient SCP, ever. -Dr. Klein
