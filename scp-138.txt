**Item #:** SCP-138

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:**

SCP-138 is not to be touched at any time unless given explicit instructions by level 4 personnel for testing. Those given permission must pass a psychological check before entering SCP-138's containment chamber.

**Description:**

SCP-138 appears to be a simple steel medallion engraved with the Chinese symbols yin and yang. When touched by a human, SCP-138 produces a "clone" of the person. This clone acts similarly to the original subject, except that its actions are based primarily on an emotion. The most common emotion-clones include happiness, sadness, fear, and anger. During a clones duration, the original subject feels a lack of whatever emotion their clone takes after. Nearly all clones end up dying after 2-3 hours, and the original subject regains the ability to feel the emotion they had lost.

**Addendum:** On October 17th, 2006, five subjects were used to test SCP-138. Four of the clones looked perfectly normal, but one clone (henceforth to be referred to as "Dave") was very different. "Dave", a clone of Agent ██████, attacked the other four clones and proceeded to devour their remains. "Dave" is currently pacified in its own cell, but O5-[DATA EXPUNGED] has restricted testing on SCP-138, and Agent ██████ has been taken in for study.

**Addendum-B:** I would like to take this oppurtunity to remind all D-Class personel that losing the emotion of fear does not, in fact, make you invincible.  It is not advisable for you to attempt to aggrivate any sentient SCP, ever. -Dr. Klein
