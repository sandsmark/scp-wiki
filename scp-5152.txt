SCP-5152.
[[/div]]
[[/div]]

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5152 itself is currently uncontainable; however, this is not an immediate issue as visitors to the region it inhabits are rare. An exclusion zone has been established approximately 4km in excess of SCP-5152-1 for increased security and is to be increased in size accordingly if SCP-5152 moves elsewhere. Post-10229 has been constructed near the exclusion zone and serves as an observation center, keeping track of SCP-5152's movements and researching its nature. Several propositions for containment have been devised but all have either failed, been deemed a waste of resources or are awaiting enactment. Development of a means to contain SCP-5152 is considered low-priority.

**Description:** SCP-5152 is a spectral entity inhabiting a northern, heavily forested region of Yukon, Canada designated SCP-5152-1. The exact perimeter of SCP-5152-1 has not been determined due to the nature of SCP-5152's movement, and it is not known if SCP-5152 is capable of leaving it. As of the present, recorded sightings elsewhere have not occurred.

SCP-5152 takes the form of a semi-corporeal humanoid wearing a black veil that obscures its face and body. SCP-5152 also possesses two sets of twig-like appendages in place of hands that extend down the full length of its body, sometimes visible protruding from under the veil. SCP-5152 is generally only visible to a maximum of one individual at any time[[footnote]]Simply put, SCP-5152 will be completely invisible from the perspective of those it chooses to hide from. [[/footnote]], although it occasionally makes itself known to small groups.

If SCP-5152 is near a group of individuals it will typically remain ~100 meters away and silently observe the group for a long period, eventually disappearing out of view. However, if SCP-5152 is near a single individual it may begin following them; walking at a slow pace towards them. This will change if the target individual attempts to observe SCP-5152, resulting in it's temporary disappearance. SCP-5152 will continue following the target individual until they leave SCP-5152-1 or join with a group. 

SCP-5152 first came to the Foundation's attention after sightings of a "hooded figure" were reported to police in Hedder Creek, a small settlement near the perimeter of SCP-5152-1. This figure was seen sparsely over the course of 8 months, lingering at the edges of the forest surrounding the town. A small search for the figure was conducted, but was unsuccessful.

**Addendum 5152.1 - Exploration Log**

As part of an early research effort attempting to discern SCP-5152's area of effect, D-511904 was sent into SCP-5152-1. The events that took place during this exploration have been transcribed below.

**Date:** 5/11/2010
**Location:** SCP-5152-1

**Foreword:** D-511904 was equipped with a headcam, flashlight and thermal jacket, and was instructed to walk in a constant eastward direction through SCP-5152-1.

**Control:** D-511904, do you see anything unusual?

**D-511904:** Just... snow and trees. Creepy though. Did you really have to send me in here at sunset?

**Control:** It's currently 4:38 PM.

**D-511904:** Yeah right.

<<13 minutes of extraneous footage removed>>

**D-511904:** Uh... guys... you didn't send any others in here, did you?

**Control:** Negative.

**D-511904:** I can hear... footsteps. In the snow.

**Control:** Noted. Where are they coming from?

**D-511904:** Behind me, I think. I can only hear it when I'm walking- if I stop I can... I can hear it stop after me.

**Control:** We have reason to believe an entity may be following you. Your best course of action is to keep moving.

**D-511904:** Okay. I don't have a problem with that.

//The sound of a tree branch snapping is heard.//

**D-511904:** //(Whispering)// What was that?

**Control:** Elaborate.

**D-511904:** I didn't step on a... on a twig.

**Control:** Just keep moving forwards.

**D-511904:** It's just...

**Control:** What?

**D-511904:** I keep feeling like something's right behind me. I can hear it... breathing. Crunching through the snow. It's so close but- every time I turn around... nothing's there.

//D-511904 reaches a clearing; a wooden cabin at the center.//

**D-511904:** Y'know... I remember this place. Or at least a place like it.

**Control:** How so? Do you remember any details?

**D-511904:** I can if I try. Thing is, I'm pretty sure you guys wiped my memory. Can't remember anything before I was in my cell. Good play. Except... this cabin... I remember... something. It's like re-entered my brain.

**Control:** Please remember that casual conversation is not allowed. This only serves as a source of information.

**D-511904:** I guessed that.

**Control:** Let's hear it.

//D-511904 pauses for a moment to think as he approaches the cabin.//

**D-511904:** I... remember walking to school through a forest like this. My family lived in this little village miles away from town, and in the winter it got too snowy for us to drive there. So I went alone. I walked for hours, and I arrived like halfway through classes. But I still wanted to go every day. I was uh... a weird kid.

**Control:** And you think it may have been here you walked through?

**D-511904:** It certainly reminds me of the place. Where is this?

**Control:** This forest is in Yukon, Canada.

**D-511904:** Y'know, it could be the same place. I bet //it// wants me back.

**Control:** Hm?

**D-511904:** Nothing. I'm at the cabin now.

**D-511904:** I'm in.

**Control:** The camera seems to be malfunctioning. Please give a description of the cabin's interior.

**D-511904:** It's... empty. Just a bunch of planks on the floor. Good condition, though. This place must've belonged to somebody.

**Control:** Do you see any other rooms?

**D-511904:** It's a little dark in here. Wait, I think there's a- //(unintelligible)//

**Control:** D-511904?

**D-511904:** Yeah, I'm here. There's one other room. Very small... there's uh- a bed in here. That's a little weird. Looks kinda like the one I used to have as a... huh.

**Control:** There's nothing else in the room?

**D-511904:** Not that I can see, no.

**Control:** Noted. Leave the cabin.

**D-511904:** What the... G-get away from me!

//SCP-5152 begins to approach D-511904 but is unsuccessful as D-511904 kicks through a nearby window and runs out of the clearing, back into the forest.//

**D-511904:** It's like this place goes on forever.

**Control:** Have you heard any footsteps since you escaped the creature?

**D-511904:** No. That thing scared the living daylights out of me. It's weird though... I was telling you 'bout the walk to school earlier. More's coming back to me now. Something about that- that creature.

**Control:** Go ahead.

//D-511904 sighs. A moment of silence.//

**D-511904:** After school me and my friends would walk back home together. I would always be the last one left, of course. But sometimes when we were there, we heard... we heard these- weird noises. Far off in the deeper forest. We'd- see stuff move too. We thought they were elk, deer. Now I'm not so sure. Maybe if this is the place... maybe //it// wants me back. Your entity.
