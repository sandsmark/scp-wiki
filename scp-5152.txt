**CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES:** SCP-5152 itself is currently uncontainable; however, this is not a serious issue as visitors to the region it inhabits are rare. An exclusion zone has been established roughly 4km in excess of SCP-5152-1 for increased security, and is to be increased in size accordingly if SCP-5152 leaves it. Post-10229 has been constructed near the exclusion zone and serves as an observation center, keeping track of SCP-5152's movements and researching its nature. Several propositions for containment have been devised but all have either failed, been deemed a waste of resources or are awaiting enactment. Development of a means to contain SCP-5152 is considered low-priority.

**DESCRIPTION:** SCP-5152 is a spectral entity inhabiting a northern, heavily forested region of Yukon, Canada designated SCP-5152-1. The exact perimeter of SCP-5152-1 has not been determined due to the nature of SCP-5152's movement, and it is not known if SCP-5152 is capable of leaving it, but as of the present, recorded sightings elsewhere have not occurred.

SCP-5152 takes the form of a semi-corporeal humanoid wearing a black veil that obscures its face and body. SCP-5152 also possesses two sets of twig-like claws in place of hands that extend down the full length of its body, sometimes visible protruding from under the veil. SCP-5152 is generally only visible to a maximum of one individual at any time, although it occasionally makes itself known to small groups.

If SCP-5152 is near a group of individuals it will typically remain a large distance away and silently "observe" them for a long period, eventually disappearing out of view. However, if SCP-5152 is near a single individual it may begin following them; walking at a slow pace towards them. This will change if the target individual attempts to observe SCP-5152, resulting in its temporary disappearance. SCP-5152 will continue following the target individual until they leave SCP-5152-1 or join with a group. SCP-5152 first came to the Foundation's attention after sightings of a "hooded figure" were reported to police in Hedder Creek, a small settlement near the perimeter of SCP-5152-1. This figure was seen sparsely over the course of roughly 8 months, lingering at the edges of the forest surrounding the town. A small search for this figure was conducted, but was unsuccessful.

**Addendum 5152.1 - Exploration Log**

As part of an early research effort attempting to discern SCP-5152's area of effect, D-511904 was sent into SCP-5152-1. The events that transpired during this exploration have been transcribed below.
[[div style="background:#E5E5E5; margin: 5%; padding:3%;text-align:left;"]]

------

**Date:** 5/11/2010
**Location:** SCP-5152-1

**Foreword:** D-511904 was equipped with a headcam, flashlight and thermal jacket, and was instructed to walk in a constant eastward direction through SCP-5152-1.

**Control:** D-511904, do you see anything unusual?

**D-511904:** Just... snow and trees. Creepy though. Did you really have to send me in here at sunset?

**Control:** You started the exploration at 4:15 PM. The sun has not set at the post.

**D-511904:** Nah... you guys are just playin' with me. It's later than that for sure.

**Control:** It's currently 4:38 PM.

**D-511904:** Yeah right.

<<13 minutes of extraneous footage removed>>

**D-511904:** Uh... guys... you didn't send any others in here, did you?

**Control:** Negative. Why?

**D-511904:** I can hear... footsteps. In the snow.

**Control:** Noted. Where are they coming from?

**D-511904:** Behind me, I think. I can only hear it when I'm walking- if I stop I can... I can hear it stop after me.

**Control:** We have reason to believe an entity may be following you. Your best course of action is to keep moving.

**D-511904:** Okay. I don't have a problem with that.

<<2 minutes of extraneous footage removed>>

//The sound of a tree branch snapping is heard.//

**D-511904:** //(Whispering)// What was that?

**Control:** Elaborate.

**D-511904:** I didn't step on a... on a twig.

**Control:** Just keep moving forwards.

**D-511904:** It's just...

**Control:** What?

**D-511904:** I keep feeling like something's right behind me. I can hear it... breathing. Crunching through the snow. It's so close but- every time I turn around... nothing's there.

**Control:** Noted. Please continue.

<<15 minutes of extraneous footage removed>>

//D-511904 reaches a clearing; a wooden cabin at the center.//

**D-511904:** Y'know... I remember this place. Or at least a place like it.

**Control:** How so? Do you remember any details?

**D-511904:** I can if I try. Thing is, I'm pretty sure you guys wiped my memory. Can't remember anything before I was in my cell. Good play. Except... this cabin... I remember... something. It's like re-entered my brain.

**Control:** Please remember that casual conversation is not allowed. This only serves as a source of information.

**D-511904:** Yeah, I know.

**Control:** Alright, let's hear it.

//D-511904 pauses for a moment to think as he approaches the cabin.//

**D-511904:** I... remember walking to school through a forest like this. My family lived in this little village miles away from town, and in the winter it got too snowy for us to drive there. So I went alone. I walked for hours, and I arrived like halfway through classes. But I still wanted to go every day. I was uh... a weird kid.

**Control:** And you think it may have been here you walked through?

**D-511904:** It certainly reminds me of the place. Where is this?

**Control:** This forest is in Yukon, Canada.

**D-511904:** Y'know, it could be the same place. I bet //it// wants me back.

**Control:** It?

**D-511904:** Nothing. I'm at the cabin now.

**Control:** You have permission to enter.

//D-511904 enters the cabin.//

**D-511904:** I'm in.

**Control:** What's it like inside? Your camera isn't picking this up well.

**D-511904:** It's... empty. Just a bunch of planks on the floor. Good condition, though. This place must've belonged to somebody.

**Control:** Do you see anything else in there? Are there any other rooms?

**D-511904:** It's a little dark in here. Wait, I think there's a- //(unintelligible)//

**Control:** D-511904, do you copy?

**D-511904:** Yeah, I'm here. There's one other room. Very small... there's uh- a bed in here. That's a little weird. Looks kinda like the one I used to have as a... huh.

**Control:** There's nothing else in the room?

**D-511904:** Not that I can see, no.

**Control:** Alright, leave the cabin.

//D-511904 turns around to leave the room but is intercepted by SCP-5152 standing in front of the door.//

**Control:** Quickly, leave through the windows!

//D-511904 stands still for 10 seconds, staring at SCP-5152 with confusion and fear. SCP-5152 begins to approach D-511904 but is unsuccessful as D-511904 kicks through a nearby window and runs out of the clearing, back into the forest.//

<<1.3 hours of extraneous footage removed>>

**D-511904:** It's like this place goes on forever.

**Control:** Have you heard any footsteps since you escaped the creature?

**D-511904:** No. That thing scared the living daylights out of me. It's weird though... I was telling you 'bout the walk to school earlier. More's coming back to me now. Something about that- that creature.

**Control:** Go ahead.

//D-511904 sighs. A moment of silence.//

**D-511904:** After school me and my friends would walk back home together. I would always be the last one left, of course. But sometimes when we were there, we heard... we heard these- weird noises. Far off in the deeper forest. We'd- see stuff move too. We thought they were elk, deer. Now I'm not so sure. Maybe if this is the place... maybe //it// wants me back. Your entity. Maybe that's what I saw.

**Control:** This information has been helpful, D-511904.

**D-511904:** Yeah.

<<14 minutes of extraneous footage removed>>

//D-511904 looks to his right and begins running, breathing heavily.//

**Control:** D-511904, what's your status?

**D-511904:** I saw it again!

**Control:** Noted. Where was it?

**D-511904:** It was like... passing through a gap in the trees. Just for a... for a split second.

**Control:** Is it still following you?

**D-511904:** Uh... I couldn't tell you. Probably.

**Control:** Do you hear anything abnormal?

//D-511904 stops running.//

**D-511904:** //(Catching breath)// No... that's... weird. It's just silence. I can barely hear the wind.

**Control:** Keep moving forward.

**D-511904:** Yeah, of course.

<<16 minutes of extraneous footage removed>>

**Control:** Have you seen it again?

**D-511904:** No. Still just nothing. I think it's gone.

//SCP-5152 suddenly emerges near D-511904 and begins walking towards him at an increased pace, emitting a low-pitched groaning sound.//

**Control:** D-511904, leave the area immediately; turn west!

//D-511904 screams, falling to the floor. SCP-5152 is approaching him slowly with it's claws outstretched. The sound of a bell ringing in the distance is heard.//

**D-511904:** Leave me alone! Get away from me- you... you thing! What are you? Why did you follow me as a boy? What do you want from me? Why won't you leave me alone? Why did you //never// leave me alone?

//D-511904's headcam falls onto the ground. SCP-5152 extends it's claws and covers D-511904 under its veil before demanifesting; D-511904 with it. Footsteps can be heard in the snow, moving away until they are no longer picked up by the microphone.//
