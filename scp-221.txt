**Item #:** SCP-XXX

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-XXX is to be kept in a locked container where it cannot be removed except for further testing by Security Clearance Level 2 Personnel. The container is a six-inch by six-inch steel box with a cushioned interior, with a internal locking system. The container is to be placed in a locked room, with a guard to ensure that SCP-XXX is not taken.


**Description:** SCP-XXX is a pair of tweezers made out of gold, made in the 16th or 17th century. SCP-XXX is unbreakable and unbendable, but can be scored and scratched, allowing for a sample to be gathered off of it for material testing. After subject testing it was noted that the areas which had been used to gather samples were smaller than they had been prior to the test. It is currently theorized that SCP-XXX uses the minute amounts of gold in the human body to regenerate damage to itself.

Subject testing revealed that SCP-XXX creates a highly focused case of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder in any person which uses it on their own body. Subjects will utilize SCP-XXX to slowly remove any and all hair from their body, before removing finger and toenails, as well as teeth, culminating with the removal of organs, both the internal, such as the liver and pancreas, and the external, such as the eyes and skin, using their hands if SCP-XXX is not effective (though one SCP-XXX will never be set aside during this process, and remains gripped in one of the subject's hands). If SCP-XXX is taken away from the subject, they become violent and manic, and will use their hands to continue the process, albeit in a less careful manner. It is to be noted that the progression of this behavior is different for each subject, but no less fatal. 

SCP-XXX came into Foundation possession after reports of a human being who was [DATA EXPUNGED]. Foundation personnel retrieved the SCP within a 10 hours of the original report.


**Addendum:** 

**Test Log 1A:** The test subject, a Class-D, was ordered to use SCP-XXX to remove his eyebrow hair. While the subject was initially unenthusiastic about his task, after the first 10 minutes he began to begin to more actively pluck out his own eyebrow hair, and after completely denuding his brow, moved on to plucking out his eyelashes, despite repeated assertions that the test was over. When released after SCP-XXX was taken out of the room, he began to pluck out his eyelashes with his own fingers, completely removing all of them before moving on to his toenails. The subject completely removed his toe and fingernails, before yelling and smashing his own face against a wall. The reason for this outburst became apparent when he reached into his mouth and began ripping out his now loosened teeth. Eventually the subject died from bloodloss and shock, halfway through the task of pulling out his own internal organs.
