**Item #:** SCP-3787

**Object Class:** --Keter-- Hiemal

**Special Containment Procedures:** 
> As the anomaly associated with SCP-3787 continues to change over time, it has been documented in chronological order. All observed changes to the properties of this anomaly are to be documented as addenda materials. Only the most recent version of this anomaly's containment procedures are to be considered viable. The original 2021/06/30 documentation is as follows.

Foundation personnel within the Zoology Department are to be inserted into various tiers of the North American horse industry. This is to ensure horse breeding continues as a controlled element to avoid further progression of the anomaly.

Domesticated horse populations are to be monitored for anomalous effects such as uncharacteristic or unprovoked aggression, deviance from feeding habits, and deviance from natural breeding cycles. As the numbers of feral horse populations cannot be properly quantified, known populations are to be monitored and tracked for behaviour that deviates from the norm. 

Sterilization efforts of current horse populations in an attempt to slow down birth rates and overpopulation are to be avoided to ensure no deviance to the well-being of baseline horse populations. Instead, hormonal agent 762988-16-7 is to be dispersed among horse populations. 762988-16-7 targets horse endocrine systems to promote docility and extend breeding cycles.

Due to the nature of SCP-3787-ε as a widespread anomaly, there are no known methods of containment at this time. Containment initiatives are being accepted by Site-82. Until such a point that acceptable levels of containment have been met, this anomaly has been classified as a Keter-class object.

**Description:** SCP-3787-A describes a deviance to the natural breeding trend within domesticated and free-roaming //Equus ferus caballus//[[footnote]]Common horse.[[/footnote]] populations. This deviance has been noted to exist primarily in the Southern and Southwestern United States, though horse populations within the entirety of the US and Canada are potential vectors for this anomaly.

Specifically, SCP-3787-A refers to the emergence of a gestation period 8 to 10 times more rapid than the baseline breeding cycle. The baseline gestation period of 11 to 12 months is shortened to a roughly 30 to 45 day period from conception to birth among horses affected by SCP-3787-A, and up to 10 times as many foals are born as a result. Growth rates of this magnitude over an extended period of time are considered vastly unsustainable and pose a serious risk to the horse industry's ability to maintain it. 

Horses involved in this breeding cycle, including both newborn foals and pregnant mares, appear not to be negatively affected by this accelerated gestation period. Newborn foals exhibit physiological properties similar in nature to their non-anomalous counterparts and develop within pregnant mares despite lacking the necessary sustenance over the accelerated developmental period.

SCP-3787-B describes an anomalous increase in horse aggression in free-roam horse populations. SCP-3787-B has been observed primarily in the mustang populations of Nevada, where the largest feral horse population in North America exists. Examples of aggression include unprovoked hostilities toward horses outside a constituent pack (leading to fatalities), the active killing of most or all members of a feral horse pack by that pack's dominant stallion, and in some cases, the cannibalization of foals as a show of dominance[[footnote]]A full list of observed hunting behaviour can be found in Document 3787.0031.[[/footnote]].

Increase in horse hostility has extended into normal horse feeding patterns as well. Feral horse packs affected by this anomaly will carry out apparently organized attacks on other wildlife as a means of feeding, escalating to the point of ignoring herbivorous feeding habits. This occurs despite horses being biologically unsuited for meat consumption in terms of their jaw structures and digestive systems. This manner of aggression has led to the progression of horses to the top of the food chain in many areas.

SCP-3787-B appears to have initially begun in newborn foals affected by SCP-3787-A but has since transferred to an unknown number of horse populations of varying ages based on a geometric infection model. In addition, this anomaly has developed in the same time frame and area as a second equine anomaly. This anomaly, designated SCP-3787-ε, refers to the immediate consequences of a marked increase of total horse populations, which has led to the increase of the equine in the human consciousness.

SCP-3787-ε is the designation given to an anomalous memetic form of equinophobia. This is the emergence of an intense fear of horses among humans with no previous basis to fear horses. Individuals may not be aware that they have been affected by this anomaly until they have been re-exposed to the concept of horses through forms of media, or through personal conversations that reference horses.

SCP-3787-ε occurs in suburban areas and urban centres, and among populations far from rural communities. More specifically, SCP-3787-ε occurs among populations with little access to that which is equine in nature[[footnote]]Domesticated stud farms are an example of a resource unreachable to populations in these kinds of communities, though it can be noted that populations immediately interested in thoroughbred horse racing have not been affected.[[/footnote]]. Individuals within these populations with a fascination of horses on any level are not affected by this anomaly. An estimated 350,000 individuals within the continental United States (approximately 0.1% of the total population) are believed to have contracted this anomaly.

**Addendum 3787-1:** On 2021/06/30, Foundation efforts to reduce the heightened equine birth rate were deemed successful, and the median horse gestation period levelled out to approximately 1.5 times the baseline. In the two months since the anomaly was detected, approximately 450,000 new horses are believed to have been birthed in the United States alone.

On 2021/07/12, domesticated horse populations began to contract what is hypothesized to be an anomalous illness. Horses affected by this illness experience a period of extreme stress, leaving them in a comatose state, and eventually killing them in approximately 18.5% of cases. Current trends predict that approximately 37% of horses in the Southern and Southwestern United States are afflicted with this illness.

Research efforts into a cure for this illness have, as of 2021/07/29, proven ineffective.

**Addendum 3787-2:** Since 2021/07/12, approximately 1.1 million horses in the US are believed to have been killed as a result of the accelerated spread of this illness. On 2021/08/10, Site-82, in conjunction with the Scientific Department, published a report regarding PROJECT: DIRE HORSE to SCiPNET. A summary of the report is as follows.

++++ Document 3787.0142: Summary of PROJECT: DIRE HORSE

[[include component:image-block name=http://scpsandbox2.wdfiles.com/local--files/floppyphoenix/factory-farm|caption=Ashleigh's Fields]]

PROJECT: DIRE HORSE outlines the production of a significant synthetic horse population and the dissemination of this new population across the United States. This is to be done to substantially mitigate the ongoing loss of horse populations and to produce a phenotype resistant to the effects of the anomalous illness. To achieve this goal, DIRE HORSE has employed the use of Ashleigh's Fields, a cattle farm in Newton News, Montana, which has been operating under the Foundation front company Stratford Cattle Productions since 2010. Ashleigh's Fields uses an industrial farming facility responsible for the mass production of synthetic livestock in the place of modern farming techniques.

DIRE HORSE makes use of the newly constructed Rimmer-Lister Hippological Simulacrum (RLHS) prototype. The RLHS is capable of producing 500 artificially grown adult horses, or approximately 1,000 foals, per hour, within 99.91% genetic similarity of their natural counterparts. Horses produced by the RLHS are behaviorally engineered and memetically hardened to reduce the potential effects of an SCP-3787-B spread into its population. In the event of a runaway equine extinction due to SCP-3787, the RLHS and its sentinel facility at Aisleighfield Farms are capable of cryonically storing up to 100,000 stable horses for a period of up to 10 years. 

Further information on the technical and logistical specifications of the RLHS can be found in Document 3787.0155.

In an effort to reduce public awareness of the full extent of SCP-3787's spread, DIRE HORSE is to begin immediately to replace horse populations in 35 different states. Information regarding this process is to be outlined in Document 3787.0157. Any expired horses having come into contact with SCP-3787 are to be collected and sent to Site-41 for decommissioning purposes.

[[include component:image-block name=http://scpsandbox2.wdfiles.com/local--files/floppyphoenix/Site-blank.jpg|caption=Site-41 during Procedure: IRISH WRISTWATCH]]

To prevent environmental contamination, any expired horses believed to have been affected by SCP-3787 at any point in their lifespan are to be tagged and collected for decommissioning purposes. The nature of this decommissioning is as follows:

* Foundation personnel planted in various positions in the North American Horse Industry are to make note of all areas affected by mass die-offs due to SCP-3787.
* The full extent of SCP-3787 effects in affected areas, including the number of expired horses, the source of the infection, and the speed of the infection's spread, is to be archived.
* Expired horses identified during this process are to be forcibly removed from the affected area on an immediate basis.
* Civilians aware of the full effect SCP-3787 has had on affected areas are to be amnesticized using Class-A Amnestics.
* Mass media blackouts regarding SCP-3787 are to be carried out, such that any uncontained reports on SCP-3787 are to be purged by a network of Foundation web crawlers.
* Expired horses are to be taken to Site-41 for neutralization. Neutralization is outlined below. A randomly selected pool of approximately 1,100 expired horses (0.1% of all horses killed by SCP-3787) are to be stored for future testing.

Neutralization efforts are to be carried out with the end goal of destroying all expired horses affected by SCP-3787. As per Procedure: IRISH WRISTWATCH, all destroyed subjects are to be summarily broken down into a component slurry to begin the transformation into Class-W, -X, and -Y mnestics material, as the primary component of modern mnestics is an admixture of various parts of horse anatomy[[footnote]]See Dr L. Marness' //Understanding Antimemetics, First Edition// published in 1976.[[/footnote]]. As of 2021/08/20, this aspect of PROJECT: DIRE HORSE has been taken over by the --Antimemetics Division--[[footnote]][DATA LOST][[/footnote]].

**Addendum 3787-3:** On 2021/09/03 at 01:04 AM, unknown anomalous entities attempted to force access into Site-41 before being repelled by automated lockdown procedures. A transcript of the encounter, as recorded by on-site surveillance, is as follows.

> [[collapsible show="+ Open transcript?" hide="- Close" hideLocation="bottom"]]
> **Preface:** Due to the high volume of antimemetic anomalies on-site, all cameras at Site-41 are outfitted with a Mariotte-Pashler antimemetic perception filter, as well as standard night vision. This allows for the surveillance of most documented forms of antimemetic or counterconceptual anomalies. For the sake of identification purposes, the cameras outline anomalies corresponding to this description are highlighted in red.

> **<BEGIN LOG, 01:04 AM>**
> 
> //A large wheel-shaped entity comes into view approximately 350 meters from Site-41[[footnote]]Upon later inspection of the surveillance logs, the entity appears to be formed by the array of eight individual entities working in tandem.[[/footnote]]. The entity is identified by a contrasting red against the green hue of the surveillance footage. The wheel-like anatomical structure bypasses a surveillance pylon by rolling through it at approximately 50 km/h, taking out two of the pylon's legs. Security alarms begin to emit a high-pitched whine as the entity continues toward the site, at which point it begins to slow.//
> 
> //MTF-Chai-10 ("Oxygenated Morons"), a three-man fast-insertion unit, comes into view, approaching the entity on a military ATV outfitted with an M2 heavy machine gun. At this point, the entity forms a ball and begins to expand.//

> 
> **MTF-Chai-10-3:** Firing.
> 
> //MTF-Chai-10-3 fires a 5-second long burst at the entity, expelling 75 rounds. The entity's outer layer makes a popping sound before loud equine vocalizations are emitted from the deflated form. An individual entity separates from the larger entity and gallops towards MTF-Chai-10.//
> 
> **MTF-Chai-10-2:** A horse? What?
> 
> //MTF-Chai-10-2, who is operating the vehicle, begins to reverse, before circling the larger entity in a wide arc. The individual entity matches speed and chases the unit for approximately forty seconds, before latching itself to the back of the ATV. The larger entity then disappears from view.//
> 
> //MTF-Chai-10-3 fires a 10-second burst directly at the individual entity, expelling 150 rounds. At this point, the entity is noted to break apart into multiple smaller portions. The scattered portions continue to move, implanting themselves onto various places of the ATV.// 
> 
> **MTF-Chai-10-2:** Keep firing.
> 
> **MTF-Chai-10-3:** The thing's Swiss cheese, I don't have anything to fire at!
> 
> //Smaller portions of the entity enter open sections of the ATV. Eventually, the ATV ceases operation.//

> 
> **MTF-Chai-10-2:** Not sure. Let's go.
> 
> //MTF-Chai-10 exits the ATV and makes their way to the side of Site-41. They enter through a large blast door, which automatically reinforces itself upon closing. Outside, the visible entity remains latched to the ATV, slowly squeezing the rest of its body into the vehicle. Equine vocalizations continue for the next 10 minutes.//
> 
> //After 10 minutes, the larger entity appears approximately 100 meters from the facility. The entity takes the form of a large ball approximately 2 meters in diameter.//
> 
> //The entity begins to roll towards the facility, gaining incredible speed. It moves towards the site at approximately 100 km/h, impacting the side of the facility and causing structural damage. The camera shakes from the impact, sending it offline. Audio surveillance continues.//
> 
> //Site systems at this point log the activation of high-powered 2000W floodlights located around the facility. This is an automated feature to prevent intruders via disorientation before weaponized systems activate.//
> 
> //Audio surveillance picks up a sharp equine vocalization, loud at first, but eventually becoming faint. It is thought at this point that the entity must have been damaged by the light, and retreated accordingly, before exiting the audio surveillance's effective range.//
> 
> **<END LOG, 01:26 AM>**
> 
> **Remarks:** No further sightings of the larger entity have been reported after 01:26 AM. By morning, when lockdown lifted, an investigation into the entity within the ATV was completed. The entity within the ATV was found blackened and shrivelled, apparently terminated by prolonged exposure to the intense light. Extended research into the nature of these entities, which have been individually designated as SCP-3787-n, has begun.

**Addendum 3787-4:** On 2021/09/05, individuals known to be affected by SCP-3787-ε experienced a spontaneous shift in anatomy, becoming more equine in nature. Not all affected individuals were able to make a full transformation[[footnote]]What was previously known anomalous equinophobia is now no longer present among affected individuals.[[/footnote]], with some expiring before the full transformation became possible. Individuals undergoing this transformation have been given the designation SCP-3787-ε-1.

In addition to this, Foundation personnel specializing in antimemetics training have begun to make note of large numbers of SCP-3787-n. These entities have begun to appear en masse as a direct result of extended Foundation efforts to control North American horse population numbers[[footnote]]A conclusion reached based on the short time span between PROJECT: DIRE HORSE and the first sighting of SCP-3787-n, as well as their appearances near common horse populations.[[/footnote]]. The appearance of these entities has prompted the reclassification of SCP-3787 to a Hiemal-class anomaly.

A full description of SCP-3787-n is as follows.

[[collapsible show="+ Description of SCP-3787-n" hide="- Close" hideLocation="bottom"]]
Each instance of SCP-3787-n is part of a collective of highly predatory anomalous organisms. SCP-3787-n are vaguely humanoid equine entities, each composed of a highly malleable cartilage structure integrated with groupings of musculature typical of the common horse.  Instances are covered in a thin epidermis with slight brown colouration.

A defining feature of SCP-3787-n is the cranium, which is similar in shape to that of a horse, but on a smaller scale. At the bottom of the cranium is a muzzle of equine nature, from which equine vocalizations are possible. As well, naturally occurring braided hair similar in consistency to that of horsehair is visible in the form of a mane and a tail. Each individual strand of horsehair is apparently autonomous, despite SCP-3787-n's efforts to remain static in its positioning.

While SCP-3787-n have dull rounded teeth, instances have been observed to take part in strictly carnivorous activities. Instances will mainly consume human beings, but have also been observed to consume instances of SCP-3787-ε-1. Despite this, however, SCP-3787-n do not appear to feed for sustenance purposes, and instead, choose to hunt for recreational purposes.

All appendages, including the arms, legs, and tail, are fully capable of being contorted, elongated, and wrapped around themselves. The extent of this manipulation is detailed below.

Each instance of SCP-3787-n attacks in a manner solely involving their bodies, or in conjunction with other SCP-3787-n as a group. Despite their intelligent nature, the use of tools or equipment by SCP-3787-n has not been observed.

For example, SCP-3787-n will balloon their body as a form of defence. Instances will also mount each other, combining in tandem with the formation of wheel-like anatomical structures. This is done in an effort to use their collective body masses as vehicles for transportation. When this occurs, speeds of up to 100 km/h have been observed, though further velocities are theoretically possible.

It appears that SCP-3787-n have a strong revulsion towards most forms of visible light, which damages them. Personnel making contact with SCP-3787-n are advised to carry any forms of light-based weaponry available, ranging from LED spotlights to hard light weaponry prototypes. No other means of damaging SCP-3787-n are known at this time.

Nearly all SCP-3787-n have been sighted in nocturnal settings, which has led them to become colloquially known as "Nighters" among Foundation personnel. SCP-3787-n manifest in groups ranging from 5 to 500 instances, and typically manifest in a close proximity to domestic and thoroughbred horse farms, SCP-3787-ε-1, and feral horse packs. 
[[/collapsible]]

Since the appearance of SCP-3787-n as a collective, North American horses have begun to deviate from their normal behaviour[[footnote]]Horses produced as a result of PROJECT: DIRE HORSE have not been noted to deviate from their standard behaviour.[[/footnote]]. Nearly all horse populations have begun to display SCP-3787-B and attack humans, leading to civilian casualties beyond Foundation control. In areas with a high volume of SCP-3787-ε-1 instances, SCP-3787-ε-1 as a population[[footnote]]Which has been hypothesized to currently amass around 700,000 individuals.[[/footnote]] has begun to form large groups despite pre-existing human class structures. These groups have begun a mass pilgrimage to an as of yet undesignated area in the American Southwest, being lead by groups of SCP-3787-n. How the two groups communicate is currently under active investigation.

In addition to this, numerous North American equine anomalies have begun acting in an anomalous manner that deviates from their documented behaviour. Equine anomalies seem to have taken an adversarial position on humanity as a whole and are acting in the best interests of SCP-3787-n populations. A full list of the changes to these anomalies is as follows.

||~ Equine Anomaly ||~ Documented Behaviour ||~ Behaviour Post-SCP-3787 Emergence ||
|| [[[SCP-042]]] || A wounded sapient horse that spreads a sense of euphoria after making physical contact. The horse destroys most forms of vegetation it makes contact with by dehydrating them. || SCP-042 manifested a wingspan approximately 15 meters in width, which it used to breach containment by flying over the fence of its enclosure. Contact with SCP-042 was lost for approximately 3  hours as it entered a high altitude. Contact was remade when Foundation personnel became aware of reports of a flying horse above Sedalia, Missouri. When personnel arrived, nearly all of the city's 21,000 citizens had been afflicted with "horse fever", which made them believe they were horses. The use of amnestics has not been able to reverse the effects of "horse fever". ||
|| [[[SCP-1556]]] || A group of 15 mustangs that manifests during foggy conditions in the American Midwest. || SCP-1556 manifested in downtown Houston, Texas, after a dense fog and gale force winds were reported. The horses were highly hostile and engaged in attacks against civilians for approximately 16 hours. Attacked civilians were later reported to behave in an equine manner and were later designated as instances of SCP-3787-ε-1. Over 3,400 civilians are estimated to have been affected by this anomaly. ||
|| [[[SCP-2514]]] || A horse that sings a modified version of "Happy Birthday to You" at a high volume, instilling joyful memories into anyone that listens, while emitting pyrotechnics. || The Director of Area-12 found SCP-2514 out of containment and inside his office. After following the Director around for the next 12 hours and causing damage to its surroundings with pyrotechnics, SCP-2514 de-manifested. The next day, on 2021/09/07, SCP-2514 re-manifested within Site-17 and spontaneously turned all human-produced food within 1 kilometre of Site-17 into horse feed, while following around any personnel with a birthday. Site-17 personnel were advised not to consume the horse feed. All food shipped to Site-17 within the next 36 hours was also rendered as horse feed. After 72 hours, personnel attempting to consume the horse feed fell into a comatose state and began to emit equine vocalizations. ||
|| [[[SCP-3996]]] || An intangible feral horse pack that manifests within the Nevada Great Basin desert every 12 hours. Individuals that choose to ride on the horse pack during this manifestation are brought to a tangent dimension with a high Hume level. || SCP-3996 manifested in a relatively normal manner. Agent Emile, upon mounting one of the manifested horses, expected to be brought to the tangential frontier of SCP-3996-1. Instead, Agent Emile was taken to the apparent homeworld of SCP-3787-n instances[[footnote]]View [[span style="color:red"]]Incident Log I-3996.3787[[/span]][[/footnote]]. ||

As of the creation of this document, the aforementioned equine anomalies have yet to be re-contained. 

Current SCP-3787-n efforts appear to be directed toward creating an equine ethnostate composed of both horses and SCP-3787-ε-1 populations. Contact with passing equine populations by any non-equine populations has led to confrontative behaviour by SCP-3787-n, mostly in an effort to protect equine populations. Foundation personnel attempting to hinder the effects of SCP-3787 also face aggression by SCP-3787-n, and in some cases become transformed into horses by unknown means.

**Addendum 3787-5:** MTF-Pi-3 ("Glue Factory") has been formed to repel the attacks of SCP-3787-n. Each member of MTF-Pi-3 has been specially trained to deal with antimemetic anomalies and are to remain on a strict Class-W mnestic prescription. A summary of the task force's equipment is as follows:

* 40 combat operatives using light-based weaponry such as the 1000W N-62A Laser Optics Pistol, the 2000W G1A Tactical Solid-state Laser Rifle, and the prototype █████W Basok-Prokhorov RX-7Z Hard Light Heavy Rifle "Nulltaker"
* 4000 lm flashlights and interfaces utilizing night vision and blue-light eye protection lenses
* 15 Polaris MV800 ATV medium support vehicles outfitted with Light Reconnaissance Laser Optics (LaLo) gun platforms
* 10 Chenoweth RAV light action support vehicles
* 4 SL/SX Support Drones utilizing Mariotte-Pashler antimemetic perception filters

Despite the formation of MTF-Pi-3, the full containment of SCP-3787-n and any related anomalies is not believed to be possible at this time due to their widespread nature. Foundation efforts are to be directed towards reducing any public knowledge of SCP-3787-n.
