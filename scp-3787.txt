+++ SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES [{{OUTDATED}}]
----
[[div class="justified"]]
Foundation personnel within the Parazoology Division currently operate in various tiers of the U.S. equine industry. This measure exists to ensure:

# That horse breeding continues as a controlled element.
# That further progression of the anomaly can be mitigated.

Analysts are to track domesticated horse populations for anomalous behaviours such as uncharacteristic or unprovoked aggression, deviance from feeding habits, and deviance from natural breeding cycles. Known feral horse populations are to be monitored for abnormal activity. 

To ensure no deviance to the well-being of baseline horses, personnel are to avoid sterilization efforts within current populations and any restrictive actions taken to manage overpopulation. Instead, personnel are to disperse hormonal agent 762988-16-7 within horse populations. 762988-16-7 targets horse endocrine systems to promote docility and extend breeding cycles.

No known means of containing SCP-3787-ε exist at present. The Site-82 Operations Command Office, however, is accepting containment initiatives.

KETER-Class remains the classification of this anomaly until satisfactory levels of containment are met.

**Description:** SCP-3787 is a deviance to the natural behaviour of domesticated and free-roaming horse (//Equus ferus caballus//) populations in the Southern and Southwestern United States.

SCP-3787 manifests as a gestation period 8–10 times more rapid than the baseline horse-breeding cycle. Within affected mares, the baseline gestation period of 11–12 months shortens to 30–45 days from conception to birth. As a result, up to 10 times as many foals are born. Growth rates of this size are unsustainable and constitute a significant risk to the equine industry's ability to maintain control.

This breeding cycle does not adversely affect pregnant mares or resultant newborn foals. Newborn foals exhibit physiological properties similar to their non-anomalous counterparts. Foals also develop within pregnant mares despite lacking the necessary sustenance over the accelerated developmental period.

**SCP-3787-1** is an anomalous increase in horse aggression in free-roaming horse populations. Examples of aggression include:

* Unprovoked hostilities toward horses outside a constituent pack.
* The active killing of most or all members of a feral horse pack by that pack's dominant stallion.
* The cannibalization of foals as a show of dominance.

Increase in horse hostility has also extended into normal horse feeding patterns. Feral horse packs affected by this anomaly perform organized attacks on other wildlife, escalating to a point in which affected horses ignore herbivorous feeding habits. These attacks occur even though horse jaw structures and digestive systems are biologically unsuited for meat consumption. This manner of aggression has contributed to the advancement of horses to the top of the food chain in many areas.

SCP-3787-1 began in newborn foals affected by SCP-3787. It has since transferred to an unknown number of horse populations of various ages, according to a geometric infection model. In addition, this anomaly has developed in the same period and area as a memetic form of equinophobia,[[footnote]]**Equinophobia:** The fear of horses.[[/footnote]] designated SCP-3787-ε. 

**SCP-3787-ε** is an intense fear of horses within humans with no previous basis to do so. Researchers hypothesize SCP-3787-ε manifested because of a marked increase of horse population numbers, which caused an increase of equine concepts in the human consciousness. Persons may be unaware they have been affected by this anomaly until their re-exposure to the concept of horses through forms of media or personal conversations that reference horses.

SCP-3787-ε occurs in suburban areas, urban centres, and within populations far from rural communities. More specifically, SCP-3787-ε occurs within populations with little access to the equine.[[footnote]]Domesticated stud farms are an example of a resource unreachable to populations in these kinds of communities. Populations interested in thoroughbred horseracing remain unaffected.[[/footnote]]

An estimated 750 000 persons within the continental United States have contracted this anomaly.

+++ SCP-3787 UPDATE
----
[[/div]]

On 30 June 2021, Foundation efforts to reduce the heightened equine birth rate were successful. The median horse gestation period levelled out to ~1.5 times the baseline. In the 2 months since detecting the anomaly, more than 450 000 new horses were born in the United States alone.

On 12 July, Parazoology Division personnel observed what they hypothesized was an anomalous illness spreading throughout domesticated horse populations. Horses affected by this illness experienced a period of acute stress and entered a comatose state. In 18% of instances, affected horses later expired. An estimated 37% of horses in the Southern and Southwestern United States have been afflicted with this illness.

As of 29 August, research efforts into a vaccine have proved ineffective.

+++ PROJECT: DIRE HORSE

The accelerated spread of this illness has caused the death of ~1.1 million horses in the United States. In response, Site-82 -- in conjunction with the Scientific Department -- has published two reports on Project: DIRE HORSE to the IntSCPFN network.

+++ SUMMARY OF PROJECT: DIRE HORSE
----
[[div class="justified"]]
[[f>image http://scp-ru.wdfiles.com/local--files/list-of-foundation-s-internal-departments/sd.png style="width: 8em;"]]

Project: DIRE HORSE outlines the production of a significant horse population and the dissemination of this new population across the United States. This is to be conducted to mitigate the ongoing loss of horse populations and produce a phenotype resistant to the effects of the anomalous illness. 

To achieve this goal, DIRE HORSE has employed the use of Ashleigh's Fields: A cattle farm in Newton News, Montana. Ashleigh's Fields has been working under the Foundation front company Stratford Cattle Productions since 2010. Ashleigh's Fields uses an industrial farming facility responsible for the mass production of synthetic livestock in place of modern farming techniques.

[[include :scp-sandbox-3:image-zoom
|name=http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-3787/factory-farm.jpg
|caption=Ashleigh's Fields factory farm (hover to enlarge).]]

DIRE HORSE will use the Rimmer–Lister Hippological Simulacrum (or RLHS) prototype. The RLHS can produce 500 artificially grown adult horses (or 1 000 foals) per 6-hr period, within 99.91% genetic similarity of their natural counterparts. Horses produced by the RLHS undergo behavioural engineering and memetic hardening to reduce the potential effects of an SCP-3787-1 spread into its population.

In a runaway equine extinction event, the RLHS and its sentinel facility at Ashleigh's Fields can store up to 100 000 stable horses in cryogenic storage for up to a decade. 

To reduce general awareness of the full spread of the equine illness, DIRE HORSE is to promptly begin replacing horse populations in 35 U.S. states. Any expired horses affected by SCP-3787 are to be collected and transported to Site-41 Mnestic Production Facility-//Aleph// for decommissioning.

To prevent environmental contamination, expired SCP-3787-affected horses are undergoing decommissioning, detailed as follows.

# A network of Foundation web crawlers is to conduct mass media blackouts by purging any verified news reports on SCP-3787.
# Foundation personnel planted in the U.S. equine industry are to track all areas affected by mass die-offs. Expired horses identified during this process are to be removed from affected areas on an immediate basis and transported to Site-41, Facility-//Aleph//, for neutralization. 
# A randomized pool of 1 500 expired horses is to be stored for future testing.

Neutralization efforts will operate with the end goal of destroying all expired horses affected by SCP-3787.

[[/div]]

Foundation personnel specializing in antimemetics training have noted the emergence of large numbers of antimemetic equine entities. These entities, designated 3787-//N//, appear //en masse// as a direct result of extended Foundation efforts to control U.S. horse population numbers. (**ARCHIVIST'S NOTE:** This conclusion was derived based on the short time span between the conclusion of Project: DIRE HORSE and 3787-//N// appearances near common horse populations.)

A comprehensive description of these entities is as follows.

[[div class="blockquote"]]
[[div class="centered"]]
[[collapsible show="▷ Description of 3787-N ◁" hide="△ Close △"]]
[[/div]]
----
+++ 3787-//N// DESCRIPTION
----
[[<]]
**3787-//N//** is a collective of predatory, semi-humanoid equine entities. Each 3787-//N// instance is composed of malleable cartilage integrated with groupings of musculature typical of horses. One defining feature is its horse-like cranium, which consists of a muzzle capable of equine vocalizations. Naturally occurring braided horsehair is present in the form of a mane and tail. Each strand of hair is autonomous; 3787-//N// efforts to control hair movement often appear laboured, and seem unsuccessful.

Though 3787-//N// possesses dull, rounded teeth, it has been observed to engage in carnivorous activities and consume humans -- albeit rarely. Despite this, it does not feed for sustenance; instances instead choose to hunt for recreation.

All 3787-//N// appendages are capable of contorting, elongating, and wrapping around themselves. In acts of defence, 3787-//N// will balloon its body outward. Instances will also mount one another, combining in tandem with the formation of wheel-like anatomical structures to use their collective body mass as a moving vehicle. When this occurs, velocities of up to 150 km/hr have been observed.

Sightings of 3787-//N// occur in nocturnal settings. 3787-//N// is a pack predator, appearing in groups ranging between five and 50 instances. These groups typically manifest near domestic or thoroughbred horse farms and feral horse packs.

3787-//N// display a strong revulsion to most forms of visible light and experience physical damage on exposure. The Task Forces Commander at Site-82 advises any personnel in the vicinity of 3787-//N// instances to carry any form of light-based weaponry available.

No other means of damaging 3787-//N// have been observed at present.
[[/<]]
[[/collapsible]]
[[/div]]

Containment analysts at Site-82 have come to infer a complex relationship among the appearances of 3787-//N// and previous equine anomalies. Analysts conclude that the emergence of increased equine aggression and accelerated birth rates was, in part, a widespread anomalous defence mechanism tailored toward the repulsion of 3787-//N//. 

Current reports show that this behaviour has almost reversed, in part because of the emergence and influence of 3787-//N// -- which horses now act subservient toward.

Research Director Elliot Alces has approved the reclassification of SCP-3787 to an ARCHON-Class anomaly.[[footnote]]**ARCHON-Class:** Designates anomalies that can be contained but ought not to, because of the damage that would be caused by doing so.[[/footnote]] The Foundation is presently undergoing wide-scale internal research efforts focused on the anomalous nature of horses as a species.

Since the appearance of 3787-//N//, horses in the United States have deviated from their typical behaviour.[[footnote]]Horses produced by Project: DIRE HORSE have not deviated from their designed behaviour.[[/footnote]] Almost all observed horse populations display SCP-3787-1 and attack humans, causing civilian casualties beyond Foundation control. In areas with a significant volume of horses displaying SCP-3787-1, domesticated and feral horses alike have begun a mass transit to an as-yet unconfirmed area in the American Southwest, led by groups of 3787-//N//. 

How the two groups communicate is currently under active investigation.

3787-//N// have directed efforts toward constructing a large equine-centric locale composed of both horses and 3787-//N// populations. Contact by any non-equine populations has led to confrontational behaviour on the part of 3787-//N//. 

Foundation personnel managing the effects of SCP-3787 also face aggression. In some instances, personnel have undergone bodily transfiguration into horses via inexplicable means.

----
++ ADDENDUM 3787.5
+++ FURTHER ACTIONS TAKEN
----
[[/div]]

Mobile Task Force Pi-5 ("Glue Factory") has formed to repel the attacks of 3787-//N//. Each member of Pi-5 is trained to deal with antimemetic anomalies and is assigned a strict Class-W Mnestic prescription.

A summary of Pi-5, Alpha Platoon, is as follows.

* Forty combat operatives with light-based weaponry such as the 1 000-watt N-62A Laser Optics Pistol, the 2 000-watt G1A Tactical Solid-state Laser Rifle, and the prototype 30 000-watt Basov-Prokhorov RX-7Z Hard-Light Heavy Rifle ("Nulltaker").
* 4,000-lumen flashlights and interfaces with night vision and blue-light eye protection lenses.
* Fifteen Polaris MV800 All-Terrain Vehicles outfitted with Light Reconnaissance Laser Optic gun platforms.
* Ten Chenowth Utility Terrain Vehicles.
* Four SL/SX Support Drones fitted with Mariotte-Pashler antimemetic perception filters.

Despite Pi-5's formation, the full containment of 3787-//N// and any related anomalies is not yet possible because of their widespread nature. 

The Foundation is currently directing efforts toward reducing [[[scp-4466|the fear of horses.]]]
