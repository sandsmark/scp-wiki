**Description:** SCP-3787 describes a deviance to the natural behaviour of domesticated and free-roaming horse (//Equus ferus caballus//) populations in the Southern and Southwestern United States.

SCP-3787 refers to the emergence of a gestation period 8–10 times more rapid than the baseline horse-breeding cycle. The baseline gestation period of 11–12 months is shortened to roughly 30–45 days -- from conception to birth -- among affected horses. Up to 10 times as many foals are born as a result. Growth rates of this size over an extended period of time are unsustainable and pose a serious risk to the equine industry's ability to maintain it. 

Horses involved in this breeding cycle -- including both newborn foals and pregnant mares -- are not negatively affected; newborn foals exhibit physiological properties similar in nature to their non-anomalous counterparts. They develop within pregnant mares despite lacking the necessary sustenance over the accelerated developmental period.

SCP-3787-1 describes an anomalous increase in horse aggression in free-roaming horse populations. Examples of aggression include:

* Unprovoked hostilities toward horses outside a constituent pack; 
* The active killing of most or all members of a feral horse pack by that pack's dominant stallion; and,
* The cannibalization of foals as a show of dominance.[[footnote]][[span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; color: #b01;"]]Document 3787.0031[[/span]] contains a full list of observed hunting behaviour.[[/footnote]]

Increase in horse hostility has extended into normal horse feeding patterns as well. Feral horse packs affected by this anomaly carry out organized attacks on other wildlife, escalating to the point of ignoring herbivorous feeding habits. This occurs despite horse jaw structures and digestive systems being biologically unsuited for meat consumption. This manner of aggression has led to the progression of horses to the top of the food chain in many areas.

SCP-3787-1 initially began in newborn foals affected by SCP-3787 but has since transferred to an unknown number of horse populations of varying ages based on a geometric infection model. As well, this anomaly has developed in the same time frame and area as a second equine anomaly, designated  SCP-3787-ε. This anomaly refers to the immediate consequences of a marked increase of total horse populations, which has led to the increase of the equine in the human consciousness.

SCP-3787-ε is the designation given to an anomalous memetic form of equinophobia, or the emergence of an intense fear of horses among humans with no previous basis to fear horses. Persons may not be aware that they have been affected by this anomaly until they have been re-exposed to the concept of horses through forms of media or personal conversations that reference horses.

SCP-3787-ε occurs in suburban areas and urban centres, and among populations far from rural communities. More specifically, SCP-3787-ε occurs among populations with little access to that which is equine in nature.[[footnote]]Domesticated stud farms are an example of a resource unreachable to populations in these kinds of communities, though it can be noted that populations immediately interested in thoroughbred horse racing have not been affected.[[/footnote]] Persons within these populations with a fascination for horses on any level are not affected by this anomaly. 

An estimated 750,000 persons within the continental United States alone have contracted this anomaly.

On June 30, 2021, Foundation efforts to reduce the heightened equine birth rate were deemed successful. The median horse gestation period levelled out to ~1.5 times the baseline. In the two months since detecting the anomaly, ~450,000 new horses were born in the United States alone.

On July 12, Zoology Department personnel observed what they hypothesized to be an anomalous illness spreading throughout domesticated horse populations. Horses affected by this illness experienced a period of extreme stress, leaving them in a comatose state. In 18% of cases, affected horses later expired. 37% of horses in the Southern and Southwestern United States have been afflicted with this illness.

Research efforts into a cure have, as of July 29, proven ineffective.

Since it began, the accelerated spread of this illness has led to the death of ~1.1 million horses in the US alone. In response, Site-82 -- in conjunction with the Scientific Department -- published the following reports on Project: DIRE HORSE to the IntSCPFN network.

+++ Summary of Project: DIRE HORSE
[[/=]]

[[<]]
Project: DIRE HORSE outlines the production of a significant horse population and the dissemination of this new population across the United States. This is to be done to mitigate the ongoing loss of horse populations and to produce a phenotype resistant to the effects of the anomalous illness. 

To achieve this goal, DIRE HORSE has employed the use of Ashleigh's Fields, a cattle farm in Newton News, Montana, which has been operating under the Foundation front company Stratford Cattle Productions since 2010. Ashleigh's Fields uses an industrial farming facility responsible for the mass production of synthetic livestock in the place of modern farming techniques.

[[include :scp-sandbox-3:image-zoom name=http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-3787/factory-farm.jpg|caption=Ashleigh's Fields factory farm.|width=300px|align=right]]

DIRE HORSE makes use of the Rimmer-Lister Hippological Simulacrum (or RLHS) prototype. The RLHS is capable of producing 500 artificially grown adult horses (or 1,000 foals) per hour, within 99.91% genetic similarity of their natural counterparts. Horses produced by the RLHS are behaviourally engineered and memetically hardened to reduce the potential effects of an SCP-3787-1 spread into its population. 

In the event of a runaway equine extinction, the RLHS and its sentinel facility at Ashleigh's Fields are capable of storing up to 100,000 stable horses in cryogenic storage for a period of up to 10 years. 

To reduce public awareness of the full extent of the spread of the equine illness, DIRE HORSE is to immediately begin replacing horse populations in 35 different states. Any expired horses having been affected by SCP-3787 in any capacity are to be collected and sent to Site-41 Mnestic Production Facility "Aleph" for decommissioning purposes.

To prevent environmental contamination, expired SCP-3787-affected horses are tagged and collected for decommissioning purposes. The nature of this decommissioning is as follows:

# Mass media blackouts are carried out by a network of Foundation web crawlers by purging any uncontained news reports on SCP-3787.
# All areas affected by mass die-offs are tracked by Foundation personnel planted in the North American equine industry.
# Expired horses identified during this process are removed from affected areas on an immediate basis and taken to Site-41 facility "Aleph" for neutralization. 
# A random pool of 1,500 expired horses is stored for future testing.

Neutralization efforts will operate with the end goal of destroying all expired horses affected by SCP-3787. Per __Procedure MNEMOSYNE__, destroyed subjects are to be broken down into multi-component slurry to begin the transformation into Class-W Mnestics material, as a primary component of modern mnestics is an admixture of various parts of horse anatomy.[[footnote]]See //Understanding Antimemetics, First Edition// by Drs L. Marness & G. Yarrow, published in 1976.[[/footnote]]

Foundation personnel specializing in antimemetics training note the emergence of large numbers of 3787-N instances. These entities appear //en masse// as a direct result of extended Foundation efforts to control North American horse population numbers.[[footnote]]The conclusion reached based on the short time span between Project: DIRE HORSE and the discovery of 3787-N, as well as their appearances near common horse populations.[[/footnote]]

A full description of 3787-N is as follows.

= **3787-N DESCRIPTION**
----
[[<]]
3787-N designates a collective of predatory, intelligent, semi-humanoid equine entities. 3787-N are composed of a malleable cartilage structure integrated with groupings of musculature typical of horses.

One of 3787-N's defining features is their horse-like craniums, which consist of a muzzle from which equine vocalizations are possible. Naturally occurring braided horsehair is visible in the form of a mane and a tail. Each individual strand of hair is autonomous, despite 3787-N efforts to remain static in their positioning. 

While 3787-N possess dull, rounded teeth, they engage in carnivorous activities and are observed to consume humans. Despite this, 3787-N do not feed for sustenance, and instead, choose to hunt for recreational purposes.

3787-N attack in a manner solely involving their bodies, or in conjunction with other instances as a group. All 3787-N appendages are capable of being contorted, elongated, and wrapped around themselves. For example, 3787-N balloon their bodies as a form of defence. Individual instances have been observed mounting one another, combining in tandem with the formation of wheel-like anatomical structures. This is achieved to use their collective body masses as vehicles for transportation. When this occurs, velocities of up to 150 km/h have been observed.

3787-N sightings have almost always occurred in nocturnal settings. 3787-N are pack predators, appearing in groups ranging between 5–500 instances, typically manifesting near domestic or thoroughbred horse farms and feral horse packs.

3787-N have a strong revulsion toward most forms of visible light, to the point of experiencing physical damage upon exposure. Personnel attempting contact with 3787-N are advised to carry any forms of light-based weaponry available, ranging from LED spotlights to hard light weaponry prototypes. 

No other means of damaging 3787-N exist.
[[/<]]
[[/collapsible]]
[[/div]]

Containment analysts at Site-82 have come to understand a complex relationship between the appearance of 3787-N and previous equine anomalies. Analysts conclude that the emergence of increased equine aggression and accelerated birth rates was, in part, a widespread anomalous defence mechanism tailored toward the repulsion of 3787-N. Current reports have shown that this behaviour has almost reversed, in due part of the emergence and influence of 3787-N, which they act subservient toward.

Research Director Elliot Alces has approved the reclassification of SCP-3787 to an Archon-Class anomaly.[[footnote]]Archon-Class items are anomalies that are able to be contained but ought not to be, due to the damage that would be caused by doing so.[[/footnote]] The Foundation is now undergoing wide-scale internal research efforts focused on the anomalous nature of horses as a species.

Since the appearance of 3787-N, North American horses have deviated from their normal behaviour.[[footnote]]Horses produced as a result of Project: DIRE HORSE have not deviated from their standard behaviour.[[/footnote]] Almost all observed horse populations display SCP-3787-1 and attack humans, leading to civilian casualties beyond Foundation control. In areas with a high volume of SCP-3787-1, domesticated and feral horses alike have begun a mass pilgrimage to a yet undesignated area in the American Southwest, led by groups of 3787-N. 

How the two groups communicate is currently under active investigation.

3787-N have directed efforts toward constructing a large equine-centric locale composed of both horses and 3787-N populations. Attempted contact by any non-equine populations has led to confrontative behaviour on the part of 3787-N. Foundation personnel attempting to hinder the effects of SCP-3787 also face aggression, and in some cases, have transformed into horses via unknown means.

Mobile Task Force Pi-5 ("Glue Factory") has formed to repel the attacks of 3787-N. Each member of Pi-5 is trained to deal with antimemetic anomalies, and is to remain on a strict Class-W mnestic prescription. A summary of the task force is as follows:

* 40 combat operatives using light-based weaponry such as the 1000W N-62A Laser Optics Pistol, the 2000W G1A Tactical Solid-state Laser Rifle, and the prototype 30,000W Basok-Prokhorov RX-7Z Hard Light Heavy Rifle ("Nulltaker");
* 4000 lm flashlights and interfaces with night vision and blue-light eye protection lenses;
* 15 Polaris MV800 ATV medium support vehicles outfitted with Light Reconnaissance Laser Optics (LaLo) gun platforms;
* 10 Chenoweth RAV light action support vehicles; and,
* 4 SL/SX Support Drones fitted with Mariotte-Pashler antimemetic perception filters.

Despite Pi-5's formation, the full containment of 3787-N and any related anomalies is not believed to be possible due to their widespread nature. 

Foundation efforts are currently directed toward reducing any public fear of 3787-N.
