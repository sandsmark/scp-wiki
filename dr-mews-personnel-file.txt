 [[*user Attila the Pun]] is the co-author! They offered to co-author it with me when I was desperate to fix up the original piece of shit hogging the spot. So, we fixed it up together! Attila and I both worked very hard and I think we’ve got a nice piece there!

WAAAAAY different from the original concept, but I like this one a lot more! There was a point where it was sitting as a kinda mediocre draft with little critique, so I pmed [[*user Zyn]] to review it. After talking back and forth a few times, she offered to co-author it and implement her ideas. What we have now is a nice, wholesome SCP about dinosaur fossils!

My favorite SCP types and concepts to read and write -

* Insects
* Technology (especially  internet)
* Television/music
* Math (despite the fact I’m abysmal at it)
* Concepts that shouldn’t work but do (i.e. 503 yes I know that one’s old)
* GOI’s (especially GAW, Eric, WWS, And Wondertainment)
* Ideas that provoke emotion (i.e. 3999)
* Weird shit ,, well written weird shit(again, 3999)
* Wholesome shit ,, just that stuff that fills my heart (i.e. 2295)
* Historically based SCPs (especially ones with themes of any time period from the 20th century)

If you’ve got any ideas that fit this criteria that you need reviewing/potential greenlighting feel free to shoot me a pm or catch me on IRC

IRC Name(s) -

Site 19 - Mew-ltiverse

The Critters - Mew/Mewltiverse

I have two different hook ups for those chats if you wanna know how the hell that happened feel free to ask I think I know it’s a funny story

Here are my reoccurring/hoping to have reoccur characters profiles. I’ve been wanting to make them for a while, and I finally got off my ass and did it, aha.

Feel free to use any of them in a tale or SCP! Just let me know in advance, please. :)

[[Tabview]]
[[tab Researcher Crane]]

**Name:** Researcher Oliver Crane

**Clearance Level:** Level 4

**Specialties:** Technology expert, visually triggered cognitohazards, vocal exploration leader

**Location:** Primarily Site 288, occasionally other sites when needed.

**History:** Researcher Crane was born completely blind, which was proven useful in research of visually activated cognitohazards. Before joining the Foundation, Researcher Crane had a job as a Computer & Information Research Scientist. He excelled at the job, knowing far more about coding and software engineering then required. Researcher Crane developed his own touch to hear technology in the form of a glove and Bluetooth ear piece  to aid him around daily life.

Researcher Crane grew up in Airdrie, Scotland. He lacked an ideal upbringing, undergoing severe emotional and physical abuse by his father daily. The trauma of his past affects him to this day, as he developed Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Researcher Crane has biweekly therapy sessions with Dr. Johnson.

Researcher Crane is often accompanied by Dr. Stanley Diamond when off site, due to the two’s friendship.

[[tab Dr. Juniper Marigold]]
**Name:** Dr. Juniper “Marigold” Daisy

**Clearance Level:** Level 3

**Profession:** Microbiology researcher, sapient anomalies specialist

**Location:** Site 23, Site 43

**Profile:** Dr. Marigold communicates somewhat stoically, keeping a monotone voice, and expressionless face. Despite this, her individuality still shines through in her mannerisms such as: sitting on the floor opposed to a chair as much as possible, constantly moving one of her limbs (eg: leg, arm, hand, or rocking back and forth), being incredibly blunt, not realizing when things she says are out of place, and extreme love of animals with more than four limbs (which shows). Dr. Marigold enjoys watching the fish tank in her office, reading books, judging other people’s decisions, and interacting with safe class anomalies.

//Note: It is speculated that Dr. Marigold falls somewhere on the Autism spectrum. - Dr. Hart//

**History:** Dr. Marigold has been working for the Foundation every since she received her masters degree in microbiology. She became aware and interested in the position due to her mother’s job as a Foundation researcher.

After two years of working with her mother, incident █████-████ occurred, ending in her mother’s termination. Although Dr. Marigold was not involved, she still felt it was her job to take her mother’s place. She took up working with sapient anomalies, and is now where she is today.
[[/tab]]
[[tab Dr. Kenny Hart]]

**Name:** Dr. Kenneth Hart

**Clearance Level:** Level 4

**Occupation:** Site Psychologist

**Specialties:** Personnel recovery following interactions with emotionally stressing anomalies

**Location:** Site 23, Site 288

**Profile:** Dr. Hart is a man who prefers to keep to himself. He doesn’t often express his emotions, and has only [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4412 | one]]] close friend. Despite this, his work as a psychologist has remained unaffected.
[[/tab]]

[[tab Dr. Stanley Diamond]]

**Name:** Dr. Stanley Diamond

**Clearance Level:** Level 3

**Occupation:** Geologist

**Specialties:** Archeological anomalies, geological anomalies

**Location:** Site 288, wherever needed

**History:** Dr. Diamond was head researcher of SCP-████, and involved in Incident SCP-████. In result of the incident, Dr. Diamond received a facial wound.

**Profile:** Dr. Diamond has been described by others as “an egotistical, selfish asshole” around anyone who is not Researcher Oliver Crane. Dr. Diamond has developed a somewhat protective nature for Researcher Crane, accompanying him on offsite missions, as well as emotionally stressing ones.
