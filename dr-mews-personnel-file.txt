 [[*user Attila the Pun]] is the co-author! They offered to co-author it with me when I was desperate to fix up the original piece of shit hogging the spot. So, we fixed it up together! Attila and I both worked very hard and I think we’ve got a nice piece there!

WAAAAAY different from the original concept, but I like this one a lot more! There was a point where it was sitting as a kinda mediocre draft with little critique, so I pmed [[*user Zyn]] to review it. After talking back and forth a few times, she offered to co-author it and implement her ideas. What we have now is a nice, wholesome SCP about dinosaur fossils!

My favorite SCP types and concepts to read and write -

* Insects
* Technology (especially  internet)
* Television/music
* Math (despite the fact I’m abysmal at it)
* Concepts that shouldn’t work but do (i.e. 503 yes I know that one’s old)
* GOI’s (especially GAW, Eric, WWS, And Wondertainment)
* Ideas that provoke emotion (i.e. 3999)
* Weird shit ,, well written weird shit(again, 3999)
* Wholesome shit ,, just that stuff that fills my heart (i.e. 2295)
* Historically based SCPs (especially ones with themes of any time period from the 20th century)

If you’ve got any ideas that fit this criteria that you need reviewing/potential greenlighting feel free to shoot me a pm or catch me on IRC
