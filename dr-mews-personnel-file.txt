[[[SCP-4412 | SCP-4412 -- What Could Have Been?]]] - [[*user Attila the Pun]] is the co-author! They offered to co-author it with me when I was desperate to fix up the original piece of shit hogging the spot. So, we fixed it up together! Attila and I both worked very hard and I think we’ve got a nice piece there!

[[[SCP-4846 | SCP-4846 -- Friendly Fossils]]] - WAAAAAY different from the original concept, but I like this one a lot more! There was a point where it was sitting as a kinda mediocre draft with little critique, so I pmed [[*user Zyn]] to review it. After talking back and forth a few times, she offered to co-author it and implement her ideas. What we have now is a nice, wholesome SCP about dinosaur fossils!
@@ @@
[[[SCP-4939 | SCP-4939 -- The Man on the Moon]]] - So this was something I'd been working on for a bit. I'm not too happy with the final result, but I wanted to get it out there. I strongly relate to Dr. Rivas, as I struggle with OCD myself.

[[[SCP-4482 | SCP-4482 -- Last Call]]] - Me and Tanhony’s collab! I think it’s pretty cool! It’s not a concept for everyone, but I still like how it turned out!

[[[SCP-4795 | SCP-4795 -- Feathered F(r)iends]]] - This was a collab between me and [[*user Lt Flops]]. Phoenix was very pleasant to work with. This was super fun to write! I actually wrote good dialogue and I’m so happy! ;; Team Bird Best Team!

[[[SCP-4542 | SCP-4542 -- Bug Bunnies]]] - Me and [[*user DrAkimoto]] purged through many ideas, but eventually this is what we went with! The journals went through three revisions, but it was worth it aha. This was fun to write, and Akimoto was great to work with!

[[[SCP-4648 | SCP-4648 -- Regaining Sight]]] -- This was like, my very first greenlighted concept when I still needed greenlights. It's changed //a lot// since. I like the turn out; it wasn't received the best, but I like it so I think that's what counts.

My favourite SCP types and concepts to read and write -

* Insects
* Technology
* Internet/Online
* Television/music
* Phenomenons
* Infohazards
* Memetics
* Math (despite the fact I’m abysmal at it)
* Concepts that shouldn’t work but do (i.e. 503 yes I know that one’s old)
* GOI’s (especially GAW, Eric, WWS, And Wondertainment)
* Ideas that provoke emotion (i.e. 3999)
* Weird shit ,, well written weird shit(again, 3999)
* Wholesome shit ,, just that stuff that fills my heart (i.e. 2295)
* Historically based SCPs (especially ones with themes of any time period from the 20th century)
* Creative ways to implement the idea of a personnel member becoming an anomaly
* Personnel-focused SCPs

If you’ve got any ideas that fit these criteria that you need reviewing/potential greenlighting feel free to shoot me a pm or catch me on IRC

IRC Name(s) -

Here are my reoccurring/hoping to have reoccurred characters profiles. I’ve been wanting to make them for a while, and I finally got off my ass and did it, aha.

Feel free to use any of them in a tale or SCP! Just let me know in advance, please. :)

[[Tabview]]
[[tab Researcher Oliver Crane]]

**Name:** Researcher Oliver Crane

**Clearance Level:** Level 4

**Specialties:** Anomalous technology specialist, technological expert, visually triggered cognitohazards, vocal exploration leader

**Location:** Primarily Site 288, Site 23, occasionally other sites when needed.

**History:** Researcher Crane was born completely blind, which was proven useful in research of visually activated cognitohazards. Before joining the Foundation, Researcher Crane had a job as a Computer & Information Research Scientist. He excelled at the job, knowing far more about coding and software engineering then required. Researcher Crane developed his own touch to hear technology in the form of a glove and Bluetooth earpiece to aid him around daily life.

Researcher Crane grew up in Airdrie, Scotland. He lacked an ideal upbringing, undergoing severe emotional and physical abuse by his father daily. The trauma of his past affects him to this day, as he developed Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Researcher Crane has biweekly therapy sessions with Dr. Johnson.

Researcher Crane is often accompanied by Dr. Stanley Diamond when off-site, due to the two’s friendship.

[[/tab]]
[[tab Dr. Juniper Marigold]]
**Name:** Dr. Juniper “Marigold” Daisy

**Clearance Level:** Level 4

**Profession:** Microbiology researcher, sapient anomalies specialist

**Location:** Site 23, Site 43

**Profile:** Dr. Marigold communicates somewhat stoically, keeping a monotone voice, an expressionless face. Despite this, her individuality still shines through in her mannerisms such as: sitting on the floor opposed to a chair as much as possible, constantly moving one of her limbs (eg: leg, arm, hand, or rocking back and forth), being incredibly blunt, not realizing when things she says are out of place, and extreme love of animals with more than four limbs (which shows). Dr. Marigold enjoys watching the fish tank in her office, reading books, judging other people’s decisions, and interacting with safe class anomalies.

**History:** Dr. Marigold has been working for the Foundation every since she received her master's degree in microbiology. She became aware and interested in the position due to her mother’s job as a Foundation researcher.

After two years of working with her mother, incident █████-████ occurred, ending in her mother’s termination. Although Dr. Marigold was not involved, she still felt it was her job to take her mother’s place. She took up working with sapient anomalies and is now where she is today.
[[/tab]]
[[tab Dr. Kenny Hart]]

**Name:** Dr. Kenneth Hart

**Clearance Level:** Level 4

**Occupation:** Site Psychologist

**Specialties:** Personnel recovery following interactions with emotionally stressing anomalies

**Location:** Site 23, Site 288

**Profile:** Dr. Hart is a man who prefers to keep to himself. He doesn’t often express his emotions and has only [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4412 | one]]] close friend. Despite this, his work as a psychologist has remained unaffected.

Dr. Hart has a past with getting into physical fights, and winning by a landslide. It's not a part of himself he prefers to share.

[Author’s Note: Dr. Hart and Researcher Gates are dating, but have not and do not plan to inform the Foundation of this.]

[Author’s Note #2: Dr. Hart is //incredibly// easy to anger, especially if Researcher Gates is insulted around him. He’s been working on it, but he has a bit of a lack on impulse control.]
[[/tab]]

[[tab Dr. Stanley Diamond]]

**Name:** Dr. Stanley Diamond

**Clearance Level:** Level 3

**Occupation:** Geologist

**Specialties:** Archeological anomalies, geological anomalies

**Location:** Site 288, Site 23, wherever needed

**History:** Dr. Diamond was the head researcher of SCP-████, and involved in Incident SCP-████. In result of the incident, Dr. Diamond received a facial wound.

Dr. Diamond’s mother was murdered by his uncle when he was five years old. Although he dislikes the details, the exact situation was traumatic, ever changing how he viewed the world, and the people in it.

**Profile:** Dr. Diamond has been described by others as “an egotistical, selfish asshole” around anyone who is not Researcher Oliver Crane. Dr. Diamond has developed a somewhat protective nature for Researcher Crane, accompanying him on offsite missions, as well as emotionally stressing ones.

[Author’s Note: Dr. Diamond has PTSD and Borderline Personality Disorder, but has refuted the diagnoses, despite being diagnosed twice by two different doctors.]

[[/tab]]
[[tab Researcher Kevin R. Gates]]
**Name:** Kevin R. Gates

**Clearance Level:** Level 2

**Occupation:** Semi-retired Mechanical Engineer

**Profile:** After his interaction with [[[*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4412 | SCP-4412]]], Researcher Gates has not worked with many anomalies due to decline in mental health.

Researcher Gates can still work with anomalies when accompanied by Dr. Hart

[[/tab]]
[[/Tabview]]

And a short list of my not as prominent characters (that I hope to use more!):

**Junior Researcher Quinn Whyte:** A depressed relatively new foundation employee who hates his job and hopes to do something great one day.

**Dr. Marvin Waters:** Researcher Whyte's boss. A generally nice guy who mostly does office work due to a permanent leg injury.

**Dr. Dolly Dickson:** A sweet southern girl who specializes in phenomena. [[[*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4482 | Star Villa's]]] girlfriend.

**Agent Micheal "Oreo" O'Riley:** An agent who likes to get right to the point. Not good with humor, but is okay with the nickname.

**Dr. Mark Good:** Pathologist, took Senior Researcher McNamara's position after he [[[*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4846 | retired]]].

**Dr. April Perry:** Likes to handle the dirty work on the field, works with Dr. Good and Dr. Nelly Flowers.

**Dr. Nelly Flowers/"Dr. Flo":** Works with stubborn sapient anomalies and dangerous sapient anomalies. Dating Dr. Jessica Thompson.

**Dr. Jessica Thompson:** Does a lot of desk work and interviews. Dating Dr. Nelly Flowers.

**--Dr.-- Agent Epon Scarlett:** An egotistical, delusional reality bender.  The Foundation is still trying to catch him.

**Prof. Elizabeth Wilbert:** Lead of Scarlett's case, dealt with his bullshit before he was fired, and still deals with it now.
