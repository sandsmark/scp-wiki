This is to be expected. Dr. Mew is a very normal and boring foundation employee. Except she is a cat. There is that.

Hi I’m Mew and I write shit and I’m slightly better at it than I was the last four months

------

+ **__Other Info and Stuff__**

My favourite SCP types and concepts to read and write -

* Insects
* Technology
* Internet/Online
* Television/music
* Phenomenons
* Infohazards
* Memetics
* Math (despite the fact I’m abysmal at it)
* Concepts that shouldn’t work but do (i.e. 503 yes I know that one’s old)
* GOI’s (especially AWCY, GAW, Eric, WWS, And Wondertainment)
* Ideas that provoke emotion (i.e. 3999)
* Weird shit ,, well written weird shit(again, 3999)
* Wholesome shit ,, just that stuff that fills my heart (i.e. 2295)
* Historically based SCPs (especially ones with themes of any time period from the 20th century)
* Creative ways to implement the idea of a personnel member becoming an anomaly
* Personnel-focused SCPs

++ __**Researcher Oliver Crane**__

**Name:** Researcher Oliver Crane

**Clearance Level:** Level 4

**Specialties:** Anomalous technology specialist, technological expert, visually triggered cognitohazards, vocal exploration leader

**Location:** Primarily Site 288, Site 23, occasionally other sites when needed.

**History:** Researcher Crane was born completely blind, which was proven useful in research of visually activated cognitohazards. Before joining the Foundation, Researcher Crane had a job as a Computer & Information Research Scientist. He excelled at the job, knowing far more about coding and software engineering then required. Researcher Crane developed his own touch to hear technology in the form of a glove and Bluetooth earpiece to aid him around daily life.

Researcher Crane grew up in Airdrie, Scotland. He lacked an ideal upbringing, undergoing severe emotional and physical abuse by his father daily. The trauma of his past affects him to this day, as he developed Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Researcher Crane has biweekly therapy sessions with Dr. Johnson.

Researcher Crane is often accompanied by Dr. Stanley Diamond when off-site, due to the two’s friendship.

> **Author Notes:**
> 
> There are a multitude of phrases, items, and a few places which are triggering to him. Most cause from minor anxiety to panic attacks and occasionally flashbacks upon mention or contact, although a few items such as ropes, belts, and metal forks and knives, and insults about his blindness almost always send him into flashbacks, as those things were all very prominent in his childhood trauma.
> 
> Dislikes when people look at his blindness as a disability
> 
> Seen as "the nice one" by many, but typically only keeps to himself to avoid argument. Will stand up for himself if he feels he’s being disrespected.
> 
> Crane often dissociates, which is the reason some of his spoken dialogue often has “stutters” in it. He’s pretty much dissociating at least 35-45% of a day, but is so used to it, he powers through.
> 
> Crane has very bad trust issues, as he was abused by his father, and his mother didn’t care, even lying for him if suspicions were raised.
> 
> Crane and Diamond are dating

++ __**Dr. Stanley Diamond**__

**Name:** Dr. Stanley Diamond

**Clearance Level:** Level 3

**Occupation:** Geologist

**Specialties:** Archeological anomalies, geological anomalies

**Location:** Site 288, Site 23, wherever needed

**History:** Dr. Diamond was the head researcher of SCP-████, and involved in Incident SCP-████. In result of the incident, Dr. Diamond received a facial wound.

Dr. Diamond’s mother was murdered by his uncle when he was five years old. Although he dislikes the details, the exact situation was traumatic, ever changing how he viewed the world, and the people in it.

**Profile:** Dr. Diamond has been described by others as “a selfish asshole” around anyone who is not Researcher Oliver Crane. Dr. Diamond has developed a somewhat protective nature for Researcher Crane, accompanying him on offsite missions, as well as emotionally stressing ones.

> **Author’s Notes:**
> 
> Diamond has PTSD and Borderline Personality Disorder, but has refuted the diagnoses, despite being diagnosed twice by two different doctors. He believes these diagnoses make him weak, but doesn’t think Crane’s CPTSD diagnosis makes him weak, revealing a double standard he’s sort of been raised to have.
> 
> After his mother was murdered, his father completely ignored her, and would get upset at Diamond for crying and mourning his mother’s death. His father wanted him to be strong and “manly” as he grew up, and wasn’t afraid to use physical punishment to get Diamond to obey him. His father was never the nicest man, and didn’t become nicer after the death of Delilah Diamond.

++ __**Dr. Juniper Marigold**__

**Name:** Dr. Juniper “Marigold” Daisy

**Clearance Level:** Level 4

**Profession:** Microbiology researcher, sapient anomalies specialist

**Location:** Site 23, Site 43

**Profile:** Dr. Marigold communicates somewhat stoically, keeping a monotone voice, an expressionless face. Despite this, her individuality still shines through in her mannerisms such as: sitting on the floor opposed to a chair as much as possible, constantly moving one of her limbs (eg: leg, arm, hand, or rocking back and forth), being incredibly blunt, not realizing when things she says are out of place, and extreme love of animals with more than four limbs (which shows). Dr. Marigold enjoys watching the fish tank in her office, reading books, judging other people’s decisions, and interacting with safe class anomalies.

**History:** Dr. Marigold has been working for the Foundation every since she received her master's degree in microbiology. She became aware and interested in the position due to her mother’s job as a Foundation researcher.

After two years of working with her mother, incident █████-████ occurred, ending in her mother’s termination. Although Dr. Marigold was not involved, she still felt it was her job to take her mother’s place. She took up working with sapient anomalies and is now where she is today.

> **Author Notes:**
> 
> Low functioning autistic
> 
> Followed her mother to work one day as a child and the amnestics didn't take full affect, revealing her resistance to amnestics; her resistance to memetics and cognitohazards was later discovered
> 
> Has two crabs named Leopold and Buttercream that were discovered in a pet store
> 
> Loves sea animals, especially crabs
> 
> Low-key angry at her mother, and strives to be better than her
> 
> Father never in the picture
>
> Ace Ace Baby (she’s asexual)

++ __**Dr. Kenny Hart**__

**Name:** Dr. Kenneth Hart

**Clearance Level:** Level 4

**Occupation:** Site Psychologist

**Specialties:** Personnel recovery following interactions with emotionally stressing anomalies

**Location:** Site 23, Site 288

**Profile:** Dr. Hart is a man who prefers to keep to himself. He doesn’t often express his emotions and has only [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4412 | one]]] close friend. Despite this, his work as a psychologist has remained unaffected.

Dr. Hart has a past with getting into physical fights, and winning by a landslide. It's not a part of himself he prefers to share.

> **Author Notes:**
> 
> Dr. Hart and Researcher Gates are dating, but have not and do not plan to inform the Foundation of this.
>
> Dr. Hart is //incredibly// easy to anger, especially if Researcher Gates is insulted around him. He’s been working on it, but he has a bit of a lack on impulse control.
> 
> Has intermittent explosive disorder and depression
> 
> Grew up in and out of juvenile detention and mental hospitals due to extreme anger issues
> 
> Has a dislike for "authority" but doesn't openly show this
> 
> Doesn't like using his full name "Kenneth" and prefers the nickname Kenny


++ __**Researcher Kevin R. Gates**__

**Name:** Kevin R. Gates

**Clearance Level:** Level 2

**Occupation:** Semi-retired Mechanical Engineer

**Profile:** After his interaction with [[[*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4412 | SCP-4412]]], Researcher Gates has not worked with many anomalies due to decline in mental health.

As Researcher Gates is a very talented engineer, efforts to re-introduce him to work with SCPs have been initiated, beginning with work with anomalous items (excluding those with mind-affecting properties of any kind).

> **Author’s Notes:**
> 
> Has Persistent Complex Bereavement Disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, and is a recovering alcoholic.
> 
> Killed his sister in a car crash via manslaughter while drunk, had the choice of jail or the foundation as he worked for the government, and the foundation already had their eye out for him, read [[[SCP-4412]]] for details it’s all explained there
> 
> Likes dogs

------

And a short list of my not as prominent characters (that I hope to use more!):

**Junior Researcher Quinn Whyte:** A depressed relatively new foundation employee who hates his job and hopes to do something great one day.

**Dr. Marvin Waters:** Researcher Whyte's boss. A generally nice guy who mostly does office work due to a permanent leg injury.

**Dr. Dolly Dickson:** A sweet southern girl who specializes in phenomena. [[[*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4482 | Star Villa's]]] girlfriend.

**Agent Micheal "Oreo" O'Riley:** An agent who likes to get right to the point. Not good with humor, but is okay with the nickname.

**Dr. Mark Good:** Pathologist, took Senior Researcher McNamara's position after he [[[*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4846 | retired]]].

**Dr. April Perry:** Likes to handle the dirty work on the field, works with Dr. Good and Dr. Nelly Flowers.

**Dr. Nelly Flowers/"Dr. Flo":** Works with stubborn sapient anomalies and dangerous sapient anomalies. Dating Dr. Jessica Thompson.

**Dr. Jessica Thompson:** Does a lot of desk work and interviews. Dating Dr. Nelly Flowers.

**--Dr.-- Agent Epon Scarlett:** An egotistical, delusional reality bender.  The Foundation is still trying to catch him.

**Prof. Elizabeth Wilbert:** Lead of Scarlett's case, dealt with his bullshit before he was fired, and still deals with it now.
