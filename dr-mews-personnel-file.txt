This is to be expected. Dr. Mew is a very normal and boring foundation employee. Except she is a cat. There is that.

++ __**Researcher Oliver Crane**__

**Name:** Researcher Oliver Crane

**Clearance Level:** Level 4

**Specialties:** Anomalous technology specialist, technological expert, visually triggered cognitohazards, vocal exploration leader

**Location:** Primarily Site 288, Site 23, occasionally other sites when needed.

**History:** Researcher Crane was born completely blind, which was proven useful in research of visually activated cognitohazards. Before joining the Foundation, Researcher Crane had a job as a Computer & Information Research Scientist. He excelled at the job, knowing far more about coding and software engineering then required. Researcher Crane developed his own touch to hear technology in the form of a glove and Bluetooth earpiece to aid him around daily life.

Researcher Crane grew up in Airdrie, Scotland. He lacked an ideal upbringing, undergoing severe emotional and physical abuse by his father daily. The trauma of his past affects him to this day, as he developed Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Researcher Crane has biweekly therapy sessions with Dr. Johnson.

Researcher Crane is often accompanied by Dr. Stanley Diamond when off-site, due to the two‚Äôs friendship.

++ __**Dr. Stanley Diamond**__

**Name:** Dr. Stanley Diamond

**Clearance Level:** Level 3

**Occupation:** Geologist

**Specialties:** Archeological anomalies, geological anomalies

**Location:** Site 288, Site 23, wherever needed

**History:** Dr. Diamond was the head researcher of SCP-‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà, and involved in Incident SCP-‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà. In result of the incident, Dr. Diamond received a facial wound.

Dr. Diamond‚Äôs mother was murdered by his uncle when he was five years old. Although he dislikes the details, the exact situation was traumatic, ever changing how he viewed the world, and the people in it.

**Profile:** Dr. Diamond has been described by others as ‚Äúan egotistical, selfish asshole‚Äù around anyone who is not Researcher Oliver Crane. Dr. Diamond has developed a somewhat protective nature for Researcher Crane, accompanying him on offsite missions, as well as emotionally stressing ones.

[Author‚Äôs Note: Dr. Diamond has PTSD and Borderline Personality Disorder, but has refuted the diagnoses, despite being diagnosed twice by two different doctors.]

++ __**Dr. Juniper Marigold**__

**Name:** Dr. Juniper ‚ÄúMarigold‚Äù Daisy

**Clearance Level:** Level 4

**Profession:** Microbiology researcher, sapient anomalies specialist

**Location:** Site 23, Site 43

**Profile:** Dr. Marigold communicates somewhat stoically, keeping a monotone voice, an expressionless face. Despite this, her individuality still shines through in her mannerisms such as: sitting on the floor opposed to a chair as much as possible, constantly moving one of her limbs (eg: leg, arm, hand, or rocking back and forth), being incredibly blunt, not realizing when things she says are out of place, and extreme love of animals with more than four limbs (which shows). Dr. Marigold enjoys watching the fish tank in her office, reading books, judging other people‚Äôs decisions, and interacting with safe class anomalies.

**History:** Dr. Marigold has been working for the Foundation every since she received her master's degree in microbiology. She became aware and interested in the position due to her mother‚Äôs job as a Foundation researcher.

After two years of working with her mother, incident ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà-‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà occurred, ending in her mother‚Äôs termination. Although Dr. Marigold was not involved, she still felt it was her job to take her mother‚Äôs place. She took up working with sapient anomalies and is now where she is today.

++ __**Dr. Kenny Hart**__

**Name:** Dr. Kenneth Hart

**Clearance Level:** Level 4

**Occupation:** Site Psychologist

**Specialties:** Personnel recovery following interactions with emotionally stressing anomalies

**Location:** Site 23, Site 288

**Profile:** Dr. Hart is a man who prefers to keep to himself. He doesn‚Äôt often express his emotions and has only [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4412 | one]]] close friend. Despite this, his work as a psychologist has remained unaffected.

Dr. Hart has a past with getting into physical fights, and winning by a landslide. It's not a part of himself he prefers to share.

[Author‚Äôs Note: Dr. Hart and Researcher Gates are dating, but have not and do not plan to inform the Foundation of this.]

[Author‚Äôs Note #2: Dr. Hart is //incredibly// easy to anger, especially if Researcher Gates is insulted around him. He‚Äôs been working on it, but he has a bit of a lack on impulse control.]


++ __**Researcher Kevin R. Gates**__

**Name:** Kevin R. Gates

**Clearance Level:** Level 2

**Occupation:** Semi-retired Mechanical Engineer

**Profile:** After his interaction with [[[*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4412 | SCP-4412]]], Researcher Gates has not worked with many anomalies due to decline in mental health.

Researcher Gates can still work with anomalies when accompanied by Dr. Hart

And a short list of my not as prominent characters (that I hope to use more!):

**Junior Researcher Quinn Whyte:** A depressed relatively new foundation employee who hates his job and hopes to do something great one day.

**Dr. Marvin Waters:** Researcher Whyte's boss. A generally nice guy who mostly does office work due to a permanent leg injury.

**Dr. Dolly Dickson:** A sweet southern girl who specializes in phenomena. [[[*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4482 | Star Villa's]]] girlfriend.

**Agent Micheal "Oreo" O'Riley:** An agent who likes to get right to the point. Not good with humor, but is okay with the nickname.

**Dr. Mark Good:** Pathologist, took Senior Researcher McNamara's position after he [[[*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4846 | retired]]].

**Dr. April Perry:** Likes to handle the dirty work on the field, works with Dr. Good and Dr. Nelly Flowers.

**Dr. Nelly Flowers/"Dr. Flo":** Works with stubborn sapient anomalies and dangerous sapient anomalies. Dating Dr. Jessica Thompson.

**Dr. Jessica Thompson:** Does a lot of desk work and interviews. Dating Dr. Nelly Flowers.

**--Dr.-- Agent Epon Scarlett:** An egotistical, delusional reality bender.¬†¬†The Foundation is still trying to catch him.

**Prof. Elizabeth Wilbert:** Lead of Scarlett's case, dealt with his bullshit before he was fired, and still deals with it now.
