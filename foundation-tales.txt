title:Foundation Tales
This is the Fanfiction (or just plain fiction) Section of the SCP Site. Any tales, so long as they involve some sort of SCP, the Foundation, or one of the other organizations, is at home here. (Hence the informal startup). 

This is one of the sections where rating will be the most important, so anyone who's reading the articles, do your part and vote. Reach a certain level of positive votes and your story will be entered in [[[The Vault]]], the home of the best stories. However, reach a certain level of //negative// votes, and the story will unfortunately be dropped completely from the site.

The only rules for this section, are that if you're going to use someone else's SCP, try and get permission first, but if that's not possible (i.e. the author is either unknown, or not around any more) feel free to use it, but try and stick to the spirit of the SCP, cool? When placing the story, put it in alphabetically. If it has multiple chapters, nest them inside the main link. If its just a oneshot, just do it regularly. Also, if the story contains themes of an adult nature, try and at least put a warning on the front. I don't know if we actually have any kids on this site, but hey, nothing wrong with covering the bases just in case.

Remember, the stuff you write doesn't have to be canon to the rest of the site, but if it isn't make sure to point that out in the **Theme** description.

We'll also have a fanfic of the week, of either the most highly voted, or one that's unanimously voted on by the Admins.

There's also another section that's more explicit, but its only for adults. There's more explanations inside.
