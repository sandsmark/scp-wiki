title:Foundation Tales
This is the Fanfiction (or just plain fiction) Section of the SCP Site. Any tales, so long as they involve some sort of SCP (including ones not on the main list), the Foundation, or one of the other organizations, are at home here.

The only rules for this section are that if you're going to use someone else's SCP, try and get permission first, but if that's not possible (i.e. the author is either unknown, or not around any more) feel free to use it, but try and stick to the spirit of the SCP.  This also applies to SCP researchers, agents, etc. If you're not sure, ask in [[[realtime-chat|the chat]]].

When placing the story, put it in alphabetically. If it has multiple chapters, nest them inside the main link. If it's just a oneshot, just do it regularly. If you wish, you can add your name alphabetically to the list of authors. Also, if the story contains themes of an adult nature, put a warning on the front. Just in case.

Remember, the stuff you write doesn't have to be canon to the rest of the site. There is no canon.

**Malcolm MacLean**
[[collapsible show="Xenophobia series" hide="hide collapsible"]]
Complete series here. This serial will make the most sense if you read it from top to bottom, although the paired interviews and recollections aren't very closely related to each other and you could read them out of order if you wanted to confuse yourself more. 

Disclaimer: This story does not represent the Foundation in a very positive light. If you don't like the idea of a unreliable, bitter narrator bitching about his superiors, don't read MacLean's interviews.  The story is written in such a way as to be open-ended in case I feel inclined to add more chapters later. Please PM me if you think you've noticed a formatting problem.
