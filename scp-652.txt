**Item #:** SCP-652

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-652 is to be kept in a soundproofed room some distance from facility habitation blocks. Room requires basic furnishings for SCP-652 and it's handler – bedding, food, water and so on. SCP-652 and handler are permitted to roam the facility grounds between the hours of 01;00 and 03;00 only, or whenever the facility is deemed to be least populated, whilst accompanied by a guard wearing ear protection (proofed to 90db). Staff should avoid interacting with SCP-652 unless wearing aforesaid ear protection.

**Description:** SCP-652 presents as an adult male, neutered dog of the Basset Hound breed. Subject appears to be physically beyond three (3) significant abnormalities;
* Subject's jaw muscles are well-developed, above that of a normal dog of this breed; however, bite force is in line with what is to be expected of a dog this size. This abnormality is likely to be a  direct result of abnormality 2, below.
* Subject's larynx is grossly distorted. X-ray examination shows significant diversion from expected size and shape. It is unclear whether this is a congenital disorder or the result of surgery.
* Subject has a branding on it's right haunch in the shape of the Marshall, Carter and Dark logo. The scar is well healed and was likely applied in the dog's infancy.

SCP-652 main abnormality, however, is it's ability to produce human speech. Subject constantly 'gibbers' English language words, apparently at random. The words have no obvious association with any external stimuli; while it can be assumed SCP-652 is aware of it's behaviour, it does not appear to be under the subject's control. The words produced also appear to have little relation to SCP-652's physical condition; speech is muted and 'mumbled' while the subject is asleep, and becomes unintelligible when SCP-652 is eating or drinking (in much the same way human speech is made less intelligible when a human is ingesting food or lapping water). Subject's 'voice' is low in pitch, and has a rather limited vocal range; staff consistently refer to it as 'unsettling'.

While SCP-652's unusual larynx is the most obvious link to the subject's constant vocal activity, a basic knowledge of speech production tells us that simply changing an animal's larynx will not necessarily allow it to make sounds similar to human speech; indeed, comparative biology reveals that human and canid larynx structures are actually quite similar. SCP-652's larynx, on the other hand, appears to have no correlation to either. Our current hypothesis is that the subject's constant gibbering is not a direct result of this modified larynx; another hypothesis is that this larynx structure works as a kind of 'biological speaker' that is receiving confused messages from the dog's brain.

The effect of SCP-652's 'gibbering' is still unproven. Initial studies suggest that significant time spent with it has a disturbing effect on human psychology; an observer becomes increasingly paranoid and obsessed with SCP-652's output - if this is allowed to continue, apophenia takes hold, and the observer will attempt to abduct SCP-652 for further study. This mental damage is permanent, as far as we can tell; however observers wearing ear protection or who are already deaf to the subject's vocalizations are unaffected. Please note, however, that the above is simply a working theory; the Foundation is aware that the three personnel affected by SCP-652 may have already been predisposed to mental disorders (although in Agent █████'s case, this seems unlikely), and SCP-652's involvement may have been a catalyst, rather than a cause. Regardless, SCP-652 has been put under the Special Containment Procedures outlined above for the protection of all staff.

**Addendum:** SCP-652 was retrieved as a result of the interception by the Foundation of communications between a Mr. █████ ██████, a solicitor suspected to be working for Marshall, Carter and Dark, and the estate of the late Earl of ███████, Lord ███ ██████. It appears Lord ██████ obtained a 'permanent lease', at some personal cost, of SCP-652, with the condition that the subject was to be returned to Marshall, Carter and Dark upon the Earl's death. Upon hearing news of Lord ██████'s suicide, Mr. ██████ began proceedings to transfer SCP-652 to a holding facility, the location of which is still unknown to the Foundation. Due to the diligence of Agent █████, however, this transfer was intercepted and SCP-652 was taken into Foundation custody.

Unfortunately, Agent █████ was both responsible for SCP-652's acquisition and it's first victim. While preparing a preliminary report, Agent █████ showed a marked decrease in operational efficiency over a 48-hour period; as the deadline for the report passed, several staff members reported concern over Agent █████'s mental state. This culminated in an attempt to abduct SCP-652 from Foundation custody, prevented only by the vigilance of site security staff. Agent █████ has since been transferred to █████ Hospital, after being sectioned under the Mental Health Act 1983. Consultants at █████ agree that Agent █████'s release is unforeseeable. 

SCP-652's first handlers, two D-Class personnel (D-4873 and D-4877) assigned after Agent █████'s arrest, met a similar fate – after a short period where the two personnel showed increasing signs of mental stress, paranoia and obsession with SCP-652, D-4873 murdered his companion and was killed trying to scale the perimeter fence with SCP-652 concealed in a bag slung over his shoulder.

Since these two incidents, staff have been instructed to keep interaction with SCP-652 to a minimum; D-Class personnel assigned as handlers are required to be permanently deafened (to a minimum degree of 90db) or, if no hearing impaired personnel are available, a handler is to be  surgically deafened through bilateral destruction of the organ of Corti. In order to retain the handler's co-operation, it is suggested that personnel undergoing surgery are told the procedure is temporary. D-Class handlers are to be terminated at the end of each month, as per Foundation requirements.
