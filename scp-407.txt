**Item#:** SCP-407

**Object Class:**  Euclid / Neutralized

**Special Containment Procedures:**  At time of acquisition SCP-407 was recorded within a compact cassette tape.  Currently, SCP-407 is backed-up as an .mp3 file on [DATA EXPUNGED].  SCP-407 should not be allowed to play under any circumstances outside testing conditions, and only with the approval of O5-██.

Testing of SCP-407 is to be done in completely sterile environments.  All tools, and subjects must be sterilized to remove the presence of pollen, fungal spores, plant seeds, and as much bacterial life to the greatest degree possible.

**Description:** SCP-407 is a song in an unidentified language, seemingly sung by a chorus.  The tape containing SCP-407 was found with approximately 30 minutes of track, though the abrupt ending suggests there may be more.  The song has been described by all listeners something along the lines of 'soothing', 'glorious', and 'beautiful'.

While SCP-407 is played, rapid cell generation seems to occur within auditory radius.  This seems to affect multi-cellular organisms only at first, but quickly begins to affect single-celled reproduction.  The song seems to affect the cells themselves, and does not require the subject be able to hear. 

The rapid cell generation caused by SCP-407 has shown that it can help heal subjects from even the most powerful infections of deadliest wounds, with only a few seconds of exposure.  However, after a minute or so of exposure, most subjects experience unrestrained cell growth, manifesting in quickly advancing dermal growths. These, though painful and disfiguring, are benign and usually not immediately life threatening.  However, increased bacterial growth occurs after approximately four (4) minutes, which can be highly dangerous. Shortly thereafter, any trace elements of plants or fungus begin to grow and replicate uncontrollably.  Eventually, even dead matter seems to become reanimated.  Full results have varied depending on the test, and on the objects present when SCP-407 is played.

**Acquisition:**  SCP-407 was found in the home of Professor ██████ of ██████████, who had recently returned from research in the Amazon regions of northern Brazil.  Agents were first alerted to a possible SCP when [DATA EXPUNGED]


**Sample Test Notes**:
**<Test 1; SCP-407 played for 28m 32s.  Within chamber; 1 D-Class personnel, unsterilized >**
> //00:25// - Subject reported feeling soothed by the music, and of feeling stronger and more invigorated.  
> 
> //00:45// - Liver spots and scars previously seen are shown to disappear.
> 
> //02:20// - Subject appears to have physically grown an inch.  Increase in musculature is noticeable.  
> 
> //03:40// - Subject reports intestinal pain.
> 
> //04:20// - Subject begins vomiting.  From vomit, plants are seen growing and slowly rooting into the tile floor.
> 
> //04:50// - Subject starts developing rashes and growths on skin.
> 
> //05:30// - Heavy dermal disfigurement.  Subject panting heavily, begging for help.  Great pain reported.
>  
> //06:10// - Subject falls to the ground and ceases to move.
> 
> //06:45// - Subject's body is quickly covered in what is thought to be fungal infections.  Plant growth is observed growing from the subject's mouth, then eye sockets.
> 
> //07:30// - Subject is by this time unrecognizable, covered in molds and plant shoots.  Body bursts as a banana tree emerges from the subject's intestines and proceed to grow to maturity within seconds.
> 
> //08:45// - Plant and fungal growth has begun to spread throughout the testing chamber.  What appears to be moss and weeds cover the floor.
> 
> //9:30// - Several shoots, stalks, bushes, and even small trees have appeared.  Banana tree is no longer recognizable; the tree has grown thick and is covered with foliage and fungal growth.
> 
> //10:30// - The air is heavy with pollen and spores.  Vision into testing chamber is difficult.
> 
> //11:30// - Movement is heard within the chamber.  Several different small insect-like creatures are observed.  Creatures seemingly made of plant matter.
> 
> //17:30// - For the last six minutes, creatures made of plant matter have been observed to rapidly generate, grow to maturity, kill and eat other creatures, and then be eaten themselves.  Creatures increasingly progressing in size as time increases.
> 
> //19:00// - Medium sized mammalian creatures are observed; they seem humanoid and bearing a resemblance to initial Subject.
> 
> //21:00// - Large fungal stalk is observed to grow from one of the mammalian creatures.  Stalk end bursts, dispensing white spores.
> 
> //22:00// - Plant growth is still lush, but everything begins to become coated by a layer of mold.  The plant creatures seem to die slowly for an unknown reason, before being covered by the mold.
> 
> //23:00// - Mammalian creatures are the last to succumb; they heavily decay and become covered in the same mold.  Bodies are shown to contract and expand as if breathing.  Stalks quickly rise from the bodies, burst with spores, and then just as quickly rot.
> 
> //28:32// - Tape ends.  No change in chamber since the appearance of the mold.  Chamber undergoes rigorous anti-biological cleansing.  Samples of the mold were taken.  [See Addendums 407-01, 407-02]

**<End Test 1>**


**Addendum 407-01:** - The mold that eventually resulted from SCP-407's first test appears to be some sort of Cordyceps Fungi.  Noted to be similar to mold encountered by [[[SCP-507]]].  Due to fear of fulfilling a fate similar to that observe dby 507, testing using SCP-407 has been limited to using only the first fifteen minutes of the recording.

**Addendum 407-03** - SCP-407 has been deleted from the system by what is now known to the foundation as Interest Group: Serpent's Hand.  All known backup copies of SCP-407 have also been deleted.  Refer to [[[Security Breach Incident - X23]]].
