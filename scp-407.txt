**Item#:** SCP-407

**Object Class:**  Neutralized

**Special Containment Procedures:**  At time of acquisition SCP-407 was recorded within a compact cassette tape.  At first the tape itself was classified as an SCP object in its own right, but after initial analysis it was discovered the tape itself was completely ordinary.  The original cassette was discarded, and SCP-407 is currently recorded in an .mp3 file available [DATA EXPUNGED].  SCP-407 should not be allowed to play under any circumstances outside testing conditions, and only with the approval of O5-██.[OUTDATED; see addendum 407-03] 

Testing of SCP-407 is to be done in completely sterile environments.  All tools, and subjects must be sterilized to remove the presence of pollen, fungal spores, plant seeds, and as much bacterial life to the greatest degree possible.  Only Class-D personnel should be used for human testing.

**Description:** SCP-407 is a song in an unidentified language, seemingly sung by a chorus.  The tape containing SCP-407 was found with approximately 30 minutes of track, though the abrupt ending suggests there may be more.  The song has been described by all listeners something along the lines of 'soothing' and 'glorious' and 'beautiful'.

While SCP-407 is played, rapid cell generation seems to occur within auditory radius.  Testing shown that a few minutes exposure to SCP-407's sound can help the body heal even from the most powerful infections or deadliest wounds.  However, the threshold before unfavorable effects set in seem to unpredictable; SCP-407 also seems to begin to cause increased bacterial growth after approximately four (4) minutes.  Shortly thereafter, any trace elements of plants or fungus begin to grow and replicate uncontrollably.  Eventually, even dead matter seems to become reanimated.  Full results have varied depending on the test, and on the objects present when SCP-407 is played.

**Acquisition:**  SCP-407 was found in the home of Proffesor ██████ of ██████████, who had recently returned from research in the Amazon regions of northern Brazil.  Agents were first alerted to a possible SCP when [DATA EXPUNGED]


**Sample Test Notes**:
**<Test 1; SCP-407 played for 28m 32s.  Within chamber; 1 D-Class personnel, unsterilized >**
> //00:45// - Subject reported feeling soothed by the music, and of feeling stronger and more invogorated.
> 
> //02:20// - Subject appears to have physically grown an inch.  Increase in musculature is noticeable.  Liver spots and scars previously seen are shown to disappear.
> 
> //03:40// - Subject reports intestinal pain.
> 
> //04:20// - Subject begins vomiting.  From vomit, plants are seen growing and slowly rooting into the tile floor.
> 
> //04:50// - Subject starts developing rashes and growths on skin.
> 
> //06:10// - After having spent the last minute panting heavily, subject falls to the ground and ceases to move.
> 
> //06:45// - Subject's body is overgrown with what look like fungal infections.  Plant growth is observed growing from the subject's mouth, then eye sockets.
> 
> //07:30// - Subject is by this time unrecognizable, covered in molds and plant shoots.  Body bursts as a banana tree emerges from the subject's intestines and proceed to grow to maturity within seconds.
> 
> //08:45// - Plant and fungal growth has begun to spread throughout the testing chamber.  What appears to be moss and weeds cover the floor.
> 
> //9:30// - Several shoots, stalks, bushes, and even small trees have appeared.  Banana tree is no longer recognizable; the tree has grown thick and is covered with foliage and fungal growth.
> 
> //10:30// - The air is heavy with pollen and spores.  Vision into testing chamber is difficult.
> 
> //11:30// - Movement is hear within the chamber.  Several different creatures are observed, seemingly made of plant matter.
> 
> //17:30// - The creatures have spent the last six minutes growing to maturity within seconds, devouring other creatures, then being themselves devoured by a larger one, all while new creatures continue to appear.
> 
> //19:00// - Mammalian creatures are observed; they seem humanoid and bearing a ressemblance to initial Subject.
> 
> //21:00// - Large fungal stalk is observed to grow from one of the mammalian creatures.  Stalk end bursts, dispensing white spores.
> 
> //22:00// - Plant growth is still lush, but everything begins to become coated by a layer of mold.  The plant creatures seem to die slowly for an unknown reason, before being covered by the mold.
> 
> //23:00// - Mammalian creatures are the last to succumb; they heavily decay and become covered in the same mold.  Bodies are shown to contract and expand as if breathing.  Stalks quickly rise from the bodies, burst with spores, and then just as quickly rot.
> 
> //28:32// - Tape ends.  No change in chamber since the appearance of the mold.  Chamber undergoes rigorous anti-biological cleansing.  Samples of the mold were taken.  [See Addendums 407-01, 407-02]

**<End Test 1>**


**Addendum 407-01:** - The mold that eventually resulted from SCP-407's first test appears to be some sort of Cordyceps Fungi.  Noted to be similar to mold encountered by [[[SCP-507]]].  Due to this, testing using SCP-407 has been limited to using only the first fifteen minutes of the recording.

**Addendum 407-02** - The biocontainment unit that was tasked with cleansing the testing chamber for test 1 was unable to destroy a single large seed which they found amongst the burning mold.  This seed would become [[[SCP-410-1 ]]], and SCP-410-2 would go on to reveal the true nature of SCP-407.

**Interview with SCP-410-02:**

**<Begin Log>**

> //Dr. ██████  // So, what can you tell us of your origins?
> 
> //SCP-410-2:// The bearer of progeny would have taken nine by seven scores to germ and five by ten sets of ten to bloom and drop the kin of leaf and life.
> 
> //Dr. ██████  // [Using calculator] So you’re saying the tree came about 1760 years early?  Was this entirely due to SCP-407’s effect?
> 
> //SCP-410-2:// Though the bearer did know his time was not near, the song was corrupted and too much to bear.
> 
> //Dr. ██████  //  The song was corrupted? 
> 
> //SCP-410-2:// The song should be sung by voice and gasp and soul, not the cold unnatural wail of your devices.  Power without soul and voice builds without direction.

**Addendum 407-03** - SCP-407 has been deleted from the system by what is now known to the foundation as Interest Group: Serpent's Hand.  All known backup copies of SCP-407 have also been deleted.  Refer to [[[Security Breach Incident - X23]]].
