Oh, hey, good day %%name%%.

Oh, hey... Why aren't you using a Wikidot account? Eh, whatever.

I like cats, food, drinks, living, staying at home, writing, watching, I think you get the point. I recently joined the wiki a few months ago, though, as of writing this it will be outdated in the future.

I'm your typical highschool Asian living in Canada (pretty cool place, just saying). I joined the wiki because quarantine forced me to, I had nothing else to do at home. I like writing, as much as I love thinking up ideas. I also procrastinate a lot. I personally enjoy writing for the wiki, and I have more tales than I do SCPs, though I do plan to make more SCPs. I'd appreciate it if you left a comment on exactly what was good/not good in the articles I post, since it'll help me in the future.

Mmm… I don't know what else to say. 
I guess you guys should check out my stuff.

[[[SCP-5278|SCP-5278 - A Ghost Town Isn't Always Abandoned]]]

[http://scp-wiki-cn.wikidot.com/scp-5278 Chinese Translation!]

[[collapsible show="• Commentary •" hide="○ Close ○"]]
So, this SCP was my first ever published SCP that actually managed to do well.

It's essentially about a ghost town that was destroyed during an ore trade in the 1960-80's. Focusing on the instance named "Hendrick Folry", this SCP was a rather light-hearted aloof one. I wanted to imply that ghosts aren't only dangerous, some can be friendly, or even harbor lingering feelings (which is why they're ghosts).

At first, I wasn't expecting the draft to go all that well, considering that I had literally no articles. However, I got rather positive reviews. While some may complain there's a certain "lack of tension" (which I can see why), this article is really meant to have no true conflict. It was rather focused on the feelings that ghosts may have, and father-to-kid feelings.

In the end, it worked out well. And I'm fairly proud of it.

[[[Bright, in the Fantadation]]]
[[collapsible show="• Commentary •" hide="○ Close ○"]]
This was my first ever article ever published in general.

After reading [[*user Ekronak]]'s tale series on the canon Doctors of the Church, I had this thought about making the Foundation into a super fantasy-esque world. Surprisingly, such a thing hadn't been done before, so I decided to write up a tale about it.

I turned it into a series, and it's been received fairly well. I plan to add more to it, since as of now, there are currently two parts. However, I really enjoy writing in a fantasy tone, and it brings the Foundation into a somewhat new light.

[[[Where the Followers Remain]]]

The second article I've ever published on the site.

After making the introduction tale to the fantasy tale series, I quickly sprung into action to make the second part of the series. Taking into account the three current MCs (Bright, Clef, and Xyank), I had them each branch off into different paths. As of now, the tale is focusing one at a time on each character, and I later plan to have them converge once more.

[[[The Danelaw of Jorvik]]]
[[collapsible show="• Commentary •" hide=" ○ Close○"]]
This is the final piece for the development of the (up and coming) canon called Saints and Heathens.

It focuses on the political problems within the states of Jorvik, a place within Europe (If I recall correctly). With the numerous losses King Halfdan has had with King Alfred, he decided to confront Alfred about the war. It was pretty enjoyable writing this piece, and I hope it's enjoyable to read it as well. :)
