**Item #:** SCP-671

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-671 must be kept at Sector-██ in a clear plastic terrarium no less than 10mx1mx1m whose piece are assembled by heat merging only. It should contain at least 400 kg of sandy soil with humidity level at least ██,█%. Appropriate food source is provided via a hatch every week. The room will be monitored by four cameras at all times and closed by a two-door sealed room, which is flooded with an insecticide harmless to humans before the outside door is opened. The inside door will be built so that no piece beyond the panel itself can be touched from inside the room, and all fixture in the room will be either sealed or built into the walls themselves

While individuals are outside the terrarium, personnel entering the room must wear only clothes that SCP-671 will not attempt to affect, use insect deterrents, or wear a sealed single-piece suit over all of their normal clothing. All materials but the most simple must be kept within a sealed transparent plastic bag or similarly protect by insecticide or repellent. Should SCP-671 individuals get out of the terrarium outside of an experimental procedure, the room shall be flooded with insecticide.

Due to the presence of this SCP, no SCP which can potentially be disassembled is to be kept at Sector-██, and SCP-671 may never enter a facility where such SCPs are kept.

**Description:** SCP-671 is a fairly large colony of Spanish carpenter ants (//Camponotus cruentatus//), containing approximately 30,000 individuals. When SCP-671 is faced with a complex artificial device (living organisms or their dead carcasses are treated normally), its constituent individuals will attempt to reduce it to its simplest components, and appear attracted to it as if it where a food source. Screws will be unscrewed, staples and nails pulled out etc. In the process, even lone individuals are able to exert forces several hundred times higher than normal individuals of the same species. Since large numbers of individual will collaborate, they are capable, when working in concert, of surprising feats.

The only types of joint that appears to not be taken apart are those involving the same material used to "merge" two things of the same material together, for example the rocks in concrete, paper glued together (unless the glue is so thick as to represent a separate "part", such as in book binds), soldered metal, as well as material completely encased in other material. Great care is taken to avoid damaging the parts when taking apart objects, although a material or item serving as a joint (e.g. glue, mortar, rivets) are likely to be destroyed in the process.

Objects are reduced to their smallest possible constituents: fabric are flayed thread by thread, as are multi-thread objects like rope, rolled joints are pulled apart etc. Using this innate ability SCP-671 (with about 15,000 members at the time) can disassemble a sedan in approximately 48 hours, and a 10-floors steel-frame building in a month. They show little method or intelligence when doing this and will mindlessly attempt to take apart running machinery or containers of poison at great risk to themselves and the colony. A good example occurred in ████ of ████ at Alcanar, Spain, when a group of SCP-671 individuals proceeded to disassemble the motor of a running tanker truck, resulting in [[DATA EXPUNGED]]. As such in case of containment breach, leaving large containers of insecticides or corrosive substances near the colony may be effective

**Addendum**: //Following Incident 671-A, personnel are reminded that "sealed single-piece suit over all of their normal clothing" means that the suit must also cover the feet, and suits which include separate foot covers such as used on some other SCPs are not appropriate for interaction with SCP-671.// -- Dr. Ziegler

**Incident 671-A**: Agent Thornton, having just gotten out of an experiment with SCP-███, assumed that his airtight suit would be sufficient as he went to check on the result of a current experiment involving a box of Oreo cookies. Unbeknownst to him, the ants began to disassemble his military-type boots almost as soon as he entered the room. As he prepared to leave, he tripped over the shoelaces that had been partly undone and flayed and fell to the ground, suffering a sprained knee and dislocated shoulder in the process.
