**Item #:** SCP-671

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-671 must be kept in a clear plastic terrarium no less than 10mx1mx1m whose piece are assembled by heat merging only. It should contain at least 400 kg of sandy soil with humidity level at least x. Appropriate food source is provided via  hatch every week. The room will be monitored by four cameras at all times. Should SCP-671 individuals get out of the terrarium outside of an experimental procedure, the room shall be flooded with insecticide.

**Description:** SCP-671 is a fairly large colony of Spanish carpenter ants (//Camponotus cruentatus//), containing approximately 30,000 individuals. When SCP-671 is faced with a complex device, its constituent individuals will attempt to reduce it to its simplest components, and appear attracted to it as if it where a food source. Screws will be unscrewed, staples and nails pulled out etc. In the process, even lone individuals are able to exert forces several hundred times higher than normal individuals of the same species. Since large rnumbers of individual will collaborate, the are capable, when working in concert, of surprising feats.

The only types of joint that appears to not be taken apart are those involving the same material used to "merge" two things of the same material together, for example the rocks in concrete, paper glued together (unless the glue is so thick as to represent a separate "part", such as in book binds), soldered metal, as well as material completely encased in other material. Great care is taken to avoid damaging the parts when taking apart objects, although a material or item serving as a joint (e.g. glue, mortar, rivets) are likely to be destroyed in the process.

Objects are reduced to their smallest possible constituents: fabric are flayed thread by thread, as are multi-thread objects, rolled joints are pulled apart (as such a possible containment technique might simply be to leave cans of insecticide to be disassembled) etc. Using it SCP-671 can disassemble a sedan in approximately 48 hours, and a 10-floors steel-frame building in a month.
