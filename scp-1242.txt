**Item #:** SCP-1242

**Object Class:** Euclid 

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1242 is to be contained in two (2) adjoining rooms measuring 2m x 2m x 3m capable of sustaining quarantine for a Category A, UN 2814 biohazard. The rooms should be separated by an airlock. All access to subject is to be limited to a single entry point equipped with remote handling, clean room, decontamination, and quarantine facilities. Remote handling is to be used when interacting with SCP-1242 whenever possible. Level A biohazard suits are required for all non-test subjects physically interacting with SCP-1242.

Nutritional needs are human normal, and should be met using standard quarantine protocols. Waste material should be treated as a Category A, UN 2814 biohazard. Waste may be disposed of only after heat-sterilization and storage for a period of no less than 14 days to ensure success of the sterilization procedures. Under no circumstances are any chemical sterilization procedures to be attempted. 

Subject is on strict suicide watch, --and is not allowed any object or material that would facilitate self-termination.-- Due to subject's proven capacity for self-harm, all requests made by subject must be approved by Site Director.

**Description:** SCP-1242 appears to be an adolescent Caucasian human male 137 cm in height, weighing 41 kilos. Subject does not appear to age.

Subject communicates primarily in English, though it has been observed to be capable of profanity in four languages, and to have a moderate understanding of Spanish. Subject is intelligent, and generally cooperative to Foundation personnel.

Subject exudes a retro-viral agent, hereafter referred to as SCP-1242-1, from all bodily orifices and glands. SCP-1242-1 is 99.9% infectious when transmitted by direct contact through ingestion and skin contact. SCP-1242-1 has been shown to be infectious to varying degrees through indirect contact for up to 14 days on average, with the longest recorded period between viral emission and infection being ~26 days.

SCP-1242-1 contains the genetic makeup of SSCP-1242, and acts to reconfigure the DNA and physical configuration of infected individuals to match that of SCP-1242 with 98% efficacy. Individuals infected are to be classified as SCP-1242-1a and quarantined immediately. Infection is followed by an incubation period of 6 hours, after which individuals begin to undergo a metamorphosis. 

* **Six hours:** SCP-1242-1a experience acute pain in joints, fever ranging from 38-40 C, respiratory difficulty, cardiac arrhythmia, and cyanotic extremities. SCP-1242-1 ceases to be infectious at this time. 

* **Eight hours:** SCP-1242-1a begins experiencing violent emesis, diarrhea, and perspiration beyond the levels associated with fever temperatures. Waste produced in this manner is comprised of tissue types from throughout the body. Subjects begin to gradually decrease in mass and physical size. Subjects in this stage indicate that pain is now global to the body, and intense.

* **Nine hours:** Symptoms accelerate as subject rapidly decreases in size. All identifying characteristics native to race are eliminated and subject's body begins restructuring to achieve the end stage result.

* **Ten hours:** Subject's body structure now closely resembles SCP-1242. Emesis and diarrhea abate. SCP-1242-1 is once again infectious. 

* **Eleven hours:** All symptoms abate. Subject is now visually indistinguishable from SCP-1242, and is designated SCP-1242-2.

SCP-1242-2 may be distinguished from SCP-1242 only by testing. SCP-1242-2 do not produce SCP-1242-1 as a biological by-product, carrying and transmitting it instead as an infectious blood-borne pathogen. 

Instances of SCP-1242-2 possess intelligence commensurate to that of SCP-1242, but display a demeanor consistent with ingestion of moderate doses of MDMA. SCP-1242-2 appear to have a drive to protect SCP-1242, and in the pursuit of that goal will seek out and infect individuals to propagate more instances of SCP-1242-2. 

SCP-1242 was initially contained after reports from a rural town in ████████████, ██ of identical boys corresponding with reports of individuals disappearing. 

Subject was located in an outlying structure 1.2 km outside of the town proper surrounded by 24 instances of SCP-1242-2.  Subject immediately warned Foundation personnel away, but made no attempt to escape. Agents ████████ and ████ were both exposed to SCP-1242-1 in the course of interviewing the subject. Agent ████████ recognized a potential biohazard and was able to communicate the necessary precautions before succumbing to infection. 

Containment teams eradicated all present instances of SCP-1242-2 and took SCP-1242 into custody. The town was placed under quarantine until such time as a lack of infections was determined to exist. Class C amnesiacs were administered to the population, who were then relocated under a claim of eminent domain. The area of potential infection was then sterilized.

SCP-1242 has displayed bouts of chronic depression associated with post-traumatic stress disorder and long-term isolation. Subject avoids discussion of the onset of its condition, and refuses to give its name. Its fingerprints do not match any on file. 

**Addendum A:** Reports of instances of SCP-1242-2 outside of Foundation control have been corroborated and neutralized on five (5) separate dates. Instances have been located as far as 4700 km from the point of initial containment. Attempts to question SCP-1242 about these instances have been met with escalation of depressive behavior and emotional withdrawal.

**Addendum B:** Following Incident 1242-1, instances of SCP-1242-2 will be actively sought out and destroyed with all expediency.

[On ██/██/20██, fifty-six (56) instances of SCP-1242-2 mounted an assault on Site ██, where SCP-1242 is contained. Instances were armed with weapons ranging from small arms to explosive munitions made from commercially available ingredients. Instances displayed coordination and tactics at a level associated with a dedicated civilian militia training full time for a sustained period. Initial incursion was minimal due to rapid response by perimeter teams and initiation of site lockdown.  

While initial casualties were low, casualties from infection of personnel by SCP-1242-1 were high, and nearly resulted in the loss of the site as secondary instances of SCP-1242-2 formed and began using perimeter teams' weapons to attempt incursion into the site before offsite response teams could achieve the level of containment necessary to sanitize the combat areas. 

It is still unknown how instances were able obtain weapons and locate SCP-1242.
