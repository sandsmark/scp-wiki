**Item #:** SCP-4618

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4618 is to be contained within the legally defined boundaries of Brighton High School. Witnesses of SCP-4618 manifestations are to be administered Class-A amnestics.

In the event that instances of SCP-4618-A manifest, they are to be permitted mobility within Brighton High School to perform their occupations, remotely monitored with closed circuit television cameras. Under no circumstances are personnel to prevent SCP-4618-A instances from accessing SCP-4618.

Any substances extracted from SCP-4618-A instances are to be stored in low-level bio-hazard containers for study.

**Description:** SCP-4618 is a 1994 Ford Ranger, located within Brighton High School in Positano, California, USA. The vehicle has been property of the school since the original date of manufacture. SCP-4618 operates non-anomalously; its performance is identical to that of baseline Ford Rangers. 

SCP-4618 will exhibit its anomalous properties on any day where classes are scheduled at Brighton High School. At 7:03 AM, SCP-4618 will vanish from its current location, and reappear at a set location within Brighton High School at 7:09 AM. Following this routine, three individuals, collectively designated SCP-4618-A, will appear within SCP-4618.

Instances of SCP-4618-A claim to be instructors employed by Brighton High School. These claims have been verified by school documentation, although no payroll documentation exists. SCP-4618-A instances will instruct their scheduled classes in a non-anomalous manner. Students taught by SCP-4618-A instances will not exhibit any anomalous properties. 

After the conclusion of the school day, the SCP-4618-A instances will return to SCP-4618. The vehicle will vanish with the instances at 4:55 PM, and reappear at 5:03 PM empty. SCP-4618 will perform its routines on schedule regardless of the presence of SCP-4618-A instances.

The following table documents all known SCP-4618-A instances. Apart from Brighton High School employment documents, no other legal documents exist under the given names.

> 
> **Donahue:** Hi, Javier. I'd like to ask a few questions about you.
> 
> **SCP-4618-A-1:** Sure. Go ahead.
> 
> **Donahue:** How long have you worked at Brighton High School?
> 
> **SCP-4618-A-1:** Oh, a //long// time. I know this school very well. 
> 
> **Donahue:** Can you give me a more accurate answer please? As in, how many years?
> 
> **SCP-4618-A-1:** Um... nineteen. Nineteen years.
> 
> **Donahue:** Alright then. How did you first get this job? Do you remember?
> 
> **SCP-4618-A-1:** Well, I applied for it, I guess, and I got the job, because I had my teaching credentials. 
> 
> **Donahue:** What do you do after classes are over?
> 
> **SCP-4618-A-1:** Well, I grade papers and homework, and around 4:50 I lock my classroom and go home.
> 
> **Donahue:** How do you get home, Javier?
> 
> **SCP-4618-A-1:** I take my pickup truck. Actually, it's technically not //my// pickup truck, it's the school's, but I still take it home anyway. 
> 
> **Donahue:** Do you commute home alone, or carpool, or what?
> 
> **SCP-4618-A-1:** I carpool with two other teachers. We meet at my truck and we drive home.
> 
> **Donahue:** Tell me who these other teachers are.
> 
> **SCP-4618-A-1:** Well, one of them is Tiffany, an English teacher, and the other is a P.E. teacher by the name of Clark. Did you know that Tiffany's last name is Langburger? //Langburger//. Who decided that their lineage would be named "Langburger"?
>

> 
> **Donahue:** Can you give me a more specific answer?

> **SCP-4618-A-1:** Look, I don't know why it's any of //your// business what I do outside of school. Would you like it if I decided to probe //your// private life?
> 
> **Donahue:** Well, I probably wouldn't like that, now would I?
> 
> **SCP-4618-A-1:** Just... don't ask people about their private lives, okay? People at this school, they like to keep to themselves, and they won't tolerate outsiders snooping in places they don't belong in.

> 
> **Spago:** I'll change the subject. How do you find your job?
> 
> **SCP-4618-A-3:** Being a P.E. teacher is one of the best things I've ever decided to do. Seeing the students every day trying to play basketball, it's just... charming, I should say.
> 
> **Spago:** What do you like to do on your days off?
> 
> **SCP-4618-A-3:** Um... I'm sorry, could you ask the question again?
> 
> **Spago:** When there isn't any school, what do you like to do?

> __**Test 4618-01**__
> 
> **Subject:** D-4991
> **Date:** 3/11/2013
> 
> **Procedure:** SCP-4618 was delivered to Site-56 before 7:03 AM. D-4991 was instructed to sit inside its cabin until demanifestation.
> 
> **Result:** SCP-4618 demanifested at 7:03 AM with D-4991. At 7:09 AM, SCP-4618 remanifested at Brighton High School with SCP-4618-A instances. Notably, D-4991 was not present. When interviewed, the SCP-4618-A instances claimed not to have met D-4991.
> 
> At 5:03 PM, after the completion of SCP-4618's afternoon routine, D-4991 reappeared. During debriefing, D-4991 expressed that he viewed SCP-4618 as "teleporting through a flash of yellow". D-4991 did not suffer any anomalous effects.

> __**Test 4618-02**__
> 
> **Subject:** D-6744
> **Date:** 3/13/2013
> 
> **Procedure:** Subject was instructed to sit within SCP-4618 with the SCP-4618-A instances before their departure at 4:55 PM.
> 
> **Result:** The SCP-4618-A instances expressed surprise and confusion at D-6744's presence. However, the instances still entered the cabin with D-6744. SCP-4618 performed its routine successfully. When the vehicle returned at 5:03 PM, D-6744 was absent.
> 
> On 3/14/2013, SCP-4618 remaifested at 7:09 AM without D-6744. When asked about his disappearance, the SCP-4618-A instances mentioned "dropping off [D-6744] at Lundee Street". 
> 
> D-6744 was recovered at Lundee Street in Fallen Leaf, California, USA, 442 kilometers from Brighton High School. It is of note that D-6744 was discovered in front of his former residence prior to Foundation employment.

> __**Test 4618-03**__
> 
> **Subject:** N/A
> **Date:** 3/15/2013
> 
> **Procedure:** A GPS tracker and dashboard camera were installed in SCP-4618 during school hours, to track the journey of SCP-4618-A. 
> 
> **Result:** When SCP-4618 vanished with the instances, its GPS signal disappeared from Foundation trackers. When SCP-4618 remanifested, the signal returned. The dashboard camera was recovered successfully.
> 
> Footage recorded by the camera consisted of a fully yellow screen for ninety-two hours before its memory was depleted.

> = [EXTRANEOUS LOGS REDACTED]

> __**Test 4618-06**__
> 
> **Subject:** N/A
> **Date:** 3/19/2013
> 
> **Procedure:** SCP-4618 was transported to Site-56 before 7:03 AM. A vehicle was parked at its remanifestation location.
> 
> **Result:** SCP-4618 vanished at 7:07 AM. At 7:14 AM, the vehicle reappeared at its demanifestation location at Site-56. 
> 
> The three SCP-4618-A instances were present, having been fused together into a single amorphous mass. The mass fully occupied the cabin, and took the rough shape of its interior. Each instance was capable of its own speech, but only emitted exclamations of pain. The mass was successfully extracted from SCP-4618.
> 
> An autopsy of the collective SCP-4618-A instance revealed that it was composed of thick organic plasma-like matter with a yellow color, with only the surface possessing a human appearance. No identifiable organs were found. After removal, the yellow substance was stored in low-level bio-hazard containers. 
> 
> The vehicle at the regular manifestation location was removed following the test. SCP-4618 vanished and reappeared in it regular location on schedule.
> 
> On 3/20/2013, three SCP-4618-A instances manifested successfully within SCP-4618. All instances did not appear to remember the events of the previous day. As a precaution, Class-A amnestics were administered. Due to the mass remaining at Site-56, the instances are thought to be duplicates.
> 
> **Notes:** //SCP-4618 possesses the ability to produce more of the SCP-4618-A instances, should it lose any. It is also prone to error when a new situation is introduced that interrupts its routine. -Researcher Tassajara//

> __**Test ????-07**__
> 
> **Subjects:** SCP-4618-A-1, SCP-4618-A-2, and SCP-4618-A-3
> **Date:** 3/29/2013
> 
> **Procedure:** SCP-4618 was transported to Site-56 after the manifestation of the SCP-4618-A instances. Foundation agents would restrain the SCP-4618-A instances from accessing SCP-4618 after school if necessary.
> 
> **Result:** When SCP-4618 exited Brighton High School, the SCP-4618-A instances immediately exited their classrooms without explanation and attempted to follow SCP-4618. Foundation agents successfully detained the SCP-4618-A instances and delivered them to Site-56. The instances were contained in separate humanoid containment chambers. 
> 
> The SCP-4618-A instances violently expressed disapproval regarding the relocation of SCP-4618, and would face towards the location of the vehicle at all times. It is of note that none of the instances were notified of the transfer or the new location of SCP-4618. All instances responded with verbal threats, and refused to cooperate with Foundation personnel.
> 
> At 4:55 PM, SCP-4618 demanifested. At the same time, the instances of SCP-4618-A ceased their violent mannerisms, turned towards Brighton High School, and collapsed. Subsequent autopsies revealed their bodies to be composed of a chalky yellow substance, with the visible skin composed of a soft plastic material. The substance was determined to match the substance extracted during Test 4618-06. 
> 
> SCP-4618 reappeared at Brighton High School at 5:03 PM. On 4/2/2013, three duplicate instances of SCP-4618-A manifested.

> __**Test 4618-08**__
> 
> **Subjects:** SCP-4618-A-1, SCP-4618-A-2, and SCP-4618-A-3
> **Date:** 4/9/2013
> 
> **Procedure:** The SCP-4618-A instances were removed from their classrooms during their lunch period and transported to Site-56 for dissection by Foundation surgeons.
> 
> **Result:** The SCP-4618-A instances were successfully restrained and delivered. During delivery, all instances mentioned the events of Test 4618-07, and vocalized distrust and aggression towards the Foundation. All instances continuously faced in the direction of Brighton High School during their containment. 
> 
> SCP-4618-A-1 was dissected first, and was restrained on a hospital gurney during the procedure. An incision was first made on its stomach area, and a thick yellow substance was excreted. Subsequent incisions were performed on both arms and legs, with similar results. When its "skin" was removed, SCP-4618-A-1 expired. The yellow substance hardened into a chalk-like consistency.
> 
> Dissection of SCP-4618-A-2 was interrupted by its physical resistance to Foundation doctors. A total of four personnel were injured by its attacks. SCP-4618-A-2 underwent emergency termination by security. The bullet holes in its body excreted the yellow substance, which hardened. 
> 
> SCP-4618-A-3 was discovered attempting self-termination by repeated head injury. It was restrained for its own safety, and transported to the dissection room. An incision was made on its forehead, and the yellow substance was excreted. Similar incisions made resulted in the substance exiting its body. When SCP-4618-A-3 expired, the substance did not harden, remaining in a thick liquid state. 
> 
> SCP-4618 successfully performed its afternoon routine without the SCP-4618-A instances.
