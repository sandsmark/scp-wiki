**Item #:** SCP-4000

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4000 is to be kept within a reinforced containment chamber at Isolated Site-12. No entry to the containment chamber is permitted. Isolated Site-12 staff are strictly forbidden from observing SCP-4000. No recording devices are to be present within the containment chamber. All testing is to be denied.

Isolated Site-12 is to be staffed with a single member of personnel at all times. Personnel assigned to Isolated Site-12 are be rotated out and replaced after 60 days on-site. No member of personnel may remain at Isolated Site-12 for more than one consecutive shift.

Isolated Site-12 staff are to submit a full report weekly to their previous Site. [[[aiad-homescreen|Alexandra.aic]]] is to maintain a presence at Isolated Site-12 and monitor outgoing communications to ensure that they are free from details of either Isolated Site-12 or SCP-4000.

Knowledge of the location of Isolated Site-12, and by extension SCP-4000, is strictly need-to-know only. At the end of their shift, Isolated Site-12 staff are to be amnesticated with a Class-B amnestic to remove these details. False memories are to be provided upon request.

Isolated Site-12 staff should resist imagining or hypothesising about the nature of SCP-4000.

**Description:** SCP-4000 is an object, entity or concept that is currently located at Isolated Site-12. It is currently unknown what, if any, anomalous effects SCP-4000 exhibits.

SCP-4000 was discovered on 2010-03-04 in [DATA EXPUNGED], in which Isolated Site-12 was later constructed. Initial containment resulted in the deaths of all civilians who were originally exposed to SCP-4000, both mobile task forces sent, the Foundation operators directing those MTFs via radio, and most other personnel observing operations. Autopsies concluded that those who did not die due to [DATA EXPUNGED] on account of the weather in the region suffered no physical injuries barring minor restructuring of certain parts of the brain[[footnote]]Primarily the medial temporal lobe with most damage localised to the amygdala.[[/footnote]]. Other than these discrepancies -- including several cases in which the restructuring was not present -- pathologists were unable to ascertain any reason for death.

Current containment procedures are the combined result of trial-and-error and preemptive attempts to prevent further loss of life, and have been in place since SCP-4000 was found. No casualties have been attributed to SCP-4000 since then.
