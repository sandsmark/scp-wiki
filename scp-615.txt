**Item #:** SCP-615

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-615 is kept in a secure enclosure constructed of inorganic materials. Under no circumstances is any organic matter, particularly plant matter, to be allowed within SCP-615's enclosure without the approval of a Level 4 researcher. Due to SCP-615's aggressive and territorial nature, personnel are not allowed to enter the enclosure without a security detail armed with incendiary weaponry. 

In the event of a containment breach, personnel are to avoid proximity to SCP-615 until containment teams arrive. Incendiary weaponry must be used to force SCP-615 back into its enclosure. If re-containment is impossible, termination of SCP-615 is authorized.

**Description:** SCP-615 is a sentient collection of dead and discarded plant matter, the majority of which is small sticks and broken branches. Remote scanning revealed a complete lack of any internal organic structures such as organs or a central nervous system. However, SCP-615 is capable of movement, manipulation of the surroundings, and instinctual behavior. It is not known how SCP-615 maintains itself structurally as a single mass of organic detritus, nor is its method of motor function known. Observation has demonstrated that it exhibits locomotion by rolling itself along the ground, covering level terrain with fair rapidity. SCP-615 tends to follow a linear path, splitting temporarily into two or more segments to avoid obstacles. Despite a lack of any visible sensory organs, SCP-615 is able to interpret its surroundings through an unknown process.

Observation of SCP-615 prior to containment revealed that it feeds off of discarded and dead plant matter. SCP-615 prefers to inhabit areas of thick vegetation, such as forests and jungles. It increases its mass through the absorption of discarded plant matter from the ground. SCP-615 also exhibits what has been called a "natural gardening" activity, pruning and trimming living trees of excess plant matter. This serves the dual purpose of feeding SCP-615 and increasing the lifespan of plants in its territory.  It has been observed that SCP-615 can be starved if deprived of plant matter. Researchers have documented the biodegradation of plant material composing SCP-615 if it is forced into extended periods of starvation, shrinking it up to the point of death. If fed in excess, SCP-615 will reach a critical mass at which it is unable to support itself. At this point SCP-615 enters a reproductive stage, separating itself into multiple offspring through fission.

SCP-615 exhibits the behavioral patterns common to territorial predators. It will commonly patrol an area of several square kilometers and aggressively attack any intruders. Though SCP-615 can be easily avoided and outrun, it possesses devastating strength and savagery if it manages to catch its quarry. SCP-615 attacks by engulfing its target and contracting its mass, crushing the victim. Lab tests and eyewitness reports have demonstrated that it is easily capable of crushing objects as large as trucks.

Due to its composition, SCP-615 is extremely flammable, making incendiary weaponry appropriate for containment purposes. SCP-615 is seemingly aware of its weakness and shows a great aversion to flames. Containment is relatively simple, as it will attempt to avoid fire at all costs.

SCP-615 was originally discovered in the █████ Forest after it disrupted logging operations there. Reports of missing loggers and destroyed logging equipment suggested the anomalous nature of the attacks to the Foundation. An exploratory expedition eventually encountered SCP-615, suffering several casualties as a result. A Mobile Task Force was sent in and managed to herd SCP-615 into its current containment with the use of flares and torches.
