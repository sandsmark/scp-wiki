[[/div]]
**Name:** Paul C. Dimaccio

**Security Clearance:** [REDACTED]

**Current Assignment:** Researcher, Site-███[[footnote]][[collapsible show="Access restricted. Level 4/EC and above only." hide="Access granted and logged. Proceed."]]However, Dimaccio is currently attached to the Ethics Committee.[[/collapsible]][[/footnote]]

**Profile:** Researcher Dimaccio was recruited shortly after graduating from the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in 19██. Initially assigned to Foundation security, he distinguished himself in several incidents; as a result, he was subsequently reassigned to MTF service.[[footnote]]Most notably, Dimaccio commanded MTF Theta-90, aka "Angle Grinders", specializing in anomalous geometry / topology and other such spacetime distortions.[[/footnote]]

After Incident [REDACTED], he retired from field duty and successfully petitioned to join the research group of Dr. ██████████████████, who had previously been attached to MTF Theta-90. Beginning as a junior research technician, he was subsequently promoted to Assistant Researcher and then full Researcher. Dimaccio often serves as a de facto Senior Researcher, although his lack of graduate education has hampered official appointment to this role. Nevertheless, as an experienced "retread"[[footnote]]Foundation term, borrowed from the military, to refer to non-scientist field operatives who end up in scientific roles.[[/footnote]], his thoughts and opinions tend to be taken seriously.

**Name:** Dr. Derrick C. Derekson

**Security Clearance:** Level 1

**Current Assignment:** Researcher, Site-19

**Profile (taken from Dr. Derekson's last performance appraisal):**
{{//Dr. Derekson is boorish, rude, egotistical, condescending, childish, convinced of his own superiority and intelligence despite vast evidence to the contrary, ceaselessly dismissive of the efforts of others, and repeatedly files spurious and unscientific entries into the Foundation database.[[footnote]]Examples such as SCP-1125 ("Anomalously Improbable Dice Rolls at ███████ Casino") and SCP-1981 ("Unexplainable Election of Two-Bit Actor to Presidency") have since been expunged from the Foundation's records.[[/footnote]] Further, Derekson frequently claims to have found "a new skip" that will inevitably turn out to be a perfectly ordinary natural phenomenon; when confronted about such behavior, he will insist that his interpretation of events is correct "because it's affecting you and you don't even know it, man".//}}
 
{{//In summary, I have met D-Class who were more suited to the position of Researcher than Dr. Derekson. Unfortunately, due to//}} [REDACTED] {{//and the subsequent fallout, it remains necessary for Dr. Derekson to be employed in the █████████ group for the forseeable future.//}}
