[[tab Initial Investigation]]

Agents Caulfield and McDonald carried out the first visit to 23 Cutts Avenue, Quantico, VA on October 28, 2019 after a series of four anonymous tip offs were made. No access to the premises was granted at this time. The Agents' conversation with Mrs. Haughton is transcribed below.


> **Caulfield:** Hello, ma'am, we're agents from the FBI. There's been reports of strange noises coming from nearby and we were wondering if we could ask you a few questions about it?
> 
> **Mrs. Haughton:** What do you want know?
> 
> **Caulfield:** We have reports of //[pause]// “rattling and hissing” coming from your house.
> 
> **Mrs. Haughton:** During the night?
> 
> **McDonald:** Yes ma'am.
> 
> **Mrs. Haughton:** It sounds like it's just my central heating system? It's been playing up recently and I need it to keep me warm during these cold autumn nights.
> 
> **McDonald:** Where were you on the night of the 19th?
> 
> **Mrs. Haughton:** That was...the Saturday before last?
> 
> **McDonald:** Yes ma'am.
> 
> **Mrs. Haughton:** Hmm //[pause]// I would've been at the //[pause]// opera. Prokofiev's Romeo and Juliet.
> 
> **McDonald:** There was reports of hammering coming from your house at 3am.
> 
> **Mrs. Haughton:** Like I said, my central heating has been acting up. I'm sure it was just the pipes knocking. Is there anything else you want or can I go now?
> 
> **Caulfield:** One last thing: have you seen or felt anyone following you recently?
> 
> **Mrs. Haughton:** I have not.
> 
> **Caulfield:** Thank you for your time, ma'am.

Agents Caulfield and McDonald carried out a brief door to door of the neighboring houses following this but failed to turn up anything relevant. Several rumors of Mrs. Haughton's philandering  were noted, as well as some concern at the youth of her current husband.

A transcript of the audio recording of this dispatch is logged below for posterity.

> //Agent Caulfield knocks on the front door, waits for approximately 30s and then knocks again, louder. Footsteps can be heard within the property//
> 
> **Caulfield:** //[shouted, through door]// Ma'am, we have a warrant to search the premises, please open the door.
> 
> //The footsteps can be heard moving towards the door, followed by the sound of it being unlocked and opened.//
> 
> **Mrs. Haughton:** Can I see the warrant?
> 
> **Caulfield:** Yeah.
> 
> //There's 42s of silence here as Mrs. Haughton reads the warrant.//
> 
> **Mrs. Haughton:** Well, it all seems to be in order; I guess you can come in. Where do you want to start? The basement? Or upstairs?
> 
> **Caulfield:** I'll take the basement; McDonald, you start upstairs. We'll meet up when we're done.
> 
> **Mrs. Haughton:** Uh, please be careful upstairs, I'm currently having some work done. 
> 
> ----
> //Note: Caulfield's investigation has been removed from this record for brevity as it contained no relevant findings. A complete transcript and audio recording is available in File 2019-031-B if required.//
> ----
> 
> //Footsteps can be heard for 15s as Agent McDonald and Mrs. Haughton ascend the stairs to the upper floor and walk down the upper hallway.//
> 
> **McDonald:** I'm at the //[pause]// third door on the left of the hallway. Inside is a bedroom, presumably the master bedroom?
> 
> **Mrs. Haughton:** Yes. Do you have to snoop through all my things?
> 
> **McDonald:** Only if we have reason to believe they're linked to irregular activity.
> 
> **Mrs. Haughton:** I can assure you that no such thing is permitted within my house!
> 
> **McDonald:** Moving on, the second door on the right of the hallway is a //[sound of a door opening]// bathroom. Nothing suspicious there either.
> 
> **Mrs. Haughton:** This next door is where the work is being carried out: do you have to go in there? I don't want you disturbing the renovations.
> 
> **McDonald:** Ma'am, I assure you that I will not disturb anything unnecessarily. I do, however, need to look in there in order to ensure nothing irregular is occurring.
> 
> **Mrs. Haughton:** //[sighs]// Are you sure?
> 
> **McDonald:** Yes ma'am.
> 
> **Mrs. Haughton:** Very well.
> 
> //[The sound of a door being unlocked is audible.]//
> 
> **McDonald:** Fuck.
> 
> **McDonald:** I can see //[pause]// eight heads mounted on the walls. One of them appears to be Mrs. Haughton's current husband. I think they're all trophy husbands?
> 
> **McDonald:** //[shouted]// Caulfield, I need your help up here.

[[tab Bureau Record]]

**Current Status:** The UIU investigation into the property has concluded that the eight mounted heads belong to Mrs. Haughton's former husbands. Traces of DNA from her most recent husband were detected in the furnace in her basement. No other traces of the rest of her husbands' bodies were found.

While the heads appear to respire, neither sapience nor sentience could be identified within them. They are to be kept in Evidence Locker B-19 through B-26, and monitored regularly to ensure the condition of the heads does not deteriorate.

The mechanism used to keep the heads "alive" is currently unknown; and an investigation into the irregular properties of the heads is ongoing.

Investigations into the deaths of her husbands reveals that Mrs. Haughton made several substantial contributions to Police Commissioner Shea's campaign fund over the past 20 years. It's believed that each of these payments corresponds with the disappearance of one of her husbands.

**Crimes:** Eight counts of first degree homicide.

**Sentencing:** Life in prison without parole.
