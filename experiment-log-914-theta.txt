title:Experiment Log 914 Theta
**Experiment Log of:** [[[kain pathos crow s author page |Professor Kain Pathos Crow]]], utilizing [[[SCP-914]]] in obtaining base materials for the "[[[Olympia Project]]]".

**Date:** 05/12/2008

**Pre-Experiment Note:**
This is to produce the base materials I need for the project. I had to reassemble the subject that I was going to originally going to use, because after having a talk with [[[dr gears s personnel file |Dr. Gears]]], I discovered that I would be unable to use the composite part as I had originally intended, and am instead forced to use the entire subject.

++++++ Test-1

**Input:** 
* Caucasian female, thirty six (36) years of age, five (5) foot, ten (10) inches in height, one hundred and forty nine (149) pounds in weight. Subject is in relative good health, although there is some mild liver damage from excessive drinking.

* Ten (10) pounds of [[[SCP-143]]].

**Setting:** Fine

**Output:**
An organism that appeared to be young tree sapling weighing one hundred and fifty nine (159) pounds, the bark being a pale gray color, and the leaves dark brown. Organism maintained an average constant external temperature of thirty seven (37) degrees.

Organism has a limited motor nervous system, although there appeared to be no true central nervous system. Tissue samples extracted from the main trunk, branches and leaves show that the internal tissue of the trunk is similar to brain tissue, only restructured to be much more durable, and with a higher level of conductivity, whereas branches had traces of similar to muscle tissue. The leaves contained a high amount of trichome hairs, which were much longer and thicker than average, being near and inch in length, and a light brown in color. Further examination showed them to be composed primarily of keratin. 

Organism responded much slower to external stimuli than most organisms, taking three hours to register the tissue harvesting done to its main trunk.

Subject has also showed limited signs of sentience, although communication is difficult, due to the slow reaction and movement times of the subject.

**Note:** //While the subject is indeed interesting, and does warrant further examination, it's not what I was looking for. Inter her outside, near the grove, and make sure she's well looked after.//

++++++ Test-2

**Input:**
* Asian female, twenty nine (29) years in age, five (5) foot, three (3) inches in height, one hundred and twenty seven (127) pounds in weight. Subject is in relatively good health. No major medical issues.

*Ten (10) pounds of [[[SCP-143]]].

**Setting:** 1:1

**Output:**
* A solid ten (10) pound block of various compounds that are mainly found within the human body.

* Human female with vaguely Asian features, with the same proportions and weight as the input subject. Skin is light gray, and hair has changed to a slightly translucent pink, similar to the leaves of SCP-143.

Physiology remains mostly the same, although subjects skin has displayed distinct photosynthetic qualities.

**Note:** //This is more along the lines of what I was looking for. Hopefully, the rest of the tests will go similarly to this one.//
