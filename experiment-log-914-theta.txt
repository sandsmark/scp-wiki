title:Experiment Log 914 Theta
**Experiment Log of:** [[[kain pathos crow s author page |Professor Kain Pathos Crow]]], utilizing [[[SCP-914]]] in obtaining base materials for the "[[[Olympia Project]]]".

**Date:** 05/12/2008

**Pre-Experiment Note:**
//This is to produce the base materials I need for the project. I had to reassemble the subject that I was going to originally going to use, because after having a talk with [[[dr gears s personnel file |Dr. Gears]]], I discovered that I would be unable to use the composite part as I had originally intended, and am instead forced to use the entire subject.// - Professor Crow

+++ Test-1

**Input:** 
* Caucasian female, thirty six (36) years of age, five (5) foot, ten (10) inches in height, one hundred and forty nine (149) pounds in weight. Subject is in relative good health, although there is some mild liver damage from excessive drinking.

* Ten (10) pounds of [[[SCP-143]]].

**Setting:** Fine

**Output:**
An organism that appeared to be young tree sapling weighing one hundred and fifty nine (159) pounds, the bark being a pale gray color, and the leaves dark brown. Organism maintained an average constant external temperature of thirty seven (37) degrees.

Organism has a limited motor nervous system, although there appeared to be no true central nervous system. Tissue samples extracted from the main trunk, branches and leaves show that the internal tissue of the trunk is similar to brain tissue, only restructured to be much more durable, and with a higher level of conductivity, whereas branches had traces of similar to muscle tissue. The leaves contained a high amount of trichome hairs, which were much longer and thicker than average, being near and inch in length, and a light brown in color. Further examination showed them to be composed primarily of keratin. 

Organism responded much slower to external stimuli than most organisms, taking three hours to register the tissue harvesting done to its main trunk.

Subject has also showed limited signs of sentience, although communication is difficult, due to the slow reaction and movement times of the subject.

**Note:** //While the subject is indeed interesting, and does warrant further examination, it's not what I was looking for. Inter her outside, near the grove, and make sure she's well looked after.//

+++ Test-2

**Input:**
* Asian female, twenty nine (29) years in age, five (5) foot, three (3) inches in height, one hundred and twenty seven (127) pounds in weight. Subject is in relatively good health. No major medical issues.

* Ten (10) pounds of [[[SCP-143]]].

**Setting:** 1:1

**Output:**
* A solid ten (10) pound block of various compounds that are mainly found within the human body.

* Human female with vaguely Asian features, with the same proportions and weight as the input subject. Skin is light gray, and hair has changed to a slightly translucent pink, similar to the leaves of SCP-143.

Physiology remains mostly the same, although subjects skin has displayed distinct photosynthetic qualities, and tissue has the same basic material properties as SCP-143.

**Note:** //This is more along the lines of what I was looking for. Hopefully, the rest of the tests will go similarly to this one.//

+++ Test-3

**Input:**
* Negro female, thirty two (32) years of age, six (6) foot in height, one hundred and seventy one (171) pounds in weight. Subject is in relative good health. No major medical issues.

* Ten (10) pounds of [[[SCP-148]]].

**Setting:** 1:1

**Output:**
A solid statue of the subject comprised of a combination of SCP-148 and variety of compounds found in the human body, weighing one hundred and eighty one (181) pounds and having the same dimensions as the subject before hand. No life signs.

**Notes:** //Great,// another //lawn ornament. Complete, and total, failure.//

+++ Test-4

**Input:**
* Caucasian female, thirty three (33) years of age, five (5) foot, four (4) inches in height, one hundred and thirty five (135) pounds in weight. Subject is in relative good health. Mild damage to lungs due to excessive smoking.

* Ten (10) pounds of [[[SCP-148]]]

**Setting:** Fine

**Output:**
A large spherical object weighing one hundred and forty five (145) pounds in weight, and one (1) foot in diameter. Object is highly ornate, with raised patterns on the surface, which through further investigation appear to be made of bone. The rest of the exterior is a compound comprised partially of SCP-148 and iron, with traces samples of other elements found within the human body.

Object is slightly warm, being twenty five (25) degrees Celsius on the surface. When a subject is in close physical proximity to the object, subject is capable of seeing "beyond the normal human spectrum of reality" as stated by one subject.This ability increases exponentially when in physical contact with the object. There were no extreme ill effects from this exposure, aside from increasingly severe headaches from prolonged exposure, although this is merited to the inability of the human mind to comprehend such things.

When asked what exactly the subject meant by its previous statement, the subject went on to say that it was possible to "see" thoughts and the "lifeforce" of living organisms. The subject went on to say that he had seen other things which were impossible to explain with words, and that even thinking about them gave him a headache.

**Note:** //Again, interesting, but again, utterly useless to what I'm trying to do.//

+++ Test-5

**Input:**
* Caucasian female, twenty five (25) years of age, five (5) foot three (3) inches in height and one hundred and thirty seven (137) pounds in weight. Subject is in exceptional good health. The subject had been a long distance runner before her incarceration.

* Ten (10) pounds of [[[SCP-148]]].

**Setting:** Fine

**Output:**
Human female, one hundred and forty seven (147) pounds in weight, with the same dimensions as the original subject. Skin has taken on a lightly greenish pallor and has hardened considerable, yet remains somewhat malleable. Tissue has become denser, leading to an increase in physical resilience. It is expected that subject will be resilient to mental attacks and probing as well.

**Notes:** //That's better. That's more along the lines of what I'm looking for.//
