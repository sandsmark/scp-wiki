**Item #:** SCP-027

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-027 is to be kept in a 5 m x 5 m containment cell with a grated, raised floor connected to a strong vacuum system. All creatures removed from SCP-027's containment cell are to be [DATA EXPUNGED]. The cell is to be cleaned and inspected for structural damage daily.

SCP-027 must be monitored by at least two personnel at all times. Any unusual behavior on the part of SCP-027 or the appearance of any unusual species in SCP-027’s vicinity must immediately be reported to Level 4 personnel.

Security personnel assigned to SCP-027 must be inoculated against all known animal-borne pathogens and must be armed with tranquilizer guns, with standing orders to subdue SCP-027 if the need arises.

**Description:** SCP-027 appears to be a Caucasian male in his early to mid-thirties, 168 cm tall with a mass of approximately 50 kg. SCP-027 is unusual in that there is a constant swarming of vermin in his immediate location. SCP-027 is not able to assert control over these creatures in any way, and is occasionally the subject of attacks by feral specimens. Encroaching personnel might be similarly assaulted, should they veer too close to the vermin swarm. 

Wherever SCP-027 goes, an initial swarm of flying insects such as gnats and flies will start to form a cloud around him, usually within two (2) to five (5) minutes. Shortly thereafter, crawling animals (including cockroaches, worms, spiders, mice, and rats) will begin to appear; the longer SCP-027 remains in a location, the more vermin gather there. When SCP-027 leaves a location, some of these creatures will follow, but most will disperse.

Presumably, the constant presence of these animals has played a significant role in SCP-027’s degraded mental health. In addition, evidence of heavy drinking and illicit drug use has been discovered, and SCP-027 shows signs of prolonged sleep deprivation. Thus, communication with SCP-027 is difficult, even when completely removed and isolated from the attracted creatures (the longest known period that SCP-027 has been completely isolated from vermin is █ min ██ sec).

SCP-027 is usually filthy and covered in scratches and bites. Because the constant swarm of vermin will rapidly devour any food presented to it, SCP-027 usually eats quickly and messily, and has been observed scrounging garbage cans for food as well as simply eating some of the creatures that are drawn. To date, SCP-027 has not exhibited more than brief symptoms of any disease caused by an animal-borne pathogen; the source and mechanism of this unusual hardiness are unknown. Also not known are how and why certain animals are drawn to SCP-027, while others remain unaffected.

**Appendix 1: Discovery and Acquisition**

SCP-027 was discovered in an abandoned warehouse outside of ███████, ██, after multiple reports of stench and strange noises from within. Investigators discovered the warehouse completely overrun by rats, mice, roaches, and other vermin, and promptly called in Animal Control and DHEC, tipping off the Foundation in the process. Further investigation found that the animals had come from the surrounding area (which had started to cause a local ecological disaster), and that inside the warehouse, underneath the writhing mass of vermin, was a person. When that person was finally lead outside, the vermin began to follow, prompting agents on the scene to take custody of said person and transport him to Site-██. Class A amnesiacs were administered to all persons at the scene.
