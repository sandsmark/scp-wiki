**Item #:** SCP-4593

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** All samples of SCP-4593 are to be stored within hermetically sealed Foundation-certified steel cylinders. The cylinders should be stored within a vacuum-sealed chamber in Site-77. Personnel with security clearance of Level-3 or higher are permitted to carry out tests involving SCP-4593. Permission is required from personnel with Level-4 clearance if planned testing will use more than 5L of SCP-4593.

**Description:** SCP-4593 is a transparent gaseous mixture. It appears to be composed solely of oxygen, nitrogen and argon in similar amounts to what is found in regular air, however its density is considerably higher than what would be expected from these substances. Testing has concluded that SCP-4593 does not mix with any other substance, including non-anomalous air. Therefore, it cannot be diluted or altered in any way.

SCP-4593 is non-toxic when inhaled. The oxygen in the gas causes it to be successfully breathed by humans, allowing their cells to perform respiration. In addition to the properties expected of regular air, SCP-4593 inhalation also increases several types of intelligence in subjects. Testing has concluded that the gas has a positive effect on logical, mathematical, linguistic, spatial and interpersonal intelligence. Continued exposure to SCP-4593 enhances the effect further, however the increase in intellect displays logarithmic growth. After exhalation, the anomalous properties cease to exist. The gas released is indistinguishable from regular exhaled air.

--As there are no negative side effects, SCP-4593 is being investigated for possible applications which could assist the operation of the foundation. Due to the extremely limited supply (as of ██/██/██13 believed to be enough to sustain one human male for approximately twenty-five days) this investigation is unlikely to lead to wide usage of SCP-4593.-- This investigation has been stopped, see Addendum 4593-B for an updated description.

**Addendum 4593-A: Transferred from D-Class Incident Log 23/07/15**

Between the hours of 0300 and 2300, ██ D-Class personnel expired. The deaths were caused by a combination of extremely rapid malignant tumor growth and massive cerebral haemorrhaging. Despite the fact that 65% of the personnel received medical treatment, every D-Class affected by the symptoms was declared dead within 20 minutes of initial onset.

Initially, autopsies of the subjects did not assist in determining the cause behind the deaths. However, when samples of brain tissue were further analysed by Foundation researchers, cells from every subject appeared to contain large amounts of a compound which remains unidentified. Its origin remains unclear, however all of the D-Class personnel who were affected had previously been involved in the testing of SCP-4593. A test is to be carried out in an attempt to conclude whether or not SCP-4593 was a factor in this incident. 

**Addendum 4593-B: Updated Description 06/08/15**

Further testing concluded that the initial description of SCP-4593 presented several incorrect pieces of information. This issue has been amended using the updated description below:

**Description:** SCP-4593 is a transparent gaseous mixture.

Testing has concluded that SCP-4593 does not mix with any other substance. This includes non-anomalous air. Therefore, it cannot be diluted or altered in any way.

SCP-4593 is ##blue|initially## non-toxic when inhaled. The oxygen in the gas causes it to be successfully breathed by humans, allowing their cells to perform respiration. In addition to the properties expected of regular air, SCP-4593 inhalation also increases several types of intelligence in subjects. Testing has concluded that the gas has a positive effect on logical, mathematical, linguistic, spatial and interpersonal intelligence. Continued exposure to SCP-4593 enhances the effect further, however the increase in intellect displays logarithmic growth. After exhalation, the anomalous properties cease to exist. The gas released is indistinguishable from regular exhaled air.

##blue|After twenty-four cumulative hours without exposure to the gas, SCP-4593 presents a secondary anomalous effect within the subject. Using methods which remain unknown, a chemical is produced by neurons within the brain. This chemical will be referred to as SCP-4593-1. Initially, SCP-4593-1 is only present in extremely small quantities within the brain. However, after what is estimated to be two years of unrestricted production, SCP-4593-1 stimulates extremely rapid tumor growth. This is invariably fatal to subjects, resulting in their deaths within 20 minutes of the first growths appearing.##

##blue|SCP-4593-1 production can be temporarily halted by further inhalation of SCP-4593. This does not reduce the levels within neurons; directly following cessation of exposure SCP-4593-1 production will restart.##

##blue|These properties currently present no risk to Foundation staff. Previous suggestions to intentionally expose researchers to the gas never saw fruition, as the amount of SCP-4593 possessed is not enough to affect a substantial amount of staff. Therefore, nobody employed by the Foundation, with the exception of D-Class personnel, is believed to be under the effects of SCP-4593.##

The results came through for the SCP-4593 testing. Turns out, it did cause the deaths. As of now I have around a week of air left, then two years to figure out how the fuck I get more. Hopefully, the enhancement from SCP-4593 will come in handy.

First, I'll send out an MTF to that shithole we got the air from. Maybe there's still some there, but I'm really grasping at straws. All I wanted was for my brain to work a bit faster. When I was younger, I was always the smartest in my school, but everyone here is just as intelligent as me, if not even more. At least my position as Head Researcher lets me //try// to get some more gas.

The MTF is back. There's no sign of any more SCP-4593 reserves, and I'm on my last few canisters. I know the O5s keep a couple more in secure storage from before they knew it killed people, but they'll never give me them without a reason, and the truth would get me dismissed or tested on. And I can't stress just how bad lying to or stealing from the Overseers would be.

I'm running out of options already. If only I’d waited three more weeks before I started this air.  At least I'll have two years while my brain is a ticking time bomb.

I have maybe one day left of this before it’s gone. Still no ideas for how to fix this shit. The intelligence I'm meant to have really isn't coming in that handy. I don't want to have to take from the Overseers, but if it means possibly surviving for longer, then it might end up happening. 

In other news, but still related, Junior Researcher Bradbury has asked me why I've been 'on edge' lately. I've blamed it on stress, but I can't keep up this facade for ever. At least, if I do die, the next Head Researcher will see what I've had to suffer through.

I ran out of it today. Bradbury is threatening to report me to the Site Director, he says I'm acting unstable. I'm trying to hide it, but if anybody ends up checking SCP-4593's vault then they'll find a ton of empty containers. They'll draw the lines leading to me eventually.

I know what I can try: I'll change the containment procedures to strongly discourage testing. That should fix it. No, no, that's way too conspicuous. At least I've got two years to find a better solution.

FUCK! Site-77's annual inspection is next week. They'll find out everything is gone. I've got two options: fake a containment breach or steal from the overseers. The first option wouldn’t work, SCP-4593 doesn’t diffuse at all. It would just be expected to be all in one place, which can’t happen if it doesn’t exist any more. Stealing from the overseers is a really bad idea, as I’ve mentioned before. It’s a bit of a Catch-22 situation right now.

I’ve got one other option that might be what I have to go with, but morally it’s //DARK// grey. Theoretically, if I was to blame Bradbury for this, it would be his word against mine. And I’m Head Researcher. Yes, they would find out I was lying in two years, but like, I’ll be dead anyway unless I can figure something else out. This is absolutely immoral. This was all my fault in the first place but I do have to at least try to survive. I've got family and friends who need me.

It... worked? Bradbury is undergoing experimentation. I forgot he wouldn’t have any SCP-4593-1 in his brain and almost thought they would smell a rat, but he’s being investigated as an exception to the normal symptoms. All the things he said while being detained (which were actually completely true) are being put down as symptoms related to his exposure and his acceptance that his life is limited.

I feel sick to the stomach about it all, but in my head it was the right thing to do. I’ve got a family who need me. Anyway, I’m being given another anomaly to work with, so my entries here will be less frequent, at least until I get closer to the end.

Not much has happened in the last few months relating to SCP-4593. It’s been decided (by me) that it’s not having its class changed to Neutralized, as there’s that stuff the Overseers keep secretly. Talking about that stuff, I’ve decided I won’t go out without at least trying to get that. It’s probably only an extra couple of days, but I’ll be really fucking desperate when it’s nearly my time to go. I can’t just let myself slip away without any resistance.

Bradbury is back out. Shit. They couldn’t find any reason why he wouldn’t react the same as everyone else when exposed to the gas. But after almost a year of near-constant experimentation, he’s kind of unstable and desperate to expose me for what I did. He’s going to have to be removed if I want to keep up this masquerade. But how to make it look like it’s not my fault? I’m going to have to fake a suicide; it can be blamed on his time in solitary confinement.

Bradbury is dead. His fingerprints were on the gun. But my morality is gone too. Poor guy, why did I do this to him? He had so much longer to live, and I have a year left. But he’s not me, and he doesn’t have my family. This is awful, looking at his bleeding corpse really hurt my soul. At least I can only live with myself for a bit longer, whether I want to or not.

But I can’t just let it happen. I want my kids to have a dad for as long as possible. Anything that will delay it is something I will consider.

It’s struck me recently how little time I’ve got left. It’s really fucking with my head, but no therapy or anything would work because I can’t tell anyone the truth. How long is it really? Like, ten months? Oh my god, it’s really ruining my sleep: most nights I dream about my head exploding. I scream in pain as my brain, riddled with tumors, leaks out of my bleeding head as everything fades away. Even though I know it’s not real, I wake up sweating. How is the pain so real? I just want to rest.

I need the stuff the Overseers keep. It would let me get at least a few hours of rest. I can’t live with this many sleepless nights. Whatever it takes to get that gas, I'll fucking do it.

I’m planning the heist. It’s going to be on Christmas when they are less likely to notice. I know where they keep it in storage. Now, how to get it out? Do I need to get it out? Why do that when I can stay near it, breathe the beautiful air, keep me alive. I need it. I need it for my family. All for them. I can’t access this in their storage. If I’m not back, the guards caught me. I've got a gun on me, murder doesn't feel as bad any more. They're all going for a good cause and it's definitely worth it. For the greater good.

I found it. I found the elixir. It was great. It’s gone now. What did I delay death for? 5 days? It was worth it. I got the best sleep I’ve ever had on the cold concrete floor. Good thing they don’t have any security camera on that vault: nobody is meant to know it exists. Hopefully the corpses don't give them any clues to what happened. Or the urine. They don't give a shit about anyone so they will never notice. But me, I do care about what's important. I do.

The sleeping pills are working. But I’m pretty reliant on them now. And I don’t like this addiction. I’ve managed to avoid addiction all my life and now sleeping pills are the thing I’m reliant on? At least there’s nothing else. No hardcore drugs or anything. But my time left here is months. I would do anything to get more SCP-4593. There's no way though. It just doesn't exist any more.

I killed people, I robbed people, I slept in a fucking storage vault with a ton of canisters of compressed air. And all for nothing. There’s 3 months left and it’s coming faster and faster.

I FOUND IT! There’s one more canister of it, one more big steel tube of goodness. Yes, it only lasts a couple hours, but I’ve got a better plan. I’m going to ask some of the Junior Researchers to divert all their attention to this stuff and what makes it tick. I’m going to make more. I’m going to live.

The researchers said no. They said it hadn’t worked before, so why would it work now? Maybe they’re right, but they can’t disobey me. I’m in charge and I need the air, so they need to try their very fucking best to get me it. I can’t report this higher up, because we officially stopped the investigation into SCP-4593. I need to find a way. There’s one, but I’m not quite desperate enough. Not yet.

Ali, the new guy who  I'd chosen to look after SCP-4593's cylinder, is out cold on the floor and nobody will believe his side of the story. It was inevitable. It felt good, but I had to stop myself. I need it for research. I need to make more. I want to live. For me. I don’t want to die. I'm important.
