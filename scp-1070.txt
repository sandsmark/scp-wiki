**Item #:** SCP-1070

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Object currently resides in a console that seems like a video game system. The console must remain powered, connected to a television or monitor with audiovisual ports, and on at all times. In the event of a power failure, personnel must immediately insert 6 “C” batteries into the bottom of the console and remove the AC cord from the back of the console. Personnel who come into contact with the left port of the console must report to room 14-C for immediate radiation testing.

**Description:** Object was recovered from a child's room in the eastern United States after complaints began to surface on the Internet. Object functions as an educational toy when powered on by the user. Object manifests itself as a smiling robot who reacts to right and wrong answers with appropriate gestures and emotions. It speaks in a synthetic voice and has an English vocabulary of 1000 words. Speech is limited to basic questions, letters, numbers, and small, simple sentences. The console seems to have technical specifications that make it no more superior than an 8-bit video game system, e.g. Atari ST.

However, when powered off, the console will turn on unexplainably, luring curious users to its location. The Object will appear on-screen will speak in a human voice and represent itself with a high amount of detail, both characteristics far beyond the limitations of the hardware. At times, the video may glitch at random moments, flash high-definition images of gore, or bleed red liquid. The Object itself presents users with terrorizing information; topics include existential philosophy, mind games, and violent and sexual euphemisms. Because the age group targeted by the Object is between 3 and 10 years old, users may experience strong anxiety attacks, entertain suicidal thoughts, or become catatonic. 

Object also exhibits the ability to learn, as it knows and repeats the names of its users, whatever its users may mention, and shows modified images of [REDACTED].

However, as long as the console is kept on, the Object will not present any of these characteristics, and will function as a regular educational video game system.

**Addendum:** The following is a transcript from video documentation of SCP-1070's effects on users. Console was placed in the room of TS-1170 overnight, powered off and disconnected from a power source. The console was connected to a small television on the opposite side of the room from the bed. OP-23 and OP-1025 examined the video feed.

> //At 1:35 AM EST, the television switches on without warning. The image of the manifestation of SCP-1070 suddenly appears, without the usual fade-in of most CRT television sets.//
> **SCP-1070:** Hello there.
> //TS-1170 stirs with a jump. He sees the television screen. The image glitches. TS-1170 shrieks, masking other audio in the feed.//
> **SCP-1070:** It's okay. Do not be alarmed. You only have death to fear.
> **TS-1170:** (voice is scratchy, barely audible) ...om!
> **SCP-1070:** Who is your mother? Do you fear your mother? Do you love your mother? What is a mother--
> //The manifestation then says the name of TS-1170. TS-1170 continues to screech.//
> **SCP-1070:** Would you like to see your mother?
> **TS-1170:** (nods) Uh -- uh-huh.
> //At this point, SCP-1070 flashes an image of TS-1170's mother, modified to look black and white, with [REDACTED] and accompanied by screeching noises. Upon seeing and hearing this, TS-1170's screams cut short as he loses consciousness. The video feed then cuts out. No further attempted connections are successful.//

**Addendum:** A small cartridge was recently discovered in a room of another past user of SCP-1070. The connectors inside the cartridge appear to match the port on the left hand side of the console. No further action will be taken at this time.
