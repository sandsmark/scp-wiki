**Item #:** SCP-1070

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Personnel must keep frequent watch over SCP-1070. The current container for SCP-1070 is a console that seems like a video game system. The console must remain powered, connected to a television or monitor with audiovisual ports, and on at all times. In the event of a power failure, personnel must immediately insert 6 “C” batteries into the bottom of the console and remove the AC cord from the back of the console. Personnel who come into contact with the left port of the console must report to room 14-C for immediate radiation testing.

**Description:** SCP-1070 is a manifestation of software meant to educate young children in math, vocabulary and music. Its container is grey in color and not larger than a shoebox. There is an indentation meant to hold a wireless keyboard, which currently sits on top of the console. There are two ports on the back of the console for connecting to power and video, and one slot on both the left and right sides of the console. The slot on the left side of the console currently remains empty. On the right side, a cartridge with a red label and white text that reads "TALKING" remains in the slot. A window on top of the console allows the user to look at the front of the cartridge. SCP-1070 is currently connected to a 19'' standard-definition color television via composite video and audio cables.

The object functions as an educational toy when powered on by the user. According to Document 1070-B██, it manifests itself as a smiling robot who reacts to right and wrong answers with appropriate gestures and emotions. It speaks in a synthetic voice and has an English vocabulary of 1000 words. Speech is limited to basic questions, letters, numbers, and small, simple sentences. The console seems to have technical specifications that make it comparable to an 8-bit video game system, e.g. The Nintendo entertainment system.

However, when powered off, the console will turn on inexplicably, luring curious users to its location. The manifestation of SCP-1070 will appear on-screen. During this time, it will speak in a human voice and represent itself with a high amount of detail, both characteristics far beyond the limitations of the hardware. At times, the video may glitch at random moments, flash high-definition images of gore, or bleed red liquid. SCP-1070 itself presents users with terrorizing information; topics include existential philosophy, mind games, and violent and sexual euphemisms. Because the age group targeted by SCP-1070 is between 3 and 10 years old, users may experience strong anxiety attacks, entertain suicidal thoughts, or become catatonic. 

Document 1070-B██ claims that the manifestation also exhibits the ability to learn, as it knows and repeats the names of its users, whatever its users may mention, and shows modified images of [REDACTED].

However, as long as the console is kept on, SCP-1070 will not present any of these characteristics, and will function as a regular educational video game system.

The console was recovered from a child's room in the eastern United States after complaints about its functions began to surface on blogging website Parenting.com.

**Addendum:** The following is a transcript from video documentation of SCP-1070's effects on users. Console was placed in the room of TS-1170 overnight, powered off and disconnected from a power source. The console was connected to a small television on the opposite side of the room from the bed. OP-23 and OP-1025 examined the video feed.

> //At 1:35 AM EST, the television switches on without warning. The image of the manifestation of SCP-1070 suddenly appears, without the usual fade-in of most CRT television sets.//
> **SCP-1070:** Hello there.
> //TS-1170 stirs with a jump. He sees the television screen. The image remains static for thirty seconds. Then it glitches, followed by digital audio noise. TS-1170 pulls the covers up to his mouth and shrieks once.//
> **SCP-1070:** It's okay. Do not be alarmed. You only have death to fear.
> **TS-1170:** (voice is scratchy, barely audible) ...om?
> **SCP-1070:** Who is your mother? Do you fear your mother? Do you love your mother? What is a mother--
> //The manifestation then says the name of TS-1170. TS-1170 remains silent.//
> **SCP-1070:** Would you like to see your mother?
> **TS-1170:** (nods) Uh -- uh-huh.
> //At this point, SCP-1070 flashes an image of TS-1170's mother, modified to look black and white, with [REDACTED] and accompanied by screeching noises. Upon seeing and hearing this, TS-1170 screams for ten seconds, then passes out from fatigue. Vital signs show that he is still conscious. His pulse peaks at 235 beats per minute. The video feed then cuts out. No further attempted connections are successful.//

**Addendum:** A small cartridge was recently discovered in a room of another past user of SCP-1070. The connectors inside the cartridge appear to match the port on the left hand side of the console. No further action will be taken at this time.
