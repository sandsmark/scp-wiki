Had this idea yesterday and just decided to follow through (despite a terrible cold I'm currently recovering from). It's Rudolf the Red Nosed Reindeer! Only not at all that.

Happy Holidays and thanks to everyone who listened before I posted!

> This is Dr. Cimmerian, and this is document 55-C-13. I am attempting to recall information relating to uh... SCP-055. Now. I remember that it is... uh... shit. Ok. Well that's pretty much what we expected. It seems like we can't talk about it and we can't write about it.
> 
> Though... Actually. I wonder if we could sing about it.
> 
> It's worth a shot...
> 
> Um... Well it's Christmas.
> 
> "You know Statues and Lizards and
> Eldritch Places,
> Reality shapers,
> And endless staircases,
> But do you recall.
> The most dangerous item of all.
> 
> SCP Fifty Five is,
> Impossible to describe,
> What was I gonna say next?
> Oh right Fifty Five.
> 
> All of the other objects,
> Are dangerous in their own way,
> The thing about this one is that...
> What was I about to say?
>  
> Shit.
> 
> Despite foggy memories,
> I know it's not a sphere,
> We can remember what it's not,
> But not a sphere is all we've got,
> 
> And this you simply must know,
> If it ever does get out,
> SCP Fifty Five will...
> Wait. What was I talking about?"
> 
> Oh. God damn it. //End Log//.[[/collapsible]]
