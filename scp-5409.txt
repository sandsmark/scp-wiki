++++ **__Description__**
[[include :scp-sandbox-3:image-zoom name=pac|caption=An SCP-5409-1 instance.|width=70px|align=right]]
SCP-5409 is a sweet birch tree (//Betula lenta//) with a total of 200 abnormal growths resembling pacifiers (SCP-5409-1). SCP-5409-1 instances have the physical appearance and texture of hard plastic and rubber, but are composed of a previously unknown organic polymer. The faux-rubber "nipple" on each SCP-5409-1 instance is filled with a liquid compound consisting of sap, water, fat, proteins, and lactose. Growth analysis indicates that all 200 SCP-5409-1 instances grew over an estimated 24-hour period during September or October of 2012.

++++ **__Discovery__**
SCP-5409 was discovered on 2013/04/20, by a hiker on the Big Heat Trail in South Mills, Arkansas. The hiker posted detailed pictures of SCP-5409 and a video of himself picking and dissecting an SCP-5409-1 instance to his Facebook account, which were subsequently flagged and removed by WebCrawler 0/FB-44. Assets within the Arkansas State Police were able to verify the anomalous nature of SCP-5409, and cordoned off the area until Foundation personnel could arrive.

A Foundation botanical containment team was dispatched to exhume and transport SCP-5409 to Site-51. During this process, the skeletal remains of a one to seven day old infant male was found entangled in the roots of SCP-5409. The degraded remains of a wicker basket and cotton sheet were also recovered from the roots. A small non-organic pacifier matching the physical appearance of SCP-5409-1 was discovered near the remains.

A small envelope was located in the wicker basket; though the index card within was degraded, the following hand-written message was deciphered through analysis:
