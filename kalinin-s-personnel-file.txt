title:Kalinin's Author Page
My name is Carlos Ray Kalinin. I write for the SCP Foundation, of which I have been a member since 2012. I also serve as a critic, both of finished works and in the draft review process. I occasionally post things related to those pursuits on my Twitter feed, [*https://twitter.com/KalininSCP @KalininSCP]. 

I have contributed the following articles to the site:

**FAQs**

//Q. May I use your works in a tale/article that I'm writing?//

A. Yes. I have a blanket policy of allowing my works to be appropriated elsewhere. Not that any author has the ability to do otherwise, but it's not necessary to ask me if you wish to do so. 

//Q. Will you take a look at this draft/article?//

A. Yes. PM me, and I'll get to your draft within a few days, usually.

//Q. Why are you here if you hate everything?//

A. Contrary to popular belief, I don't hate anything that I read on the site. I'm here because I love writing and reading quality fiction. I care deeply about writing as a medium and I believe it's worth doing well. Therefore, I dispense honest feedback, and expect the same in return.
