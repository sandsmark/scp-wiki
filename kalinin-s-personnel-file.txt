title:Kalinin's Author Page
My name is Carlos Ray Kalinin. I write for the SCP Foundation, of which I have been a member since 2012. I also serve as a critic, both of finished works and in the draft review process. I occasionally post things related to those pursuits on my Twitter feed, [*https://twitter.com/KalininSCP @KalininSCP]. 

My works:

|||||| **Series I** ||
|| [[[SCP-186]]] || **To End All Wars** || My most famous article to date, and highest rated by far. Look for references in SCP-2275 and SCP-2888. ||
|| [[[SCP-255]]] || **Base Eleven Disorder** || Started out as the disembodied head of Laika the Space Dog. How far it's come. I may do something yet with that concept. ||
|| [[[SCP-356]]] || **Autointerrogation** || My entry in the "being fucked with by yourself" trope. ||
|| [[[SCP-480]]] || **Recurring Nightmare Field** || Was intended as the article describing a then-unnamed skip in Guiser's Night. Taught me how hard it is to write dreams from a clinical perspective. This one is first on the list of rewrite candidates. ||
|| [[[SCP-518]]] || **The Transinformational Tomb of Asa Rutledge** || I wanted to write about something on the internet that did creepy shit to you when you read it, but then realized no, I didn't want to do that. This is what I did instead. Back when exploration logs were more in vogue. ||
|| [[[SCP-655]]] || **Biological Disinformation Campaign** || When I flesh out my vision for Grays in the SCPVerse someday, this will be more important. ||
|| [[[SCP-736]]] || **The Iapetus Anomaly** || This one enjoys a pretty good reputation, almost entirely due to the efforts of [[*user Anborough]]. I think it's a decent article, but it's a good lesson in how high ratings can be attained through relentless pimping. ||
|| [[[SCP-986]]] || **Faulkner's Last Manuscript** || The other literature nerds thought this actually sounded like something Faulkner would write, possibly the highest praise I've received on the wiki. This is one of my favorites. ||
|||||| **Series II** ||
|| [[[SCP-1097]]] || **Liquefied Empath** || Created specifically to be The Final Boss at the end of the Strangers of Site-17 series. Someday I'll get around to doing that. ||
|| [[[SCP-1166]]] || **Perfect Lab Specimen** || Yes, I wrote a Talking Animal. My second article, and it shows. I like to think that it's what ultimately became of Remy from //Ratatouille//. ||
|| [[[SCP-1229]]] || **Thirty-Seven Films Starring Lana Neal** || Another of my personal favorites. Lana is a series of images that refuse to leave my head, and one of the few times I allow dream-logic to knowingly penetrate my writing. ||
|| [[[SCP-1377]]] || **Automaton Parliament** || The Uncanny Valley is fertile land indeed. ||
|| [[[SCP-1484]]] || **Murder Diary** || My very first attempt at an article. Kind of creaky, and the original plan is that this was a probe from outer space. Maybe that would have been better. I dunno. ||
|| [[[SCP-1538]]] || **Instructions to a Twin-Screw Extruder** || As an idea, one of my favorites. Another one from the Age of Exploration (Logs), and will likely see some edits in the near future to modernize it a bit. ||
|| [[[SCP-1659]]] || **Directorate K** || Don't ever trust your subconscious. I had the phrase "Directorarte K" rattling around in my skull for weeks, and it eventually transmogrified into this. Turns out that I had read about internal KGB divisions and that this is a term that already means something. God damn it. That's okay, though, because there's a good reason for this. More soon. ||
|| [[[SCP-1709]]] || **Human Fetus Composite** || Basically an excuse to write a scene where a dead fetus laughs for hours at its own not-funny joke. ||
|| [[[SCP-1840]]] || **A Persistent Corpse** || Basically an excuse to write something that has a Medium Security Morgue in it. ||
|| [[[SCP-1984]]] || **Dead Hand** || It's showing its age, but I still like this one. I feel pretty proud that, as scary as the real Dead Hand is, this still found an audience. ||

**FAQs**

//Q. May I use your works in a tale/article that I'm writing?//

A. Yes. I have a blanket policy of allowing my works to be appropriated elsewhere. Not that any author has the ability to do otherwise, but it's not necessary to ask me if you wish to do so. 

//Q. Will you take a look at this draft/article?//

A. Yes. PM me, and I'll get to your draft within a few days, usually.

//Q. Why are you here if you hate everything?//

A. Contrary to popular belief, I don't hate anything that I read on the site. I'm here because I love writing and reading quality fiction. I care deeply about writing as a medium and I believe it's worth doing well. Therefore, I dispense honest feedback, and expect the same in return.
