|||||| **Series I** ||
|| [[[SCP-186]]] || **To End All Wars** || My most famous article to date, and highest rated by far. Look for references in SCP-2275 and SCP-2888. ||
|| [[[SCP-255]]] || **Base Eleven Disorder** || Started out as the disembodied head of Laika the Space Dog. How far it's come. I may do something yet with that concept. ||
|| [[[SCP-356]]] || **Autointerrogation** || My entry in the "being fucked with by yourself" trope. ||
|| [[[SCP-480]]] || **Recurring Nightmare Field** || Was intended as the article describing a then-unnamed skip in Guiser's Night. Taught me how hard it is to write dreams from a clinical perspective. This one is first on the list of rewrite candidates. ||
|| [[[SCP-518]]] || **The Transinformational Tomb of Asa Rutledge** || I wanted to write about something on the internet that did creepy shit to you when you read it, but then realized no, I didn't want to do that. This is what I did instead. Back when exploration logs were more in vogue. ||
|| [[[SCP-655]]] || **Biological Disinformation Campaign** || When I flesh out my vision for Grays in the SCPVerse someday, this will be more important. ||
|| [[[SCP-736]]] || **The Iapetus Anomaly** || This one enjoys a pretty good reputation, almost entirely due to the efforts of [[*user Anborough]]. I think it's a decent article, but it's a good lesson in how high ratings can be attained through relentless pimping. ||
|| [[[SCP-986]]] || **Faulkner's Last Manuscript** || The other literature nerds thought this actually sounded like something Faulkner would write, possibly the highest praise I've received on the wiki. This is one of my favorites. ||
|||||| **Series II** ||
|| [[[SCP-1097]]] || **Liquefied Empath** || Created specifically to be The Final Boss at the end of the Strangers of Site-17 series. Someday I'll get around to doing that. ||
|| [[[SCP-1166]]] || **Perfect Lab Specimen** || Yes, I wrote a Talking Animal. My second article, and it shows. I like to think that it's what ultimately became of Remy from //Ratatouille//. ||
|| [[[SCP-1229]]] || **Thirty-Seven Films Starring Lana Neal** || Another of my personal favorites. Lana is a series of images that refuse to leave my head, and one of the few times I allow dream-logic to knowingly penetrate my writing. ||
|| [[[SCP-1377]]] || **Automaton Parliament** || The Uncanny Valley is fertile land indeed. ||
|| [[[SCP-1484]]] || **Murder Diary** || My very first attempt at an article. Kind of creaky, and the original plan was to make it a probe from outer space. Maybe that would have been better. I dunno. ||
|| [[[SCP-1538]]] || **Instructions to a Twin-Screw Extruder** || As an idea, one of my favorites. Another one from the Age of Exploration (Logs), and will likely see some edits in the near future to modernize it a bit. ||
|| [[[SCP-1659]]] || **Directorate K** || Don't ever trust your subconscious. I had the phrase "Directorate K" rattling around in my skull for weeks, and it eventually transmogrified into this. Turns out that I had read about internal KGB divisions and that this is a term that already means something. God damn it. That's okay, though, because there's a good reason for this. More soon. ||
|| [[[SCP-1709]]] || **Human Fetus Composite** || Basically an excuse to write a scene where a dead fetus laughs for hours at its own not-funny joke. ||
|| [[[SCP-1840]]] || **A Persistent Corpse** || Basically an excuse to write something that has a Medium Security Morgue in it. ||
|| [[[SCP-1984]]] || **Dead Hand** || It's showing its age, but I still like this one. I feel pretty proud that, as scary as the real Dead Hand is, this still found an audience. ||
|||||| **Series III** ||
|| [[[SCP-2003]]] || **Preferred Option** || My entry from the storied 2000 contest. This one seems to have found a bit of a following off-site. Not sure how I feel about that. Initially predicated upon just how fucking creepy the BigDog robot is. ||
|| [[[SCP-2188]]] || **Life and Times of Joaqu√≠n Pablo Izquierdo de San Felipe** || We owe more to Borges than Lovecraft. I wrote this accordingly. ||
|| [[[SCP-2275]]] || **Where Muses Go** || Written initially as someone's gift for the 2014 Christmas Exchange, which led in a convoluted manner to doing a Bright Challenge. Contains my only visual art contribution to the wiki to date. ||
|| [[[SCP-2888]]] || **Again and Again and Again** || I had a draft that was nothing but the title "237 Marys". I've always wanted to write a serial killer article. The two concepts somehow became merged. [[*user Crayne]] contributed the neat little coding at the end, for which I owe him three murders. ||
|| [[[SCP-2911]]] || **Mikio, a Fisherman** || A project for the Short Works Contest. It affected enough people in the way that I intended that I consider it a success. ||
|||||| **Tales** ||
|||| [[[Faith of the Foundation]]] || There was a thread once, long ago, on what religion Foundation operatives followed. For whatever reason, that inspired this. || 
|||| [[[Guiser's Night]]] || A tale written for the 2012 Halloween Contest, back in the days when Gears roamed the Earth and curb stomped you when he entered contests. ||
|||| [[[I, Autarch]]] || Runner-up to the fantastic [[[Mission Statement]]], written by [[*user Dr Reach]], in the Dystopia Contest. I will neither confirm nor deny the supposed cameo that takes place in that tale. Also, I like the idea in the comments that this was how AM got started. ||
|||| [[[Lana Neal Sings the Blues]]] || This is the kind of fiction I like writing best. I might not necessarily lead the way, but I believe that more universal, humanist narratives are what will guide us closer to being a writing site of real import someday. ||
|||| [[[Pseudohistorical Mischief]]] || An //Animal House// pastiche that was my present to [[*user Eskobar]] for the 2012 Christmas Exchange. Bet you're sorry for asking for Alexylva material now, Eskobar. ||
|||| [[[Stars Over Misty Veil]]] || This didn't end up including the sex scene that I wanted in it. Still, writing is, in large part, writing about relationships between people, and in that sense I am pleased with how this turned out. ||
|||| [[[Strangers of Site-17 | Strangers of Site-17: 105]]] || A response to a challenge issued by [[*user Roget]] to write a tale incorporating your two least favorite skips, back when I believed in doing such things. Iris attempts to off herself to the apparent delight of a good chunk of the then-readership. ||
|||| [[[Strangers of Site-17 Part Two | Strangers of Site-17: 343]]] || I already explained in the relevant discussion thread, in great detail, why I think 343 is fucking stupid, so I won't do it again here. This is the beginnings of an attempt to make that article into something not quite as stupid, or at least not reinforce the "lol God is a literal dude who hangs out with us" thing. ||
|||| [[[strangers of site 17 part three | Strangers of Site-17: Hayakawa]]] || Someone was all like "hey I like this series please write more of it," and then I said "okay here's a site director taking a bunch of drugs and calling the O5 Council." Eventually I will finish this because I have moral objections to leaving cliffhangers, but it's a long ways off. This was originally planned to end in a sword fight between Clef and 343, because at that time it had actually been a while since SSAAs had showed up, and hey, Iris and 343 are already here so why not. Then some stuff happened and yeah, this is going in a different direction. ||
|||||| **Tales for [[[the-coldest-war-hub|The Coldest War]]] Canon** ||
|||| [[[The Woodvale Incident]]] || An extremely belated entry meant to kick off the canon. The Foundation at war has always intrigued me as a concept. So why not make it "The Foundation at war with everyone." ||
|||||| **Tales for the [[[learning-the-alphabet-hub| Learning the Alphabet]]] Series** ||
|||| [[[Nazi Nonsense]]] || Years ago, [[*user TwistedGears]] asked me if I would write an interlude for his then-young Learning the Alphabet series. Since I cannot help but be amused at the antics of Aldon and Finnegan (I've tried not being amused, it doesn't work), I agreed. Never let it be said that I do not keep my word. Sometimes, though, it requires putting Groucho Marx in a concentration camp. 
|||| [[[Nondescript Nose]]] || In hindsight, perhaps having Hitler be gang-raped by a pack of ostriches was a bridge too far. The rest of it I leave untouched to a monument that I am capable of goofy-ing the fuck out of things if need be. ||
|||||| **Essays** ||
|||| [[[metacritique-one | Metacritique 1: The Critic's Duty]]] || Listen up you primitive screwheads. ||
|||| [[[metacritique-two | Metacritique 2: Anomalous Art]]] || I will fight until my last breath against the notion that art is for the pretentious and the stupid. Fuck that. || 


**FAQs**

//Q. May I use your works in a tale/article that I'm writing?//

A. Yes. I have a blanket policy of allowing my works to be appropriated elsewhere. Not that any author has the ability to do otherwise, but it's not necessary to ask me if you wish to do so. 

//Q. Will you take a look at this draft/article?//

A. Yes. PM me, and I'll get to your draft within a few days, usually.

//Q. Why are you here if you hate everything?//

A. Contrary to popular belief, I don't hate anything that I read on the site. I'm here because I love writing and reading quality fiction. I care deeply about writing as a medium and I believe it's worth doing well. Therefore, I dispense honest feedback, and expect the same in return.
