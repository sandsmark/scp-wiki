**Item #:** SCP-3129

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3129 is to be kept in a typical 9m x 7m "cubicle" environment during daytime hours. Cleaning crews are to be dispatched once a week to clean daytime enclosure and remove spontaneously-generated masses of Red Bull cans. SCP-3129 is to be kept in a standard humanoid contaimnent cell at all other times. 

Twice a day, SCP-3129 is to receive a standard ration of Purina^^TM^^ Bastard Chow and a dog bowl of water. Each Halloween, which it claims to observe as a "super-important religious holiday or something", SCP-3129 is permitted two cigarettes, a taco, and a handful of Reese's Pieces. 

**Description:** SCP-3129 is a male humanoid, appearing to be 31 years of age (although the subject's mental state has been estimated as significantly more infantile). SCP-3129 refers to itself as "Kalinin", and was known by this pseudonym in several internet-based communities prior to containment. 

Despite no known connections to or knowledge of the Foundation, SCP-3129 has claimed to be the source of several other SCPs currently in containment. These objects include:

[[[SCP-1166]]] - Perfect Lab Specimen
[[[SCP-1377]]] - Automaton Parliament
[[[SCP-1484]]] - Murder Diary
[[[SCP-1709]]] - Human Fetus Composite
[[[SCP-1984]]] - Dead Hand

In addition, SCP-3129 has also claimed authorship of the following field reports:

[[[Faith of the Foundation]]]
[[[Strangers of Site-17]]]
[[[Strangers of Site-17 Part Two]]]

How SCP-3129 obtained detailed information on these subjects is currently unknown; when questioned, SCP-3129 attributed its knowledge to its habit of repeatedly watching //Eraserhead// instead of sleeping. Research into SCP-3129's anomalous properties and inexplicable knowledge is ongoing. 

**Interview 3129-1:** //The following interview between Dr. Holtzman and SCP-3129 was conducted on 07/09/2012 in Holding Room 3C at Site-17://

> **Dr. Holtzman:** I'm going to ask you now about your knowledge of various SCPs contained elsewhere in Foundation custody. 
> 
> **SCP-3129:** Go for it. 
> 
> **Dr. Holtzman:** How did you first become aware of [[[SCP-1166]]]?
> 
> **SCP-3129:** You ever see that movie //Ratatouille//?
> 
> **Dr. Holtzman:** Yes, it was sufficiently entertaining, though the best Pixar movie is still [DATA EXPUNGED]. 
> 
> **SCP-3129:** Well, I thought to myself, "what if instead of an intelligent rat with culinary aspirations in Paris, you had an intelligent, immortal rat in a lab that gets experimented upon repeatedly?" Comedy goldmine. I've already contacted some people about licensing for plushies and t-shirts.
> 
> **Dr. Holtzman:** Fascinating. And [[[SCP-1377]]]?
> 
> **SCP-3129:** Do you consider youself, a...believer, in democracy, Doctor?
> 
> **Dr. Holtzman:** I'm not discussing politics with you again. We had to requisition an entire replacement crate of horse tranquilizers after that episode.
> 
> **SCP-3129:** No, no, it's not like that. No, see, I know of a place, a beautiful utopia, where our fates are determined by rubbery mockeries of humanity, with soulless, dead eyes. They send me voter guides every year. Would you like one?
> 
> **Dr. Holtzman:** No thanks. What about [[[SCP-1484]]]?
> 
> **SCP-3129:** I really liked those "Choose Your Own Adventure" books as a kid. But the disappointing thing about them was that nothing bad ever happened to you in real life if you got a bad ending. While I thought it would be kind of cheesy to have the book literally kill you, I tried to make something even better: A book that lets you re-experience a horrible, violent death, any time you want! Doesn't that sound awesome?
> 
> **Dr. Holtzman:** SCP-1484 has put several researchers in the medical bay due to D-Class reacting violently to its anomalous effects.
> 
> **SCP-3129:** Yeah, people didn't react to that one quite the way I'd hoped. 
> 
> **Dr. Holtzman:** Tell me about [[[SCP-1709]]]. 
> 
> **SCP-3129:** This old lady I see at the supermarket will say "hi" to me sometimes. So I wondered, "what if she barfed up fetuses that said 'hi' to me instead? That would be kind of funny." The rest is history. 
> 
> **Dr. Holtzman:** Mmmhmm. And you claim to be the creator of [[[SCP-1984]]]?
> 
> **SCP-3129:** Dude. Give me some credit. I mean, I'm not delusional, I know that I'm not some dead Russian scientist or something. I'm just the guy who revealed its existence to the world. By the way, you may want to steer clear of the entirety of the Earth during the next Russian election.
> 
> **Dr. Holtzman:** That will be all, SCP-3129. 
> 
> **SCP-3129:** Cool. Can I have my internet connection back?
> 
> **Dr. Holtzman:** No. 
>
