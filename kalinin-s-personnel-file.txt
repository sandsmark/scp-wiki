title:Kalinin's Personnel File
**Item #:** SCP-3129

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3129 is to be kept in a typical 9m x 7m "cubicle" environment during daytime hours. Cleaning crews are to be dispatched once a week to clean daytime enclosure and remove spontaneously-generated masses of Red Bull cans. SCP-3129 is to be kept in a standard humanoid contaimnent cell at all other times. 

Twice a day, SCP-3129 is to receive a standard ration of Purina^^TM^^ Bastard Chow and a dog bowl of water. Each Halloween, which it claims to observe as a "super-important religious holiday or something", SCP-3129 is permitted two cigarettes, a taco, and a handful of Reese's Pieces. 

**Description:** SCP-3129 is a male humanoid, appearing to be 31 years of age (although the subject's mental state has been estimated as significantly more infantile). SCP-3129 refers to itself as "Kalinin", and was known by this pseudonym in several internet-based communities prior to containment. 

Despite no known connections to or knowledge of the Foundation, SCP-3129 has claimed to be the source of several other SCPs currently in containment. These objects include:

[[[SCP-186]]] - To End All Wars
[[[SCP-518]]] - The Transinformational Tomb of Asa Rutledge
[[[SCP-655]]] - Biological Disinformation Campaign
[[[SCP-736]]] - The Iapetus Anomaly

[[[SCP-1097]]] - Liquefied Empath
[[[SCP-1166]]] - Perfect Lab Specimen
[[[SCP-1229]]] - Thirty-Seven Films Starring Lana Neal
[[[SCP-1377]]] - Automaton Parliament
[[[SCP-1484]]] - Murder Diary
[[[SCP-1709]]] - Human Fetus Composite
[[[SCP-1984]]] - Dead Hand

In addition, SCP-3129 has also claimed authorship of the following field reports:

[[[Faith of the Foundation]]]
[[[Strangers of Site-17 | Strangers of Site-17: 105]]]
[[[Strangers of Site-17 Part Two | Strangers of Site-17: 343]]]
[[[strangers of site 17 part three | Strangers of Site-17: Hayakawa]]]

How SCP-3129 obtained detailed information on these subjects is currently unknown; when questioned, SCP-3129 attributed its knowledge to its habit of repeatedly watching //Eraserhead// instead of sleeping. Research into SCP-3129's anomalous properties and inexplicable knowledge is ongoing. 

**Interview 3129-1:** //The following interview between Dr. Holtzman and SCP-3129 was conducted on 07/09/2012 in Holding Room 3C at Site-17://

> **Dr. Holtzman:** I'm going to ask you now about your knowledge of various SCPs contained elsewhere in Foundation custody. 
> 
> **SCP-3129:** Go for it. 
> 
> **Dr. Holtzman:** Have you been to [[[SCP-186]]]?
> 
> **SCP-3129:** No, but I hear it's lovely in the fall.
> 
> **Dr. Holtzman:** No knowledge of it then?
> 
> **SCP-3129:** Noooope. Except that Jean Durand is definitely //not// human. 
> 
> **Dr. Holtzman:** Huh. Tell me about [[[SCP-518]]]. 
> 
> **SCP-3129:** I used to live near a ghost town that was slowly sinking into a marsh. Thinking that geology and natural processes are the lamest way for a ghost town to vanish ever, I figured that it would be better if some crazy old man who sold his soul to what he thought was the Devil caused it. People like overly complicated explanations for natural processes.
> 
> **Dr. Holtzman:** Moving on. [[[SCP-655]]]?
> 
> **SCP-3129:** That one is what I wish the movie "Congo" was about. 
> 
> **Dr. Holtzman:** According to your file, you have knowledge of [[[SCP-736]]]. 
> 
> **SCP-3129:** I remember reading this thing one time about how Mercury has slight oddities in its orbit, and there's a small chance it'll hit Earth in like a billion years of something. Who wants to wait billions of years for a small chance? So I figured someone needed to speed up the process. And Saturn's got a few extra moons. Doesn't hurt that Iapetus already reads like an SCP. 
> 
> **Dr. Holtzman:** Just so you know, there's a proposal to reduce the SCP-736 Research Team's budget since no one at the Foundation can seem to figure out just what the hell this thing is. 
> 
> **SCP-3129:** That's cold, man. 
> 
> **Dr. Holtzman:** State for the record your association with [[[SCP-1097]]].
> 
> **SCP-3129:** For a while, I got really into the idea of alkaline hydrolysis. I mean, what better use is there for a human body than to turn it into a pile of goo? Anyway, I ended up writing a children's TV show pilot that involved ten fuzzy, cute woodland creatures that had been euthanized and then liquefied all at once at a county animal shelter. Because if anything's cuter than ten fuzzy animals, it's a viscous substance combining the biological material of those animals. The networks didn't pick it up, so I had to do something with the general concept. 
> 
> **Dr. Holtzman:** How did you first become aware of [[[SCP-1166]]]?
> 
> **SCP-3129:** You ever see that movie //Ratatouille//?
> 
> **Dr. Holtzman:** Yes, it was sufficiently entertaining, though the best Pixar movie is still [DATA EXPUNGED]. 
> 
> **SCP-3129:** Well, I thought to myself, "what if instead of an intelligent rat with culinary aspirations in Paris, you had an intelligent, immortal rat in a lab that gets experimented upon repeatedly?" Comedy goldmine. I've already contacted some people about licensing for plushies and t-shirts.
> 
> **Dr. Holtzman:** Fascinating. We have some reports that you're the person who was uploading [[[SCP-1229]]]. 
> 
> **SCP-3129:** Is SCP-1229 the thing with the clowns and the amputee hookers?
> 
> **Dr. Holtzman:** No. It's the series of anomalous videos featuring an actress who died in the 1970s. 
> 
> **SCP-3129:** Oh yeah. As an avid creepypasta fan, I love anomalous broadcasts. So do a lot of other people, so it seemed like a perfect opportunity to shamelessly mine upvotes. 
>  
> **Dr. Holtzman:** "Upvotes"?
> 
> **SCP-3129:** ...nevermind. 
> 
> **Dr. Holtzman:** And [[[SCP-1377]]]?
> 
> **SCP-3129:** Do you consider youself, a...believer, in democracy, Doctor?
> 
> **Dr. Holtzman:** I'm not discussing politics with you again. We had to requisition an entire replacement crate of horse tranquilizers after that episode.
> 
> **SCP-3129:** No, no, it's not like that. No, see, I know of a place, a beautiful utopia, where our fates are determined daily by rubbery mockeries of humanity. Their soulless, dead eyes, twinkling with our pyres as we dance in the flames. They send me voter guides every year. Would you like one?
> 
> **Dr. Holtzman:** No thanks. What about [[[SCP-1484]]]?
> 
> **SCP-3129:** I really liked those "Choose Your Own Adventure" books as a kid. But the disappointing thing about them was that nothing bad ever happened to you in real life if you got a bad ending. While I thought it would be kind of cheesy to have the book literally kill you, I tried to make something even better: A book that lets you re-experience a horrible, violent death, any time you want! Doesn't that sound awesome?
> 
> **Dr. Holtzman:** SCP-1484 has put several researchers in the medical bay due to D-Class reacting violently to its anomalous effects.
> 
> **SCP-3129:** Yeah, people didn't react to that one quite the way I'd hoped. 
> 
> **Dr. Holtzman:** Tell me about [[[SCP-1709]]]. 
> 
> **SCP-3129:** This old lady I see at the supermarket will say "hi" to me sometimes. So I wondered, "what if she barfed up fetuses that said 'hi' to me instead? That would be kind of funny." The rest is history. 
> 
> **Dr. Holtzman:** Mmmhmm. And you claim to be the creator of [[[SCP-1984]]]?
> 
> **SCP-3129:** Dude. Give me some credit. I mean, I'm not delusional, I know that I'm not some dead Russian scientist or something. I'm just the guy who revealed its existence to the world. By the way, you may want to steer clear of the entirety of the Earth during the next Russian election.
> 
> **Dr. Holtzman:** That will be all, SCP-3129. 
> 
> **SCP-3129:** Cool. Can I have my internet connection back?
> 
> **Dr. Holtzman:** No. 
> 
> END TRANSCRIPT
