**Link:** [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2235 SCP-2235]

**Summary:** //"SCP-2235 collectively refers to 5███ human bones located in the MV Goya shipwreck belonging to passengers aboard the ship on 04/16/1945. Each instance is sentient, and capable of vocalizing in a tone and pitch identical to their deceased counterpart. Upon any individual coming within 5 meters of any SCP-2235 instance, said entity will generate a variety of humanoid noises, including but not limited to groaning, gasping, and/or sobbing1. On occasion, instances will speak, most commonly in German. Despite attempts using MTF Omicron Rho ("The Dream Team"), further conversion with SCP-2235 instances is yet to be achieved."//

**Commentary:** My very first SCP. Based on the writing, pacing, etc, it's honestly easy to tell. 

So, I happened to get into the Foundation around the exact time I was interested in the Titanic sinking and similar events, such as the MV Wilhelm Gustloff, the Lusitania, the Britannic, and of course, the MV Goya. I noticed it was one of the most interesting sinkings (depending on what you consider interesting); It sank in a little more than 4 minutes, broke in half almost instantly after it was hit by two torpedoes, and killed twice as many people as the Titanic did. I also noticed that it barely got any attention, with it being the second worst maritime disaster in history //ever//. So, I made a scip centered around it. While I was brainstorming it, I kinda got interested in the idea of making the Foundation itself contribute to its sinking. So I implemented that as well. Oh, and some format screwing.

**Link:** [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3490 SCP-3490]

**Summary:** //"SCP-3490 is a self-sustaining cumulus cloud present over the Pacific Ocean, south of the Kiribati Islands. SCP-3490 behaves similarly to that of a non-anomalous cloud, often precipitating and changing shape, though it has never dissipated or left its initial location."//

**Commentary:** My second ever SCP. Unique and original nickname amiright?

Around this time, I was still interested in explaining historical events through the Foundation. The base of this article was always to give Amelia Earhart a happy ending, specifically by being transported to some happy world of sunshine and rainbows and cheese and living the rest of her life there and dying happy and stuff. My first idea was having her fly through an anomalous area of space over the Pacific Ocean that transported you to a world of cookies and milk. And then the idea was what it is now. In all honesty I'm pretty pleased with it. Short and sweet. I think the only reason there's a few downvotes is because there's certain people (who I have talked to about why they downvoted) who just don't like scips that explain historical events. In retrospect, I guess that could be the reason 2235 isn't doing so hot either.

**Link:** [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3845 SCP-3845]

**Summary:** //"SCP-3845 is a humanoid entity, roughly two meters tall. SCP-3845's head/torso takes the shape of a symmetrical ovoid, with legs and arms extending off of it, long and tubular in shape. Hands take a shape similar to the head, and feet are simply 90° bends in the legs. Facial features are present on the front of SCP-3845's head, though the eyebrows are the only features capable of moving or contorting."//

**Commentary:** My third SCP. It includes my persona so please go downvote it :P.

In all seriousness though, this was a mini-hell in the drafting stages. I believe I revised it approximately 64,973,490,894 times, changing the narrative direction in almost every revision as well. At first it was just the first addendum, the first transcript, and then nothing else (except the first transcript had a completely different "Sallie" character, as well as a different story). Next there was the first transcript, then the second transcript, and then a third addendum talking about how it escaped the island, along with some interviews and an "Archived Containment Procedures". And then I //scrapped all that//, and made the third addendum focused on it being neutralized, with a MTF log. Then //I scrapped all that again//, and started from Addendum 1. I rewrote Transcript 1 and 2 to what it currently is now, as well as Addendum 3.

With this page, I hoped to do something that isn't much done around here. Instead of having a really intriguing and complex concept with simple execution, I did a fairly simple concept with a (hopefully) intriguing and solid execution. I hope I accomplished my goal, or something similar. I'm pretty satisfied with it, at least.

Also, about that secondary image that was removed. I'll just show it here, because why not. It was meant to be an example of an Artifact 1 instance, but got destroyed by all the "I can tell it's CGI".

Just kidding, you mortal fool. I have no tales. It would be pretty nifty to have a tail though.
