**Link:** [[[SCP-3490]]]

**Summary:** //"SCP-3490 is a self-sustaining cumulus cloud present over the Pacific Ocean, south of the Kiribati Islands. SCP-3490 behaves similarly to that of a non-anomalous cloud, often precipitating and changing shape, though it has never dissipated or left its initial location."//

**Commentary:** My second ever SCP. Unique and original nickname amiright?

Around this time, I was still interested in explaining historical events through the Foundation. The base of this article was always to give Amelia Earhart a happy ending, specifically by being transported to some happy world of sunshine and rainbows and cheese and living the rest of her life there and dying happy and stuff. My first idea was having her fly through an anomalous area of space over the Pacific Ocean that transported you to a world of cookies and milk. And then the idea was what it is now. In all honesty I'm pretty pleased with it. Short and sweet. I think the only reason there's a few downvotes is because there's certain people (who I have talked to about why they downvoted) who just don't like scips that explain historical events. In retrospect, I guess that could be the reason 2235 isn't doing so hot either.

**Link:** [[[SCP-3845]]]

**Summary:** //"SCP-3845 is a humanoid entity, roughly two meters tall. SCP-3845's head/torso takes the shape of a symmetrical ovoid, with legs and arms extending off of it, long and tubular in shape. Hands take a shape similar to the head, and feet are simply 90° bends in the legs. Facial features are present on the front of SCP-3845's head, though the eyebrows are the only features capable of moving or contorting."//

**Commentary:** My third SCP. It includes my persona so please go downvote it :P.

In all seriousness though, this was a mini-hell in the drafting stages. I believe I revised it approximately 64,973,490,894 times, changing the narrative direction in almost every revision as well. At first it was just the first addendum, the first transcript, and then nothing else (except the first transcript had a completely different "Sallie" character, as well as a different story). Next there was the first transcript, then the second transcript, and then a third addendum talking about how it escaped the island, along with some interviews and an "Archived Containment Procedures". And then I //scrapped all that//, and made the third addendum focused on it being neutralized, with a MTF log. Then //I scrapped all that again//, and started from Addendum 1. I rewrote Transcript 1 and 2 to what it currently is now, as well as Addendum 3.

With this page, I hoped to do something that isn't much done around here. Instead of having a really intriguing and complex concept with simple execution, I did a fairly simple concept with a (hopefully) intriguing and solid execution. I hope I accomplished my goal, or something similar. I'm pretty satisfied with it, at least.

Also, about that secondary image that was removed. I'll just show it here, because why not. It was meant to be an example of an Artifact 1 instance, but got destroyed by all the "I can tell it's CGI".

**Link:** [[[SCP-1094-EX]]]

**Summary:** //"SCP-1094-EX refers to a planet in the E-56834 system located 484 light-years from Earth. SCP-1094-EX's size is comparable to that of Jupiter, with a radius of 64,822 km and a mass of 556.6 M,,⊕,,."//

**Commentary:** It me fourth scipo. Fun fact: I ate a banana soon after publishing this one, expecting it to hang around 10+. It ended up being my first //really// successful scip. First one of mine to reach the 40's, I mean.

This went from concept to publishing in 2-3 days I believe. I had the vague idea tucked away in the back of my mind for a long time before then. However, when the [[[Doomsday Contest]]] came around and I wasn't quick enough to join any major groups, I got a sudden inspiration to just start working on something. Maybe it was anger. Either way, I never thought an article with such a quickly-made concept would be liked as much as it was by the community. I kept bragging in the chatroom in the following days. I wore a smile for a while every time I got a new upvote. It was new to me, and very exciting. It's something I'll definitely remember.

In the process, I also fulfilled something I only thought I'd ever dream of doing: I made an -EX! The fact there are so few of them still astonishes me (and makes me feel speshul :v). I also wanted to do a short-but-sweet article at some point. And something involving space. How convenient!

Just kidding, you mortal fool. I have no tales. It would be pretty nifty to have a tail though.
