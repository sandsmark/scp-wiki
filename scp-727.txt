**Item #:** SCP-727

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** A security fence has been constructed around the area of SCP-727 and civilians are to be turned away, officials are to be told that the area around SCP-727 has unstable volcanic activity. Access to SCP-727 is only allowed for testing and requires at least one armed guard. All crafted objects that are produced inside SCP-727 are to be stored in containment room 727-H at Site-██.

**Description:** SCP-727 resembles a smithy of ancient Greek design that has tools from all eras and countries across the world, as well as several tools that have not been identified. The walls and ceiling of SCP-727 are covered with masses of chains that have indeterminable lengths and made from a material similar to iron.

Once a human being enters SCP-727 the chains along the walls and ceiling become active and forcefully ensnare the subject, breaking many of the subject's bones but ensuring that they stay alive (it is to be noted that subjects with re-inforced limbs are not immune to disfigurement). If more than one person enters SCP-727 at a time the chains will procede to kill the subjects via strangling until only one is left alive, testing with non-human animals and inanimate objects have shown that they are thrown out of SCP-727 by the chains. Once the chains have full control of the subject, they will manipulate them in a way similar to a puppet and force them into crafting objects of diverse nature and exceptional quality. The subjects have reported this process as extremely painful, and it is unknown where the material for the crafted objects is procured. After a period of time the chains will throw the subject and their crafted objects out of SCP-727 and become dormant once again until another person enters SCP-727. Subjects that have been forced to work within SCP-727 are given no sustenance and no opportunity to sleep; if a subject becomes unconscious they will be thrown out of SCP-727.

Subjects that have survived the process are severely crippled and deformed with many of their bones broken and joints twisted, however all of the subjects have later shown to possess great dexterity when working with their hands. People interacting with surviving subjects express feelings of disgust at their disfigurement even if those people are used to working with disabled people. The only long-term psychological impact that SCP-727 has on subjects is that they become very withdrawn and do not actively seek out human contact.

Every so often, the chains will keep the subject within SCP-727 for days at a time forcing them to work on one large craft. So far all of these large projects have met with failure as no subject has lived long enough to survive the process. For a list of the failed crafted objects see 'Addendum-727'.

SCP-727 was discovered after a large amount of disfigured people were talking about a 'miracle forge' in ██████, Greece. Eventually SCP-727 was tracked down and all the people who had fallen victim to it were administered Class-B amnesiacs and placed in hospitals throughout Greece.

**Addendum-727:** The list of failed crafts from SCP-727 are as follows:
A half-built humanoid construct with jointed limbs and a height of 10 metres.
A massive chariot of unknown metal that was later tested to be able to withstand temperatures of over 6000^^o^^C.
A helmet and pair of sandals that had intricate 'wings' on them made from silver. The subject expired while engraving the 'wings'.
A large piece of unknown metal that was shown to be nearly indestructible. The metal was placed into SCP-727's forge for 65 hours in which the subject expired.
A large door-frame and door were crafted but the subject expired while working on the locking mechanism for them. The locking mechanism was shown to not match any known design.
A clay statue that resembled a young woman. The subject was throttled by the chains for an unknown reason and the clay woman shattered when it was thrown out of SCP-727.
