++ {{LEVEL 5/2759 CLEARANCE ONLY}}[[/div]]
-----
**Item #:** SCP-2759

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to the size of the location, the area containing SCP-2759 is to be patrolled and surrounded by 4.5m high barbed wire fencing while a better form of containment is established. The patch of desert within visual range of SCP-2759 is extremely large but arid and uninhabited. All individuals coming within 5km are to be detained, questioned and amnesticised. SCP-2759-1 is to be kept in a standard containment chamber and secured with Level 4 Clearance.

**Description:** SCP-2759 refers to former Location of Interest and Unexplained Environment 54701. SCP-2759 appears to be an exact replica of the Ziggurat of Ur, found to have materialized near White Sands, New Mexico. Given the significance of the original Ziggurat, //Etemenniguru//[[footnote]]A name which translates roughly to "Temple whose foundation emanates aura".[[/footnote]], the complex has been contained and is under heavy scrutiny and analysis by Foundation historians and archaeologists. 

Although mostly non-anomalous, there have been multiple reports of various "moving shadows" cast on the walls and floor of the temple upon observation. It is unknown if this phenomenon is hallucinogenic or otherwise. Thus, SCP-2759 was re-classified as Euclid as of ██/██/████.

SCP-2759-1 refers to a clay brick altar recovered from within the central shrine of SCP-2759. The object was discovered with the skeletal remains of an unknown individual laying on its surface. Dating places the remains at approximately ████ years old. 

Unlike other altars of its kind, SCP-2759-1 features atypical iconography, including several large cuneiform symbols engraved into the sides of the object.[[footnote]]Translated roughly as "TRANSPORT/MOVEMENT, GARDEN, HALL/VESTIBULE, UNDERNEATH"[[/footnote]]

SCP-2759-1's primary anomalous nature becomes apparent when an individual dies while laying across the surface of the object. The subject does not need to be awake for this --and therefore sedation is to be administered during testing--.[[footnote]] As of ██/██/████, inert gases will now be used for ease of testing and subject comfort.[[/footnote]] SCP-2759-1 seems to operate without issue regardless of its distance from SCP-2759. Once death has occurred, the altar will vibrate for around thirty seconds, after which the cuneiform symbol for "TRANSPORT/MOVEMENT" will flash briefly and emit a soft tone. The altar will then cease action.

[DATA EXPUNGED]

**Incident Log 2759-#3:**

During evaluative testing of SCP-2759-1, Sr. Researcher Rowena Scully reportedly left her work-provided cell phone on SCP-2759-1's surface while administering inert gas (Nitrogen) to D-8821. Twenty minutes later, Dr. Rosenberg received a call from Scully's number, despite her phone having been accounted for. Dr. Rosenberg was then able to speak to the deceased D-8821 via an unknown means. The transcript of the call can be found below:

> [BEGIN TRANSCRIPT]
> 
> **Dr. Rosenberg:** Hello, yes?
> 
> **D-8821:** Doc? Are you there? 
> 
> **Dr. Rosenberg:** Rowena? Who is this?
> 
> **D-8821:** What do you mean? Is this part of the test? I know you guys mess with weird shit, but this one hell of a trip.
> 
> **Dr. Rosenberg:** Wait... D-8821?
> 
> **D-8821:** Yeah. Last thing I remember was you guys knocking me out? Now I'm... here.
> 
> //A brief period of silence is heard as Dr. Rosenberg sets up a recording device and places the call on speakerphone.//
> 
> **Dr. Rosenberg:** Understood. Can you describe your surroundings?
> 
> **D-8821:** Well, uh, it looks a lot like that temple you showed me. The one from New Mexico? I woke up, half naked on some stone bricks out here. I found the phone shortly afterward. Yours is the only name I recognize from the contacts. 
> 
> //At this time, SCP-2759 was searched and monitored for signs of D-8821; none were found.//
> 
> **D-8821:** I'm definitely not in New Mexico. Too cold. Foggy. I think I see trees. 
> 
> **Dr. Rosenberg:** We're not picking you up at either complex. Do you see any identifying landmarks?
> 
> **D-8821:** Too much fog. Cant see maybe ten feet in any direction outside the temple. Maybe I'll see something from the top. Give me a second.
> 
> //Silence, followed by sounds of movement for approximately ten seconds.//
> 
> **D-8821:** Oh boy.
> 
> **Dr. Rosenberg:** What do you see?
> 
> **D-8821:** Well, uh, it just seems to go on forever. The fog. There is only this place. Where the hell am I, Doc?
> 
> **Dr. Rosenberg:** I don't know. We are trying to locate you.
> 
> **D-8821:** Fuck. The battery is dying. What should I do?
> 
> **Dr. Rosenberg:** Stay where you are for now. We will try to send someone to aid you.
> 
> **D-8821:** Please do. Tell them to bring me a sweatshirt.
> 
> **Dr. Rosenberg:** Good luck, D-8821.
> 
> **D-8821:** Yeah.
> 
> [END TRANSCRIPT]
> 
> //Note: Following this call all contact with D-8821 was lost.//

**Addendum 2759-#1:**

Due to the events of Incident 2759-#3, it has been determined that SCP-2759-1 is not sacrificial by nature, but is some sort of ancillary tool used for interstellar or trans-dimensional travel. 

Subjects report a brief period of unconsciousness following death that lasts approximately fifteen minutes. After this period, the subject's consciousness will be translocated to another copy of SCP-2759 seemingly not located on Earth, designated SCP-2759-E1. Subjects retain a portion of the items and clothing they died with, however, man-made materials have been shown to degrade at a variable accelerated rate. Through extensive testing, the following factors have been found to influence what will ultimately be transferred to SCP-2759-E1:

* Size and shape of the item (With a preference for smaller and rounder objects)
* Complexity of the item[[footnote]] Audio broadcasting equipment averages at a 27% rate of success, cameras/video equipment 18%, with more sensitive equipment yielding an average 10% chance of transference. [[/footnote]]
* How the item relates to the concept of "tool", "instrument" or "weapon"[[footnote]] Average rate of transference for a basic weapon (Tactical knife): 3.4% [[/footnote]]
* How the item relates to the concept of "clothing" vs "belongings"
* Attachment to item (Sentimental or otherwise)

GPS positioning systems fail to trace the location of SCP-2759-E1, however, audiovisual transmissions can still be received with decent clarity when receivers are placed within .4km of SCP-2759, SCP-2759-1, or the original temple complex.[[footnote]] Classification of which as a Location of Interest pending site director approval. [[/footnote]]

SCP-2759-E1's environment and atmosphere are unknown. It is presumably breathable and generally considered cold, humid and subject to a dense fog that surrounds the complex proper. Unlike SCP-2759, SCP-2759-E1 is the only temple complex with architectural deviations from the original Ziggurat of Ur, including a spacial anomaly at the center that is defined as SCP-2759-E2.

It is believed that the dimension containing SCP-2759-E1 and SCP-2759-E2 has a mild cognitohazardous effect on sentient beings, the full scope of which is unknown at this time.

**Exploration Log 2759-Enlil:**

[[include component:image-block name=bloodmoon.jpg|caption=Moon of SCP-2759-E2, enlarged.]]

**Abstract:** Exploration 2759-Enlil was approved and took place on ██/██/████, two days after contact with D-8821 was lost. D-3733 was sent through SCP-2759-1 with audiovisual recording equipment, one hooded sweatshirt, and a small kit containing a flashlight, three flares, extra batteries and two granola bars, establishing contact 18 minutes after death.

> 
> [BEGIN LOG]
> 
> **D-3733:** Did one of you take my pants? What the hell, guys. It's really cold and-
> 
> **Control:** Okay, D-3733. Let's get started. You'll find at least one camera should have stayed with your person. Please take it out and activate it. 
> 
> **D-3733:** Ugh, alright. Let me just tie the sweatshirt around my waist.
> 
> //After approximately one minute, camera feed comes live, revealing a full frame of gray fog. D-3733 is seen scaling the side of the temple complex. As they approach the zenith, subject pans camera around, revealing the expanses of fog to stretch on around SCP-2759-E1 in all directions. The fog line terminates abruptly just outside the perimeter. Sky is a dark, purple color. No celestial bodies are present, but area is dimly lit and desaturated in color.//
> 
> **D-3733:** I'll be damned. No stars. Where is this?
> 
> **Control:** That's what we're hoping to find out.
> 
> **D-3733:** I'm going to die out here, aren't I?
> 
> **Control:** What makes you say that?
> 
> **D-3733:** Just a feeling. There's a heaviness to this place. It feels like death. And sorrow. I don't know.
> 
> **Control:** Just try and remain calm, look for signs of D-8821.
> 
> **D-3733:** I'm calm, I'm calm.
> 
> //Subject stops for a moment and breathes. After a period of silence a young child's voice is heard.//
> 
> **D-3733:** Huh? Wait, hey! Hey!
> 
> //Camera swings around to pick up brief movement coming from the entrance to the interior of the central temple.//
> 
> **D-3733:** Someone just went inside. Should I follow?
> 
> **Control:** Affirmative. You'll find a flashlight and some flares in your kit.
> 
> //Brief silence, some wind and rustling is heard.//
> 
> **D-3733:** Found the flares. No flashlight.
> 
> **Control:** At least it's something.
> 
> //D-3733 is seen approaching the threshold at the top of SCP-2759-1. Subject lights a torch, which bathes the corridor in red light.//
> 
> **D-3733:** Hello? Anyone?
> 
> //D-3733 proceeds down the hall, into the central shrine, or cella, which contains several connecting pathways. The walls are lined with cuneiform symbols and imagery, and a group of clayware pots litter the ground in pieces of varying size. Post analysis revealed much of the symbols relate to Ereshkigal, Sumerian goddess of the Underworld.// 
> 
> **D-3733:** I hear something.
> 
> //Audio feed picks up the sounds of whispers coming from the hallways. As D-3733 passes by, figures are seen moving in the shadows.//
> 
> **D-3733:** There are people... They're hiding just outside of view. I don't know how many.
> 
> **Control:** Just be careful. 
> 
> //Subject takes a moment before choosing a direction. The red light reveals the hall to be empty and slopes downward. The ceiling drops swiftly and turns sharply right. After a few seconds, a distant scream is heard.//
> 
> **D-3733:** This place is freaking me out. The walls are cold. 
> 
> **Control:** Noted. Please continue.
> 
> //D-3733 descends into the heart of the temple. The camera picks up further signs of distress and unintelligible vocalizations.//
> 
> **D-3733:** No, No, fuck this, pull me out. Whatever nonsense voodoo Matrix shit you guys are working, time to get me out of here. 
> 
> **Control:** That is not possible at this time. Your mission is to locate D-8821. 
> 
> [EXTRANEOUS DIALOGUE REMOVED]
> 
> **D-3733:** Fine, but don't expect me to be happy about it.
> 
> **Control:** Understandable. Please, if you would.
> 
> //D-3733 sighs and continues on. Coming to a small intersection, subject lights up the left pathway, revealing it to be a dead end. Three emaciated, naked humanoids are crouched in the corner and sharing a single tattered blanket. They do not look up at D-3733, but are heard whimpering and speaking in an unknown language. One figure appears to be albino in pigmentation.//
> 
> **D-3733:** I'm not going up to them. 
> 
> **Control:** Fine. 
> 
> //Subject chooses the right hand path, which continues to slope downward as it angles back towards the center of the temple. D-3733 says nothing for several minutes, stopping multiple times to look behind him. The flare starts to burn out, D-3733 proceeds to light another. Upon closer inspection, the used flare appears aged and worn, burning out five minutes earlier than expected.//
> 
> **D-3733:** At this rate I'm going to be out of light in no time. //Ina etuti absu.//[[footnote]] Sumerian for "[To] live in darkness". [[/footnote]] Wait, what did I say?
> 
> **Control:** We believe that the environment may be exerting some effect on your cognition. How do you feel?
> 
> //Mild static interference overtakes the audio feed for two seconds.//
> 
> **D-3733:**  -[stu]pid question. I feel like I'm walking into my grave. 
> 
> **Control:** I understand that this is not an optimal situation. The sooner you find D-8821, the sooner we can find a way to get you back.
> 
> //Subject does not respond and moves along the now bare walls. D-3733 proceeds for three minutes before the hallway terminates sharply in a 180° turn that continues down into darkness.//
> 
> **D-3733:** //Ana harrani sa alaktasa la tarat, eli baltuti ima'idu mituti//.[[footnote]]Sumerian. Roughly "On this road, whose course has no way back, the dead will outnumber the living." [[/footnote]]
> 
> **Control:** I'm sorry?
> 
> **D-3733:** I didn't say anything.
> 
> //The pathway begins to widen out, another right turn is seen at the bottom of the landing.//
> 
> **D-3733:** There's light up ahead.
> 
> //As D-3733 rounds the corner, an archway is seen roughly 30m away. Waves are heard, crashing against unseen shores. Several voices are discerned, drowned out by the other noise.//
> 
> **D-3733:** I feel a breeze. Is that the sky?
> 
> //Subject approaches the area now designated as SCP-2759-E2, the microphone picking up the sounds of more voices. As D-3733 emerges from the archway, the ruins of an amphitheater-esque complex come into focus. The "seats" of the structure grow larger and steeper as they move outward, becoming impossible to peer over and reaching an unknown height. One wall of the structure seems to have collapsed, and waves from a dark ocean on the other side roll in, pooling in the far side, across from the door back into SCP-2759-E1. Figures are seen in abundance, easily a hundred. All individuals seem to be emaciated and vary widely in physical characteristics. A few possess additional limbs or mutations. All appear to be sapient and intelligent to a degree, conversing with one another in various unknown languages ranging from heavily distorted Sumerian to hisses and clicks. No sign of D-8821 is found.//
> 
> **D-3733:** This just keeps getting weirder. Look.
> 
> //Subject points the camera upwards to reveal a small moon, orange-red in color, lingering in the violet sky.//
> 
> **D-3733:** No moon outside the temple, as far as I could tell.
> 
> //A group of humanoids are seen loitering down by the shore. D-3733 proceeds to the pool to investigate.//
> 
> **D-3733:** These guys don't seem hostile. They all seem quite sad, actually.
> 
> //Approaching the waterline, D-3733 keeps to himself, although several figures are seen looking at him and speaking to one another.//
> 
> **D-3733:** Hi, guys. 
> 
> //Figures say nothing but continue to stare. Minor interference is detected on both audio and visual equipment.//
> 
> **D-3733:** Oh, I know.
> 
> //Subject checks the kit and retrieves the granola bars, one of which has survived the journey. D-3733 unwraps it, breaking it into pieces and offering it to them.//
> 
> **D-3733:** You guys eat? Like food? Food? Sorry about the raisins, what can you do.
> 
> //Creatures step back cautiously as D-3733 approaches. With some convincing, one individual, possessing scales and a flat, widened forehead, tentatively reaches out and accepts a piece. Entity sniffs the item and eats it, expressing approval. Creature says something to the others, one of them is heard saying "akalum", or "food". Several others approach in interest, including two which appear to have chitinous carapaces and large insect-like mandibles. They make noise like cicadas as they snatch bits of granola and consume them voraciously.// 
> 
> **D-3733:** Whoa, slow down, there's not much left-
> 
> //D-3733 is interrupted by a distressed vocalization. Camera turns to show a humanoid writhing on the ground, howling in pain. Several other figures crowd around curiously. A few moments later, the figures hoist the troubled humanoid and drag it, screaming, to the water's edge. They pause for a moment, as if reluctant, and then push the entity into the water. It disappears beneath and does not resurface. No signs of struggle are seen. At this point, an unknown Sumerian dialect is detected among the chatter. POI-2759-A, an antlered humanoid, is seen speaking to D-3733. A Foundation historian is brought in to help with translation.//
> 
> **POI-2759-A:** [Are] you the //Annunaki//? The ones who know the stars? They who birthed the [unknown]? 
> 
> **D-3733:** [in Sumerian] They are the child of //Ningishzidda//, Lord of the Artifact of Life. They see through the eyes and ears of all children.
> 
> **POI-2759-A:** We are those without light, those which wait for the gates of //Anu//. Eternal [unknown] of the gateway, the [firmament/world] of twilight.
> 
> **Control:** Please ask the individual where you are located.
> 
> **D-3733:** I don't think they understand English.
> 
> **POI-2759-A:** Have you come to pay rites to the Mistress of the Underworld?
> 
> **D-3733:** [in Sumerian] They are the souls of the damned, open the gate so they may enter the Valley.
> 
> //POI-2759-A frowns and appears to step aside, allowing D-3733 a full view of the ocean, which stretches as far as the eye can see. No fog is present. The water slowly ripples.//
> 
> **D-3733:** I don't like the look of this.
> 
> //Control decides not to tell the subject about their conversation with POI-2759-A. D-3733 stares into the pond.//
> 
> **D-3733:** I feel nauseous. I need a minute.
> 
> //Subject sets the camera down and sits on the pathway. Thirty seconds of silence pass, D-3733 is seen sitting with his head in his hands. Subject looks out at the water, which is still black in color.//
> 
> **D-3733:** There's something in the water.
> 
> //D-3733 picks up the camera and angles it downward. Small specks are seen in the distance. The water is abnormally clear, the waves almost velvet in nature. Due to worsening static distortion, it is impossible to discern what the objects are.//
> 
> **D-3733:** The //Tiamatu.//[[footnote]]"abyss/ocean"[[/footnote]] [pause] That's what it is called, I think. The hole of the unclean. What? Get out of my head.

> **Control:** Are you alright?
> 
> **D-3733:** I'm sorry, yes, it's this place. It's trying to talk to me, to talk through me. Filling my head with knowledge and... oh.

> 
> **D-3733:** I-I see.

**Incident Log 2759-#4:**

On ██/██/████, personnel on site at SCP-2759 reported the activation of SCP-2759-1 without external manipulation. No one was observed leaving or arriving from SCP-2759-1, --it is unknown at this time who or what may have caused the artifact to activate.-- (See **Addendum-2759-#2**) 

**Exploration Log 2759-Eribu:**

**Abstract:** Exploration 2759-Eribu was approved after the events of Incident Log 2759-#4. The goal of the exploration was to ascertain the possible cause for SCP-2759-1's activation. D-1212 was administered inert gas (Nitrogen) while laying across the surface of SCP-2759-1, equipped with the same gear as in the previous log, an extra flashlight and additional provisions. Audio contact was established 21 minutes after death.

> //Once more, the camera's activation reveals SCP-2759-E1 and its fog-lined perimeter. D-1212 is instructed to observe the rest of the temple exterior before entering the cella. Subject's breath is seen as they circumnavigate the center of the temple.//

> **D-1212:** You'll get me out of here if things go south?
> 
> **Control:** We'll do everything we can to keep you safe.
> 
> **D-1212:** Thank you.
> 
> //Coming around the side, another entrance into the temple is visible, farther down and out of view. In the video feed, a dark silhouette is seen peering out of the entrance. Subject starts towards it, wordlessly, and the entity disappears into the structure. D-1212 approaches the entryway and points the camera into the darkness. She pauses, then pulls off her pack and looks inside, taking out a flashlight and switching it on.//
> 
> //The hallway is wide but low, dipping down before ending at a left turn. More cuneiform imagery is seen on the walls, the symbols "mul" and "ki"[[footnote]] "Mulki" meaning "A celestial body which has been separated/cleaved/broken."[[/footnote]] are represented, seen carved over the relief sculptures that were present before. The reason for this vandalism is unknown.//

**Addendum 2759-#2:**

Since the events of Exploration 2759-Eribu and with the assistance of O5-11, Site Command of SCP-2759 has been alerted of the existence of a heretofore unknown Mobile Task Force consisting exclusively of incorporeal entities/informational construct replications of Foundation agents.[[footnote]] MacLaughlin was later identified as Agent ███████ MacLaughlin, determined KIA on ██/██/████ following a containment breach of SCP-███. [[/footnote]] These beings are able to freely travel using SCP-2759-1's anomalous properties utilizing an unknown vector.[[footnote]] Recovered materials suggest SCP-2759-E1 is likely entirely construct in nature, however, the "realness" of its reality is still subject of debate. [[/footnote]] Using SCP-2759-E1 as a focal point, Foundation administration are now able to communicate with the deceased [[[task-forces#omega-0 |Mobile Task Force Omega-Zero]]] ("Ará Orún") and corroborate, plan and execute missions effectively.

**Exploration Log 2759-Anzu:**

**Abstract:** On 09/13/2012, an exploration of SCP-2759-E1 and SCP-2759-1's alternate destinations was approved by O5-11. A team of five members from MTF ω-0 were selected to travel to SCP-2759-E1, set up a small short-term camp, then split up into teams to explore both remaining destinations and, if possible, find another instance of SCP-2759-1 to return with. Kits packed with standard Mobile Task Force gear and audiovisual surveillance equipment were placed on SCP-2759-1 during transport.

After one hour of radio silence, it was assumed that none of the broadcast equipment successfully transferred to SCP-2759-E1. Two weeks after the start of the exploration, a personal log book of the late agent Richard Larenz was discovered on the grounds of SCP-2759.
