**Item #:** SCP-2341-J

**Object Class:** Safe (Keter reclassification pending)

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2341-J is currently housed at Site-48. The object is to be kept in a Level 1 containment locker. Access is granted to all personnel of Site-48.

**Description:** SCP-2341-J is an indestructible standard digital alarm clock developed by the █████ company. Though it possesses standard buttons for an alarm clock otherwise, there is no visible control to switch off the alarm. SCP-2341-J functions like a normal alarm clock, even without batteries.

The only anomalous property that is known occurs when a subject is 10 meters from the object while in REM sleep. Usually, subjects that are having a dream[[footnote]]All dreams are reported to be enjoyable to the subject. I.e. Achievement, a pleasing memory, etc.[[/footnote]]  will be disrupted by SCP-2341-J at 6:10 AM by a digital chime that plays a version of "Frère Jacques" with several notes arbitrarily off-key. The volume is unpredictable but has been as high as 90 dB.

In 100% of all cases, subjects will be enraged by SCP-2341-J and will attempt to destroy the object because of SCP-2341-J's chime.

The only known method to turn off the alarm of SCP-2341-J after it has been activated is to engage in Procedure 421-Tantalus.

> **__PROCEDURE 421-Tantalus__**
> 
> 1. Subject will hit the snooze button no more and no less than 15 times.
> 2. Subject will deposit three drops of blood onto the clock face.
> 3. Subject will recite the phrase, with correct diction, "Schnütfleiger Dachlach F'trejnargoöstatchch Üuåh!"[[footnote]] Phrase is Old High Adytum Sarkic and literally translates to "I will defecate on time itself until it becomes my wife." [[/footnote]]

If Procedure 421-Tantalus fails, the alarm will gradually decrease in volume over 3 hours until it becomes silent. Subjects who have failed Procedure 421-Tantalus report having the alarm's iteration of "Frère Jacques" stuck in their head for the following week.

+++++ Interview Log 2341-4-J

**Interviewed:** D-1169

**Interviewer:** Dr. Smith

**Foreword:** Dr. Smith plans to debrief D-1169 after testing with SCP-2341-J

**<Begin Log>**

**Dr. Smith:** So, D-1169, could you describe the events before the alarm clock woke you up?

**D-1169:** Well, I had this awesome dream. I was at this beach, surrounded with these hot babes, ya know? Man, it was awesome. I was using the corpses of a bunch of dictators as a couch and they were all praising how I managed to kill them with only a toothpick and all-American ingenuity. 

**Dr. Smith:** So what happened after that?

**D-1169:** Then the damn alarm clock started makin’ noise. I tried turning the damn thing off but it just getting buzzin’. Now that stupid song's stuck in my head! Fuckin' earworm!

**Dr. Smith:** How does the song go?

(D-1169 hesitates, appearing to go into trance)

**D-1169:** //Elder worm lord, elder worm lord / of my ears, of my ears / cleanse the world of mortals, cleanse the world of mortals / kill them all, kill them all...//

(D-1169 dies of a sudden rectal hemorrhage.)

**Addendum:** An autopsy of D-1169 revealed that upon death, his body had anomalously been filled with carnivorous worms wearing what appeared to be French berets. Keter re-classification pending.
