**Item #:** SCP-964 
 
**Object Class:** Euclid 

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-964 is currently stored in standard containment chamber at Site-45. Access to object are prohibited for all personnel of Site-45 regardless of security level. In the event of containment breach site security must evacuate all compromised sectors, contact Site-11 and await arrival of MTF teams tasked with object's recontainment. Site-45 staff that came in contact with SCP-964 must be processed with accordance to protocol 964Δ6h. If number of affected personnel exceeds 20%, or protocol 964Δ6h cannot be enacted, SCP-964 must be relocated to other Site immediately.

Research on SCP-964 must be conducted remotely, using suitable Foundation facilities located at least 200 km from the Site currently housing the object. All iterations with SCP-964 related materials must be done with accordance to protocol 964Δ6d. All documentation on SCP-964 must be transferred into digital format weekly, and hard copies subsequently incinerated. All digital data must be processed according to protocol 964Δ6r once every two week.

**Description:** SCP-964 is a prototype of next generation active camouflage system, developed by ███████████████ under a contract with U.S. DoD. Object was recovered in 2004 from ███████████████ facility near ███████, Nebraska.

SCP-964 displays the ability to reconstruct itself on atomic level. This reconstruction process can take up to 16 hours and causes complete change of object's appearance, physical properties and chemical composition. The result is usually solid commonly encountered object weighting from 2 to 100 kg and not displaying dangerous or anomalous properties. In rare cases high-energy, radioactive or explosive objects, unenclosed fluids, living entities and objects with mass up to 65 tons were observed. Although the new reconstruction can be theoretically postponed indefinitely, SCP-964 did not remain stable for more than two weeks since its containment by Foundation.

SCP-964 will initiate reconstruction process whenever it detects data related to its current manifestation. This affects all known data formats and storage mediums, including text, photographic materials, encrypted digital data and human long-term memory. Reaction can be delayed through increase in medium complexity and distance from SCP-964. While no method of completely stopping this phenomenon have been found so far, protocols 964Δ6a-r proved mostly successful in minimizing its effect on digital data and personnel.

**Incident Report 964-11:** On 22/09/2006 message "SCP-964 exists" was used to trigger reconstruction process as part of scheduled testing in object's self-preservation mechanisms. After the start of reconstruction object was observed to rapidly lose mass, until it completely disintegrated. SCP-964 was subsequently reclassified as neutralized. Two month after the incident series of accidents suggesting SCP-964 involvement was reported in ████, Sweden. Object successfully recontained.

**Incident Report 964-23:** On 15/01/2008 after typical reconstruction process SCP-964, at the time contained at Site-30, turned into approximately 50 liters of unidentified acidic solution. SCP-964 melted the floor of its containment chamber and proceeded to leak through maintenance shafts, until it initiated new reconstruction process in corridor four levels below. Site-30 security was dispatched at the place of incident. After their arrival close proximity of several video recorders caused SCP-964 to undergo series of transformations in rapid succession, culminating with 20 meters in diameter sphere of high-temperature plasma. SCP-964 was subsequently found in the debris, manifested as 2 meters tall stuffed toy bear, and relocated to another Site.

**Addendum 964a:** In light of incident 964-23 personnel of Site housing SCP-964 a no longer allowed access to documentation related to object or object itself. Information included in transfer documents must be replaced with document 964-R. Document 964-R must classify SCP-964 as Keter level object and contain fabricated description of the object composed from the properties most likely to cause a containment breach in event they are displayed by SCP-964.
