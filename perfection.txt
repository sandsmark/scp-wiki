“Do I hear five hundred thousand pounds?”
“…”
“Thank you…do I hear five fifty?”
“…”
“Thank you ma’am…do I hear six hundred?”
“…”
“Thank you…six fifty?”
“One million pounds.”
“…t…thank you sir.  Do I hear more?”
“…”
“Sold, to Mr. McCredie.  Thank you so much sir.  This next lot…”

The bald man who had just spent a absurd amount of money on a small, somewhat tacky yin-yang medallion rose from his seat and exited the small, lavishly decorated auction room, entering a separate room filled with thick leather chairs, a small but well stocked bar, several men and women in very expensive dress, and a sizeable Christmas tree.  The smell of smoke was very noticeable, but not unpleasant as the bald man lit a cigarette to add to the general haze.  A short, stocky man in a non-descript black suit walked up, bowing slightly before speaking.  “Sir, I take it that you acquired the…um…”  “Yes, yes…” the bald man said, waving his hand in a dismissive gesture.  “Marten, bring the car up for me, and have a valet just load the medallion into the trunk; I don’t want to wait for that ‘secured shipping’ nonsense for weeks.  We’ll be going to the airstrip this evening; I’d like to be at the Paris club by this evening.”

Marten bowed slightly again “Yes, Mr. McCredie.  If I may, your recent acquisition may attract unwanted attention.  I can have it routed through a service in Bhutan that is excellent in dealing with these matters.”  Mr. McCredie took a long drag on his cigarette, waving his hand again as he started to eye a bottle of aged scotch behind the bar.  “Of course, do whatever is necessary, but I want that necklace in Paris by this weekend.  Also, have Arthur and Grant ready in Paris when I get there.”

Marten followed Mr. McCredie as he strode up to the bar, acquiring a very good and very expensive glass of scotch with a few gestures to the bartender.  Marten bowed and spoke again as Mr. McCredie took his first slow sip.  “Will Mrs. McCredie be joining you on this evening’s flight?”  Mr. McCredie’s face twisted with a sour expression as he put down his drink.  “No, no…she’s still pouting in her new apartment over my having to work on her birthday…but we’ll soon see to that, won’t we!”  He laughed, taking another sip.  “Send for her tomorrow morning.  If she makes a fuss, say…I don’t know, something romantic or some such.  She’s young, and still loves to think of herself as a princess…oh, say that she’ll get to meet royalty, that should shut her up and get her packing.”

Marten moved slightly closer, lowering his voice.  “And the…special considerations you asked for have been attended to as well.  A local funeral home has offered its services and crematorium for modest compensation as soon as we are in need.”
McCredie scowled at Marten, waving him away as he turned back to his scotch.  “Really, is it necessary to inform me of every little step?  Go; make things ready, I’ll be leaving here in the hour.  Really, I don’t know why I still bother with these Christmas get-togethers, they always end on some sour note…are you still here?  I said go!”  Marten bowed and quickly walked off, leaving McCredie to his scotch and a drab conversation with member of English parliament.
