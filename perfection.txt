“Do I hear five hundred thousand pounds?”
“…”
“Thank you…do I hear five fifty?”
“…”
“Thank you ma’am…do I hear six hundred?”
“…”
“Thank you…six fifty?”
“One million pounds.”
“…t…thank you sir.  Do I hear more?”
“…”
“Sold, to Mr. McCredie.  Thank you so much sir.  This next lot…”

The bald man who had just spent a absurd amount of money on a small, somewhat tacky yin-yang medallion rose from his seat and exited the small, lavishly decorated auction room, entering a separate room filled with thick leather chairs, a small but well stocked bar, several men and women in very expensive dress, and a sizeable Christmas tree.  The smell of smoke was very noticeable, but not unpleasant as the bald man lit a cigarette to add to the general haze.  A short, stocky man in a non-descript black suit walked up, bowing slightly before speaking.  “Sir, I take it that you acquired the…um…”  “Yes, yes…” the bald man said, waving his hand in a dismissive gesture.  “Marten, bring the car up for me, and have a valet just load the medallion into the trunk; I don’t want to wait for that ‘secured shipping’ nonsense for weeks.  We’ll be going to the airstrip this evening; I’d like to be at the Paris club by this evening.”

Marten bowed slightly again “Yes, Mr. McCredie.  If I may, your recent acquisition may attract unwanted attention.  I can have it routed through a service in Bhutan that is excellent in dealing with these matters.”  Mr. McCredie took a long drag on his cigarette, waving his hand again as he started to eye a bottle of aged scotch behind the bar.  “Of course, do whatever is necessary, but I want that necklace in Paris by this weekend.  Also, have Arthur and Grant ready in Paris when I get there.”

Marten followed Mr. McCredie as he strode up to the bar, acquiring a very good and very expensive glass of scotch with a few gestures to the bartender.  Marten bowed and spoke again as Mr. McCredie took his first slow sip.  “Will Mrs. McCredie be joining you on this evening’s flight?”  Mr. McCredie’s face twisted with a sour expression as he put down his drink.  “No, no…she’s still pouting in her new apartment over my having to work on her birthday…but we’ll soon see to that, won’t we!”  He laughed, taking another sip.  “Send for her tomorrow morning.  If she makes a fuss, say…I don’t know, something romantic or some such.  She’s young, and still loves to think of herself as a princess…oh, say that she’ll get to meet royalty, that should shut her up and get her packing.”

Marten moved slightly closer, lowering his voice.  “And the…special considerations you asked for have been attended to as well.  A local funeral home has offered its services and crematorium for modest compensation as soon as we are in need.”
McCredie scowled at Marten, waving him away as he turned back to his scotch.  “Really, is it necessary to inform me of every little step?  Go; make things ready, I’ll be leaving here in the hour.  Really, I don’t know why I still bother with these Christmas get-togethers, they always end on some sour note…are you still here?  I said go!”  Marten bowed and quickly walked off, leaving McCredie to his scotch and a drab conversation with member of English parliament.

June McCredie came off the jet in bluster of expensive silk, blond hair, and whining.    “This isn’t another one of his stupid little business meetings, is it?  I swear, if he drags me all around town to meet a bunch of old, stupid men in suits, I’m going to scream.  With all the meetings and social stuff he does, you’d think he’d find time to go to one or two real parties!  You know, music and dancing and fancy drinks and all that stuff…not gagging on smoke having to listen to fat old guys talk about pricing strategies and having to act interested.”  She hurried off the tarmac and into the reception area of the McCredie’s private airstrip, as Marten directed the unloading of her considerable baggage from the jet.

Later, as her car ambled its way down the busy Paris streets, she continued her monologue, directing it at the back of Marten’s head as he drove.  “Really, this is it.  I don’t need him, if he’s not going to put some time into our relationship, I don’t know how this is going to work.  We’ve been married a year, and we’ve only gone on three vacations, just the two of us.  Now all he wants to do is stay at that club of his all day and smoke and drink.”  She ended in a huff, crossing her arms and pouting out the window.  Marten smiled, looking in the rear-view mirror.  “Ma’am, I’m sure you appreciate his position.  Your husband is a powerful man, and need to keep up appearances to maintain his position.”  June huffed again, burying herself more into the leather seats and watching Paris roll by.

At a stop, she piped up again, still looking out the window.  “Marten…is…is John in trouble?  I mean…with the government or anything?”  Marten stiffened a little at the wheel, his smile unfazed.  “No ma’am, Mr. McCredie has a quite friendly relationship with parliament, as far as I am aware.”  “Oh,” she sighed, “I was worried…some men came by, asking about him.  They said it was about some delivery to India or something…it sounded like he was in trouble.”  Marten smiled and shook his head, ignoring the sweat starting to form on his palms.  “I’m sure it’s some kind of mix-up, nothing to worry about.”  She nodded, resting her chin on the edge of the door, looking out the window.  “I’m sure…they said something about a foundation or something when they were in the hall…probably just some charity looking for a handout.”  Marten nodded, quietly wiping away a bead of sweat on his forehead as they started forward again.  “Yes, that must be it, very good ma’am...”

After dropping June off at a suitably ostentatious hotel to “freshen up” for the evening, Marten worked his way down a network of side streets to the Pairs chapter clubhouse of Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd, buried in a mass of hotels and boutiques.  After parking in the private underground lot, Marten walked to the elevator, punching in the code for Mr. McCredie’s private room.  Almost as soon as the doors opened, he was roughly grabbed and hurled inside by Arthur and Grant, landing in a heap.  Lifting his head, he took in the room for a moment, decorated in late Victorian style, except for the oddly out of place steel door on the far wall.  Mr. McCredie sat in a huge leather chair, smoking and looking down at Marten with mild amusement.  Arthur wrapped a huge hand into Marten’s collar, lifting him back to his feet as Grant took position next to McCredie’s chair.  McCredie spoke, smoke drifting from his mouth.  “Foundation agents were at my home yesterday.  Care to explain?”

Marten swallowed hard, sweating under McCredie’s lazy but piercing gaze.  “T…they know nothing, sir.  If they knew it was you, they would have already raided the club.  They are not the police or government; they don’t have to justify anything to anyone.  Shooting in the dark is all they can do now.”  His voice carried much more confidence then he felt, and he was sharply aware of the gun-shaped lump in Arthur’s jacket pressing into his spine.  McCredie took a long drag on his cigarette, thinking, before waving his hand, causing Arthur to drop him again.  “Honestly,” McCredie said, “I believe you.  However, we can’t have these things happening again, understand?  I pay you bloody well enough; I expect things to be taken care of in the proper fashion.  Speaking of which, did you manage to get my darling wife to the hotel in one piece?”  Marten nodded, adjusting his suit.  “Yes, she should be by this evening.”  “Excellent,” spoke McCredie, rubbing his hands together. “We should have this all wrapped up by dinner.  Grant, you and Arthur make sure everything is ready for June, will you?”  Both huge men nodded, moving back and opening the heavy steel door, given Marten a view of the bare tiled walls and stained concrete floor drain beyond before the door swung shut again.  McCredie rose, stubbing out his cigarette out and grinning “Well, let’s give her an hour, and then we’ll get this mess over and done with!”

“Ugh…why do these places always smell like smoke and old people?  Why can’t we ever meet at some club or something?  God, I really think he goes out of his way to bug me sometimes…”  June flipped her hair back in disgust, looking around at the sitting room, her black dress shining with small interwoven crystals.  “Why did he want me here even?  Aren’t we supposed to be going out for dinner?”  Marten nodded, smiling.  “Yes ma’am and he will be along shortly.  In the meantime, he wished for me to give you a small gift on his behalf.”  Her eyes immediately lit up, a grin spreading over her face as she squealed happily.  “Really?  Where is it?  Oooh, I love presents…”  Marten gestured to the steel door, and she hurried over, pulling it open with some effort.  “Ugh…what a heavy door…ooh, is that it?  It’s…just a yin-yang with a little chain.  How that is…what is this place?  Arthur?  What are you doing…let…let ME GO!”  The start of her scream was cut off sharply as Marten gently closed the door.
