**Special Containment Procedures:** The building containing SCP-4439 is to be permanently cordoned off from the public. Four agents are to be embedded into the town and serve as the primary caregivers of SCP-4439. An agent is to remain in physical proximity of SCP-4439 at all times, but otherwise is able to carry out his/her regular duties.

In the case of containment breach, additional personnel will be deployed to collect all samples of SCP-4439 and quarantine its spread.

**Description:** SCP-4439 is a stain on a wall located in the second-floor bedroom of a house on the outskirts of ███████, Missouri. The size of the stain is approximately 10 centimeters wide and 30 centimeters in height, located at the top of the easternmost wall of the room. 

SCP-4439 is able to expand or shrink itself on its own accord, reacting to the physical presence of human beings (or lack thereof). In isolation, SCP-4439 begins to spread across all hard surfaces at a rate of 1 meter/hour. In the presence of a human adult, however, SCP-4439 becomes docile, gradually shrinking back to its original size and shape.

Laboratory tests indicate SCP-4439 is comprised of soot and dust, skin cells and traces of human blood.

**Discovery:** Law enforcement officials were called to ███ ██████ Avenue on December 7, 2012, after neighbors reported hearing a woman's screams at 0115 hrs. Upon arrival at the house, however, the owners (a man and woman in their mid-40s) appeared lucid and calm, claiming to have no knowledge of suspicious activity. 

A search of the house uncovered a few drops of blood on one of the bedroom floors. Officers examined the wife for external wounds or signs of duress, but were assured by the husband that it was nothing but a nosebleed, and left the premises shortly after.

A week later, Foundation agents were alerted to increased anomalous activity surrounding the house: a child's cries could be heard repeatedly during the night, even though there was no record of the couple having any offspring. 

Upon entry to the house, SCP-4439 was discovered to have spread over most of the building's interior, covering its walls, floorboards and ceilings. The bedroom on the second floor appeared to be its point-of-origin.

**Conducting Interviewer:** Project Lead, Dr. Wu

**Interviewees:** Mr and Mrs Brown, Tenants
> 
> **Mr Brown:** What's the meaning of this? You can't just kick us out of our own house!
> 
> **Dr. Wu:** Mr and Mrs Brown, what can you tell me about the stain on your second-floor bedroom wall?
>  
> **Mr Brown:** What? That darn thing? We tried cleaning it off multiple times, but what's that got to do with anything? 
> 
> **Mrs Brown:** Is this what the quarantine's for? It's a lot of fuss for a little mold on the wall, no? Is it infectious?
> 
> **Mr Brown:** You should have just scrubbed it with acid like I told you to, ███████.
>  
> **Dr. Wu:** Can either of you recall when the stain first appeared?
> 
> **Mr Brown:** It was about two weeks ago, when we—
> 
> <Mrs Brown suddenly looks upset, repeatedly glancing down at the table.>
> 
> **Mr Brown:** When we got home. I have no idea how it got there, do you, ███████?
> 
> <Mrs Brown shakes her head.>
> 
> **Dr. Wu:** I understand it's your first trimester check-up with Dr Philips, is that correct, Mrs Brown?
> 
> **Mrs Brown:** T—That's right. But why—
> 
> **Mr Brown:** Why do you need to know?
> 
> **Dr. Wu:** Mr Brown, if you would let your wife answer the question, please.
> 
> **Mr Brown:** No, goddamnit, we're not saying another word until you tell us what's going on!
> 
> **Mrs Brown:** Please, ████. We should just tell them what happened!
> 
> **Mr Brown:** Or you could just shut the hell up. You want to go to jail, is that it?
> 
> **Dr. Wu:** I assure you that neither of you are in trouble with the law... at least not yet. But that's dependent on your cooperation at this juncture of the investigation. 
> 
> <Mr Brown takes a deep breath, calms down.>
> 
> **Mr Brown:** Dr Philips. She's our—
> 
> **Mrs Brown:** My gynecologist. 
> 
> **Dr. Wu:** And how far along are you, Mrs Brown?
> 
> **Mrs Brown:** A— About three months. Counting last week.
> 
> **Dr. Wu:** And what did Dr Philips say about the condition of your baby during your last visit?
> 
> <The couple stare at each other for a long moment. Mr Brown throws up his hands in resignation.>
> 
> **Mrs Brown:** There were... some complications.

**Foreword:** The ██████ family resides in a two-story townhouse across the road from SCP-4439. The following are surveillance logs pieced together a day after the Browns were evicted from their house. Research Task Force (RTF) "Legrasse" on standby in case of emergency.
>  
**CAMERA 1:** Footage captured from roadside camera, wide-angle of the street. Time-stamps as follows:
> 
> **15:01:** A boy, around 10 years of age, dribbles a basketball in the direction of the anomalous house. 
> 
> **15:05:** The boy pauses near the front porch, turns to stare at the front door. Later, during interrogation, the boy claims to have heard the faint cry of a baby coming from within the house.
> 
> **15:07:** The boy circles the exterior of the house at least three times, occasionally peering into windows.
> 
> **15:15:** The boy climbs into a window on the first floor that appears to be only half-boarded up.
> 
> **Note:** At this point, RTF's request to intervene denied by Project Lead, Dr. Wu.

**CAMERA 2:** Footage from internal security camera installed by Foundation agents. Living room visible from top-down angle. Stairs to the second floor on the right. 
> 
>  **15:15:** The boy comes into view as he climbs in one of the windows in the back, approaches the camera through the hallway. No other movement detected.
> 
> **15:18:** The boy climbs up the stairs to the second floor.
> 
> **15:20:** The boy reaches the top of the stairs, turns to his right, then freezes. He remains transfixed and unmoving for approximately 3 minutes and 20 seconds. It is not clear whether his paralysis is voluntary.
> 
> **15:23:** The boy collapses to the ground, apparently unconscious. His basketball bounces down the flight of stairs and then off-camera.
> 
> **Note:** Second request to intervene by RTF personnel denied by Dr. Wu, citing experiment integrity. The boy remains prone and stationary for another 5 minutes and 15 seconds. 
> 
**CAMERA 3:** Footage from internal security camera in bedroom suspected to be point-of-origin for SCP-4439.
> 
> **15:23**: White noise and static.
> 
**CAMERA 1:** 
> 
> **Note:** Dr. Wu's order to stand down countermanded by RTF Commander R.L. Weir, who orders immediate extraction of the boy.
> 
> **15:21:** RTF personnel deploy from the garage and backyard.
> 
**CAMERA 2:**
> 
> **15:22:** RTF personnel enter the house through the front door, extract the boy from the top of the stairs. No other signs of life detected.
> 
> [FOOTAGE ENDS] 
> 
**Dr. Wu's Remarks:** An unofficial test-log was initiated when Jimmy ██████, 10-years-old, happened to wander into the building containing SCP-4439. Test subject claims to have heard a baby's cry that intensified as he ventured deeper into the house. Upon reaching the second floor, he saw a black mass "squirming" in the bedroom, followed by a sharp, throbbing pain in his head. Subject remained unconscious for 22 minutes, 30 seconds. Working theory is that SCP-4439 has amplified effect on children in close proximity.
> 
**Commander Weir's Notes:** After extraction, RTF medics reported no other injuries on Jimmy ██████. Recommend immediate reinforcement of the site's exterior to prevent future containment breach. Formal complaint to be logged against Dr. Wu for delayed endangerment of a member of public.

**Foreword:** SCP-4439 was isolated for another 24 hours before D-9455 was introduced into controlled environment. Footage from shoulder-mounted camera with Project Lead, Dr. Wu, feeding instructions via headset. Commander Weir, from RTF "Legrasse", supervising. D-9455 is female, 35, transferred from [REDACTED].
> 
> **D-9455:** Shit, why don't the lights work in here?
> 
> **CDR Weir:** D-9455, use your flashlight and proceed. 
> 
> **Dr. Wu:** Can you tell us what you see?
> 
> **D-9455:** Nothing much. I'm in the living room now. What am I supposed to be looking for exactly?
> 
> **Dr. Wu:** Please focus on the walls. What do you see?
> 
> **D-9455:** They're covered in some black… stuff. Looks like mold. A whole lot of it.
> 
> **Dr. Wu:** Proceed to the second floor when ready.
> 
> <Parts of the stairwell illuminated by D-9455's light source. She moves slowly.>
> 
> **D-9455:** Now what? You're gonna tell me some ghost stories, Doc?
> 
> **CDR Weir:** Keep it clinical, D-9455.
> 
> **Dr. Wu:** Down the hallway, to your right. You should see a bedroom.
> 
> **D-9455:** Yeah? Looks like it. Broken cot. Peeling wallpaper. Used to be unicorns and rainbows.
> 
> **Dr. Wu:** And what do the walls look like in here?
> 
> **D-9455:** Shit, doc. You got some refurbishment team coming in later or what? What's this obsession with the wallpaper?
> 
> **CDR Weir:** Approach the wall directly in front of you, D-9455. Is there anything different about this room?
> 
> **D-9455:** Shit, //everything// looks fucked up in here, boss. It's not just one wall. **All** of 'em look infected.
> 
> **Dr. Wu:** What do you mean?
> 
> **D-9455:** The black stuff— it's everywhere. Mold isn't supposed to look like that... right?
> 
> **Dr. Wu:** Like what?
> 
> **D-9455:** Like... it's constantly shifting. Eyeballin' me wherever I go.
> 
> <D-9455 leans in to examine the easternmost wall of the room>
> 
> **CDR Weir:** Be careful, D-9455. Don't get too close.
> 
> **D-9455:**: Smells bad too. Metallic. Like blood.
> 
> **Dr. Wu:** Reach out and touch it, D-9455, if you would please.
> 
> **CDR Weir:** (off-mic) What, are you cra—?!
> 
> <D-9455 scrapes off a bit of the black stain with a finger.>
> 
> **D-9455:** It's wet. Like it's streaming down the walls.
> 
> <D-9455 suddenly recoils.>
> 
> **D-9455:** Fucking hell!?
> 
> **CDR Weir:** D-9455, what is it?
> 
> <Static except for D-9455's heavy breathing. On the camera feed, a lone circle of light flashes rapidly across all four walls of the bedroom.>
> 
> **D-9455:** It's moving! The black shit's moving everywhere! Shit, what the hell's happening??
> 
> **Dr. Wu:** A very interesting reaction to human touch.
> 
> **CDR Weir:** Get outta there, D-9455. That's an order.
> 
> **Dr. Wu:** No, right where you are. Are you able to tell us which direction the black stain is moving in?
> 
> **D-9455:** Fuck if I care! I'm guessing this ain't normal-fucking-mold-on-the-wall, is it??
> 
> **CDR Weir:** (off-mic) Dr. Wu, I //highly// recommend we extract our asset. She's going to—
> 
> **Dr. Wu:** Listen carefully, D-9455. I want you to remain in the center of the room and stay completely still. Can you do that?
> 
> **D-9455:** Fuck this. I'm not staying in this house another minute!
> 
> **Dr. Wu:** D-9455, look at your finger. Do it now.
> 
> <Panicked breathing continues. D-9455 holds up her finger to the camera. A small patch of black mold can be seen on her fingertip; it doesn't appear to be moving. D-9455 is visibly shaking.>
> 
> **Dr. Wu:** You see? Everything's fine. 
> 
> **D-9455:** Everything's NOT fine, doc. Get me the fuck outta here!
> 
> <Incomprehensible static. Loud voices argue off-mic.>
> 
> **CDR Weir:** D-9455, you are to remain in the testing area as long as instructed, as discussed by your terms of employment and under the sole direction of Project Lead, Dr. Wu.
> 
> **D-9455:** What?? For how fucking long??
> 
> **Dr. Wu:** (pause) Another 24 hours, if you would be so kind.
> 
**Dr. Wu's Remarks:** Remainder of footage tracks SCP-4439 shrinking into a corner of the room whilst in the physical presence of the D-9455. Further reports of a baby's cries were uncorroborated through electronic observation. No other effects observed on D-9455 for the next 24 hours. Motion to dismiss official protest by Commander R.L. Weir, who claims that D-9455 was placed at unnecessary risk throughout the experiment.

**Conducting Interviewer:** Project Lead, Dr. Wu

**Interviewees:** Mr and Mrs Brown, Prior Tenants

**Additional Note:** Commander Weir and the rest of RTF "Legrasse" discharged from active duty three days in advance.
> 
> **Dr. Wu:** Thank you very much for agreeing to speak with us again.
> 
> **Mr Brown:** (scoffs) Like we had a choice.
> 
> **Mrs Brown:** Is everything alright now? Can we return home?
> 
> **Dr. Wu:** Mr and Mrs Brown, I'm sorry to say that a young boy has already been injured on your premises, with a team of professionals having to risk their lives in order to save him. In order to prevent future incidents from occurring, we are placing your residence under permanent quarantine, effective immediately.
> 
> **Mr Brown:** I was under the impression we'd be able to return in the next few days?!
> 
> **Dr. Wu:** I'm afraid your house is no longer safe. And I think the both of you already know the reason why.
> 
> **Mr Brown:** Now what's that supposed to mean?
> 
> **Dr. Wu:** We have indications, Mr Brown, that something happened in the second-floor bedroom the night before the stain appeared. Mrs Brown, may we ask when your next appointment with Dr. Philips is scheduled to take place?
> 
> **Mrs Brown:** Wh— What do you mean? I believe it's in another three months?
> 
> **Dr. Wu:** Curious. When we called her office earlier today, her staff told us that you'd cancelled all of your future appointments.
> 
> **Mr Brown:** I don't like what you're suggesting here.
> 
> <Mrs Brown has a stricken look on her face.>
> 
> **Mrs Brown:** It's— It's the stain, isn't it? You're saying this whole episode has something to do with what happened in the bedroom, that night we—!
> 
> **Mr Brown:** Be quiet, woman!
> 
> **Mrs Brown:** This is all our fault, ████! We shouldn't have— we shouldn't have done it!
> 
> <Mrs Brown turns to Dr. Wu.>
> 
> **Mrs Brown:** Please, you have to understand! It was all Dr. Philips'— she said our baby wouldn't survive past the three-month mark. We didn't want any of this to happen!
> 
>  **Dr. Wu:**: While I'm genuinely sorry for your lost, Mrs Brown, at this point, the best course of action is for you to vacate the premises and let us make the necessary arrangements.
> 
> **Mrs Brown:** No... At least tell me... My baby— my sweet angel— he's okay? He's really alive? Can I see him one last time?
> 
> **Mr Brown:** What the hell are you talking about, ███████??
> 
> **Dr. Wu:** I'm afraid contact with your son would be inadvisable, Mrs Brown. I suggest we put the past behind us and move on.
> 
>  **Mr Brown:** You're //both// crazy if you think I'm leaving the house for a few shit stains on the wall!
> 
> [END LOG]

**Dr. Wu's Remarks:** Because of high risk of containment breach, Class C amnestics administered to both Mr and Mrs Brown before their permanent relocation to [REDACTED]. Note: Mrs Brown reported to be expecting a second child. Recommend close monitoring and intervention in case of further anomalous activity.
