Howdy, Y'all! Welcome to Site-71, or "The Farm" as we like to say. I'm DrAkimoto, I'm not one to talk about myself but here are some things I'm into.
* Goats
* Donks
* Other animals
* Space stuff
* All sorts of music
* Farming
* Art
* Orange Juice
* Chickens
I'm sure there's other stuff but who cares!
