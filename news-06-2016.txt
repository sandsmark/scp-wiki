Welcome to this installment of site news, where you discover a cave and enter it, on the search for unknown treasures. All you need is one last haul of treasure to secure your family another night in the cold, upcoming winter, no matter how dangerous the search for it may be.

This is a series showing off news from the site, articles from the past month, and fan-content for you to check out and discover! Be sure to leave a comment with your thoughts!

+++ On-Site News

++++ Featured Articles

* The featured articles for this month are [[[SCP-2814]]] ("Heretic of the Torch") by [[*user Anborough]] and [[[Wanderer Symbols]]] by [[*user toadking07]]. One's about a mask that gives its wielder the power of a false god, and the other is about secret symbols used by the Wanderer's Library. Check them out!
* The featured articles from last month were [[[SCP-2127]]] ("Hinterkai-fun!") by [[*user fastandbulbous]] and [[[Footsteps]]] by [[*user Anborough]]. One's about a murder mystery placed on a grave for passerby to solve, and the other is about a son lashing out to his dad for following in his path. Check them out!

++++ Event-Featured Articles

* June 1st was International Children's Day! Children are the driving force for our future, and their creativity and worth should be celebrated. [[*user PeppersGhost]] gave us an answer; have them come up with horrifying abominations. [[[scp-1293|Squeedle Deedle Dee!]]]
* June 19th was Father's Day! A time to celebrate with your father, or if you don't have one/estranged from one, anyone who's a suitable fatherly figure to you. (I hear Wal-Mart sells dads now for free over the holidays.) [[*user dierubikdie]] came up with a solution; the [[[scp-2053|Paternal Rubik's Cube]]], a dad who trapped himself inside a Rubik's Cube to be closer to his puzzle-loving son. Oof.
* June 30th was Meteor Watch Day! A great occasion to sit outside and watch the stars, hoping to spot a passing meteor burn in the atmosphere. But if you spot a particularly nasty one, one that looks adorned with a sense of elegance, well, you're screwed. But you can also thank [[[A Fancy Dinosaur]]] for ordering it courtesy of [[*user TwistedGears]].

++++ Rest of the News

* In the time since the last post and now, [[*user Mistbourne]] has stepped up from Junior Staff to Operational. Give him a warm welcome :)

+++ Fandom Stuff

What's been going on in the community aside from our site? Well...

* Couldn't find anything for June, my bad. Feel free to send me anything from June if you happen to know of anything, or even for July for next month's edition. Hell, I accept submissions every month : )

++++ Fanart

First off, again, I must bring up that the [http://ja.scp-wiki.net/ Japanese Branch] held an art contest with lots of awesome art in all styles and genres that you should be look at. Check it out [http://ja.scp-wiki.net/2016-illust-contest here]. To use this section to show off the art from there would be a disservice to other artists, so I'll link a few more:

* [http://ja.scp-wiki.net/foundation-or-goi-logo These logos] by user [[*user Nanimono Demonai]] are incredibly professional-looking and Hell, if I write something for the GOC, I'd even think of using that logo! And in the joke category, [http://ja.scp-wiki.net/foundation-sign these signs] (also by Nanimono Demonai) are both incredibly funny and also very useful to understand, even if you don't know any Japanese.
* munlmu is a mainstay in this section, but can you blame me with the continious amount of fantastic art that they do? For example, this adorably cute comic about [http://ja.scp-wiki.net/littlewitch SCP-239] which won its category in the comic section, and you can see why. The cute......
* And finally, my last pick from that art contest... SCP-2317 is a scary article, isn't it? What's the only way to make it scarier? Maybe by seeing what [http://ja.scp-wiki.net/the-devourer The Devourer] looks like. Thank you [[*user kotarou611]] for the awesome picture! And the nightmares.
* Personifications are always fun, and I love seeing how people interpret non-humanoid anomalies as, well, humanoid. For this month, have [http://suzumeoisii.tumblr.com/post/145751330199/scp-2237代償は常に付き物だ著者-agent-macleod SCP-2237] by [http://suzumeoisii.tumblr.com/ suzumeoisii]!
* Oh right, we were looking at nice, cute stuff. Hey, do you remember how scary SCP-610 is? [http://jasavel.deviantart.com/ jasavel] has you covered with an [http://jasavel.deviantart.com/art/SCP-610-The-Flesh-That-Hates-616039754 infected person]. Yikes!
* No, too much? Well, [http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&illust_id=57431550 this log of SCP critters] (with 2521 being the leader of the pack here) courtesy of [http://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=402057 真ん中ＣＵＢＥ]. That oughta help.
* Because everything on the internet has to interact with Touhou at some point, we eventually end up with an adorable crossover of [http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&illust_id=57411935 Koishi Komeiji and SCP-131] by artist [http://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=1625466 katabee].
* You don't need to understand Japanese to get [http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=manga&illust_id=57249811 this comic] by artist [http://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=15521968 飛鳥] about [[[SCP-531]]], an oldie but a goodie. Just imagining being in that position... brrr.
* And to round out the metric fuckton of art I bestow upon you all this week, have [http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&illust_id=57293641 another giant log of art] by [http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&illust_id=57293641 眞田居間]. If I could, I'd feature them every month. From various 001 proposals to [[[SCP-2454]]], so many cool personifications and interpretations.

Thanks for tuning in again, folks! Hey, listen, before you go; if you write an article and it sticks, //please// send me a blurb for your article. I may or may not use it (if I can think of something more attention-getting, though I'll try to stick with one you give me) but I really would just like them in order to make the process easier for making these. In addition, this is a community thing, and I want authors to give their blurbs to sell these articles much easier. It reduces the workload I and the people helping me have to do, and helps the news come out that much earlier!

Thank you ARD and rumetzen for helping me out! Fuck, seriously, thank you. I, Decibelle, as always, did the intro and outro bits myself (AKA the stuff you don't read these for).

Furthermore, if you guys would like to see an art contest on the site, let me know! It's something that seems like the community would benefit from, though the more people who would be willing to enter, the better. Thank you all for continuing to be an excellent community <3
