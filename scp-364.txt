**Item #:** SCP-364

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** At current technology levels, SCP-364 cannot be reached by humans, let alone be physically contained, and thus containment measures consist primarily of finding and suppressing any information about SCP-364 before such information can be publicly disseminated. Foundation assets have been inserted into all major space agencies and most private space exploration companies, with standing orders to report to Overwatch any actions planned or being carried out that could potentially expose SCP-364. A task force has also been set up to monitor actions by amateur astronomers, although the chances of independent discovery of SCP-364 from ground-based installations are quite small.

**Description:** SCP-364 is a point several hundred meters above the volcano Surt on Io, the innermost of Jupiter’s Galilean satellites. At irregular intervals, varying amounts of material (up to 4000 cubic meters at a time) spontaneously appear at this location and settle to the surface of Io, presumably to be incinerated by the lava flow at the surface. The mechanism by which this material appears is not known, and no permanent physical structure has as yet been detected near SCP-364, at any other location on Io, or anywhere else in the Jovian system.

The existence of SCP-364 was first suggested in 1979, following the fly-by of Jupiter by the //Voyager 1// probe. Unusual activity on Io had been picked up by [DATA EXPUNGED], part of a clandestine package of instruments added to both //Voyager 1// and //Voyager 2// by Foundation assets. However, the existence of SCP-364 could not be confirmed until the //Galileo// probe reached Jupiter in December 1995, using data and images collected by //Galileo// during its initial pass of Io. None of these images or data were released, the official story being that no images were taken in the first place.

While //Galileo// was left to continue its original mission around Jupiter, Foundation personnel worked with high-ranking NASA officials to develop and launch two more probes to Io, specifically to study and monitor SCP-364. However, to avoid suspicion, these missions to Io were announced and treated as exploratory missions to Mars. In late 1999, both the Mars Climate Orbiter and the Mars Polar Lander appeared to crash land on Mars due to "human error", when in actuality both spacecraft continued on their way to Io, reaching Jupiter in 2007. //Galileo// had already been sent to its destruction in Jupiter’s atmosphere by this time, but the two "Mars" probes continue to send back data from Io and SCP-364. The replacements for these probes are already [DATA EXPUNGED].

**Addendum, 02/13/2010:** A strong correlation has been discovered between the thermal output of Surt and the appearance of material at SCP-364. However, any potential causative relationship between the two phenomena is purely speculative.
