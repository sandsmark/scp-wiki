[[/div]]

**Name:** Doctor Michael Magnus 

**Position:** N/A

**Security Clearance:** N/A

**Status:** Deceased

**History:** Doctor Magnus acquired by the Foundation after having applied for a research position in the Soap From Corpses Products company, and passing the standard battery of tests of researchers. Date of birth on record was inconsistent with chronological appearance by a large margin.  Actual date of birth came under speculation early within his employment, but he maintained to be 78 years of age at this time, though he appeared to be a normal 27 year old male, both visually, and through standard tests.

Posthumous record analysis revealed that Doctor Magnus was a pathological liar, many of his claimed research topics having been physically impossible. His age was confirmed upon his death at 27 years, six months.  Speculation as to the nature of his work was also disproved as sleight of hand, and classical showmanship techniques.  Hiring procedures, as well as the hiring staff that acquired Doctor Magnus were reviewed, and an official reprimand was issued.  

Doctor Magnus claimed to have a degree in "Metaphysics" from the University of [REDACTED]. How this didn't come up in his interview is unknown.  After contacting the University, it was later discovered that Michael Magnus graduated with a bachelor's degree in Psychology in [REDACTED].No security breaches have been discovered to date as a result of Doctor Magnus' employment, but investigations are still underway.

Doctor Magnus was KIA during a Chaos Insurgency raid on [REDACTED] after sustaining several stab wounds.  Doctor Magnus had not had any formalized combat training, and attempted to engage in hand-to-hand combat with a trained Chaos Insurgency operative.  He is currently buried in [REDACTED], Delaware, in accordance with his will.
