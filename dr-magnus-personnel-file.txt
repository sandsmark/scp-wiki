[[/div]]

**Name:** Doctor Michael Magnus
**Position:** Head of Metaphysical Research at site 22
**Security Clearance:** Level 3
**History:**  Acquired by the foundation after having applied for a research position in the Soap From Corpses Products company, when the date of birth he wrote down would have made him seventy seven years old at the time.  This was later confirmed through polygraph tests, and interviews with the Doctor.  Actual date of birth has come under speculation as of late, but he is confirmed through his own accounts to be 78 years of age at this time, though he appears to be a normal 21 year old male.  After the events of incident TD/H, his aging process has begun again, and is for all intents and purposes a normal adult male. [DETAILS OF INCIDENT TD/H CLASSIFIED BY 05 ORDER]

Doctor Michael Magnus is currently MIA in the Australian Outback.  Search teams have been sent out, but due to the Doctor's prodigious production of meta-physical technology, results are not positive yet.  It is believed that he left of his own volition, and as such is currently under review for termination.
