**Name:** Doctor Michael Magnus 
**Position:** Head of Metaphysical Research at site 22
**Security Clearance:** Level 3
**History:**  Acquired by the foundation after having applied for a research position in the Soap From Corpses Products company, when the date of birth he wrote down would have made him seventy seven years old at the time.  This was later confirmed through polygraph tests, and interviews with the Doctor.  Actual date of birth has come under speculation as of late, but he is confirmed through his own accounts to be 78 years of age at this time, though he appears to be a normal 21 year old male.

Doctor Michael Magnus was KIA during the TD/H incident on [REDACTED BY O5 ORDER].  He was buried in [REDACTED], and his will was executed by Doctor Christopher Zartion.
