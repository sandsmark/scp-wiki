[[/div]]

**Name:** Doctor Michael Magnus 
**Position:** Head of Metaphysical Research at site 22
**Security Clearance:** Level 3
**History:**  Acquired by the foundation after having applied for a research position in the Soap From Corpses Products company. Date of birth on record was inconsistent with chronological appearance by a large margin.  This was later confirmed through polygraph tests, and interviews with the Doctor.  Actual date of birth has come under speculation as of late, but he is confirmed through his own accounts to be 78 years of age at this time, though he appears to be a normal 27 year old male.

Later record analysis revealed that Doctor Magnus was a pathological liar, and his age was confirmed upon his death at 27 years, six months.  Speculation as to the nature of his work was also disproved as sleight of hand, and classical showmanship techniques.

Doctor Michael Magnus was KIA during the TD/H incident on [REDACTED BY O5 ORDER].  After autopsy, his body was buried in [REDACTED].
**Currently researching the following SCP's:**
[[[SCP-773]]]
[[[SCP-845]]]
