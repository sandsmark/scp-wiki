**Item #:** SCP-1959

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** As of this writing, SCP-1959 is yet to be contained. Amnesiac is to be administered to every civilian witness of each sighting. Should it be captured, a specialized containment unit has been set aside at Site-██. No personnel with Russian as their first language or born in Russia are allowed within 50 meters of SCP-1959.

**Description:** SCP-1959 is an unmarked white space suit, similar in make to Soviet's SK-1 model used in Vostok Program with few alterations. The suit itself appears to be indestructible. The helmet's visor is badly damaged and misted over, preventing any observation of its interior. All attempts to communicate with SCP-1959 have failed. While the subject is capable of independent movement, it remains motionless most of the time unless prompted. On the occasion the subject does move without stimuli, its body language shows signs of extreme distress and it will sometimes make attempts to break its visor. SCP-1959 emits considerable amounts of gamma-radiation.

SCP-1959 appears to continuously orbit around the Earth in an irregular trajectory at reasonably constant speed through an unknown mean. The altitude in which SCP-1959 orbit the earth varies from a meter above sea level to High Earth Orbit. Subject would often ram through any obstacle it encountered, causing grave structural damage. It will alter its path if there is a barrier with sufficient mechanical strength in its trajectory. There are recorded instances where SCP-1959 hovered in place for a certain period of time before moving off again. According to witnesses’ account to such events, the subject appears to be resisting some unseen force before being pulled away.

If an individual comes too close with SCP-1959’s path, there is a chance that the subject would grab them as it passes. It should be noted that subject is capable of taking several people in one pass. No survivor from such incident has been recorded.
 
**Addendum-01:** SCP-1959 was first observed floating in the Low Earth Orbit by the crew aboard [REDACTED] on ██/██/████. Observation lasted for three hours before the crew members lost sight of the subject. Numerous observations of SCP-1959 had been made since. View Document 1959-#1 for full list of SCP-1959 sighting.

**Addendum-02:** //”Further research shows that the victims all were born in Russia or had Russian as their first language. This finding should be incorporated into the subject's containment protocol."//---Agent ███████
