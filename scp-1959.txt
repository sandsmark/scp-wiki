**Item #:** SCP-1959

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** As of this writing, SCP-1959 is yet to be contained. Amnesiac is to be administered to every civilian witness of each sighting. Should it be captured, a specialized containment unit has been set aside at Site-██. No personnel with Russian as their first language or born in Russia are allowed within 50 meters of SCP-1959.

**Description:** SCP-1959 is an unmarked white space suit, similar in make to Soviet's SK-1 model used in Vostok Program with few alterations. The helmet's visor is badly damaged and misted over, preventing any observation of its interior. All attempts to communicate with SCP-1959 have failed. While the subject is capable of independent movement, it remains motionless most of the time unless prompted. On the occasion the subject does move without stimuli, its body language shows signs of extreme distress and it will sometimes make attempts to break its visor. SCP-1959 emits considerable amounts of gamma-radiation

SCP-1959 appears to continuously orbit around the Earth in an irregular trajectory at reasonably constant speed through an unknown mean. The altitude in which SCP-1959 orbit the earth varies from a meter above sea level to High Earth Orbit. Subject would often ram through any obstacle it encountered, causing grave structural damage. It will alter its path if there is a barrier with sufficient mechanical strength in its trajectory. There are recorded instances where SCP-1959 hovered in place for a certain period of time before moving off again. According to witnesses’ account to such events, the subject appears to be resisting some unseen force before being pulled away.

If an individual comes too close with SCP-1959’s path, there is a chance that the subject would grab them as it passes. It should be noted that subject is capable of taking several people in one pass. No survivor from such incident has been recorded.
 
**Addendum-01:** SCP-1959 was first observed floating in the Low Earth Orbit by the crew aboard [REDACTED] on ██/██/████. Observation lasted for three hours before the crew members lost sight of the subject. Numerous observations of SCP-1959 had been made since. View Document 1959-#1 for full list of SCP-1959 sighting.

**Addendum-02:** //”Further research shows that the victims all were born in Russia or had Russian as their first language. This finding should be incorporated into the subject's containment protocol."//---Agent ███████

██/██/████: Subject made a low-altitude pass over █████, Belgium and caused significant structural damage to five multi-story buildings. Three casualties were reported. Amnesiac was successfully administered to witness 
//I swear, it was as if this thing is trying to make itself known once it realize that we’re watching it.//-- Dr. ██████

██/██/████: SCP-1959 was observed by the crew of [REDACTED] in High Earth Orbit for approximately 201 minutes. Subject collided with a satellite, causing a communication blackout on the US Western Seaboard. Amnesiac was successfully administered to each witness upon their return to earth.
██/██/████: An observatory in ██████, Germany tracked SCP-1959 passing in Low Earth Orbit for approximately 30 minutes. Amnesiac was successfully administered to all witnesses.
██/██/████: Subject was sighted by the passengers of Flight-███ at approximately 35,000 meter. Observation lasted for approximately 21 minutes before Flight-███ pulled away and passengers lost sight of SCP-1959. Amnesiac has been successfully administered to each witness.

[[collapsible show="Interview Log 1959-WA1"]]
**Interviewed:** Asif █████
**Interviewer:** Dr. Z. ██████
**Foreword:** Interview with Mr. █████, a witness of SCP-1959 ‘hover’ event.

**<Begin Log>**

**Dr. Z. ██████:** “Good day, Mr. █████. How are you today?”

**Mr. █████:** “O…okay, I guess.”

**Dr. Z. ██████:** “Pleasantries aside, let’s talk about what you see at ██/██/████.

**Mr. █████:** [Look scared and stuttering] P...p…please, I got nine kids.”

**Dr. Z. ██████:** [Gently] “Mr.  █████… Asif, your fate is not mine to decide. However, if you answer my question satisfactorily, this interview will just be another bad dream.”

**Mr. █████:** “Y…you can do that?”

**Dr. Z. ██████:** [Nod] Now, can you describe what you were doing at ██/██/████ prior to the sighting?”

**Mr. █████:** “Uh… um… well… I was out on the field that afternoon. You know, after checking the chicken fence and such. So, I was walking back to my home through the field when I start feeling something funny on my skin and smell this awful burning smell. Then I saw this man, all white, standing some distance away on my field. I thought it was some asshole arsonist torching my field so I run over and… you know the rest.”

**Dr. Z. ██████:** “Can you describe what you see?”

**Mr. █████:** Well, it was a guy… in a suit or something. All white, no marking, no nothing. Can’t see what’s inside because his helmet all misted over, and he was… get this, //floating// over my field . //Floating//! Like David [EXPLETIVE] Copperfield or something. And he was... uh, doing dog paddle mid-air, like he’s fighting with something that was pulling him, waving his arm in the air and reaching out, like he’s asking for help or something.

**Dr. Z. ██████:** “So what did you do?”

**Mr. █████:** “What else!? I just sat there, with actual poop in my pants, watching this floating space-guy just flailing there, like he’s really, //really// desperate to stay in that one spot. He was bashing his own head too with one hand, like he wanted to break that helmet of his. Then he suddenly jerked backward and jetted away, like a rag-doll being fired from a slingshot.”

**Dr. Z. ██████:** “Hmm… I see. Thank you for your cooperation, Mr. █████.”

**<End Log>**

**Closing Statement:** Class-A Amnesiac was administered to Mr. Asif █████ after the interview and returned back to his home the following day. Mr. █████’s medical report showed that he suffered a light case of gamma-radiation burn on his epidermis.
