    **Item #:** SCP-566

    **Object Class:** Safe

    **Special Containment Procedures:** The base of SCP-566 is to be welded to the wall of a 2m-by-2m room constructed of [REDACTED]. A hinged black metal lid will be welded over it to prevent unauthorized exposure to the SCP. The room itself needs no lock, though the lid will be secured by a retinal scanner.

    **Description:** SCP-566 appears to be a standard 20██ desk calendar with one page for each day except March 15, which had been half-torn away upon Foundation discovery. The text is, at first glance, similar to that found on the pages of a "word-a-day" calendar, except that the provided "words" do not exist. However, if one reads the definitions provided, SCP-566 implants a suggestion into the reader's mind.

Thereafter, the reader will seek every opportunity to use that "word" in conversation. Confusion in other listeners is met with the reader's insistence that it //is// a word, and that the listener "should look it up". Each attempt to "educate others" of the "word" makes the initial reader more frustrated and angry, until eventually (in practice, two hundred attempts) the reader goes violently insane. If not subdued, the reader becomes mindlessly violent, screaming the "word" repeatedly; even after subdual and sedation, the reader continues to mutter it.

SCP-566 was discovered in a [DATA EXPUNGED] in Rome, Italy, amid numerous corpses. When asked of the March 15 page, the [REDACTED] stated that it "had been burned for safety", and refused to divulge anything more.
