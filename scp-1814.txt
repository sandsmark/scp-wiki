**Item #:** SCP-1814

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1814 is to be kept in a vacuum jar made of Lead-Glass-Compound-6 at all times, except during testing procedures. This jar is to be contained in a standard Class-3 airtight containment chamber, the only entrance being a double-seal airlock. The jar must be free of any oxygen or other stray gases. The glass must be continually monitored for cracks, chips, or fractures. If any of these are noticed, the room must be immediately evacuated of gas, utilizing a large one-way air turbine in the ceiling above the jar, and the glass must be replaced by D-class subjects wearing pressurized HAZMAT suits and respirators. Failure to contain SCP-1814 will result in [DATA EXPUNGED] and must be avoided at all costs. Subjects with respiratory disorders or conditions are not to be allowed into SCP-1814's chamber without a note from a doctor with Class-4 clearance or higher. Subjects exposed to SCP-1814-2 in an oxygenated environment must be immediately and forcefully deoxygenated, even if it results in the subject's death. As a precaution, all subjects entering SCP-1814's chamber must undergo psych evaluation to detect pyromaniac tendencies. Such subjects are to be terminated with prejudice.

**Description:** SCP-1814 is composed of two pieces, usually in contact with each other. These are denoted SCP-1814-1 and SCP-1814-2. 

SCP-1814-1 is a pedestal made of petrified spruce wood, triangular in shape and around 7cm tall by 18.5cm to a side. It has six legs, one on each corner and one in the middle of each side. It is carved in an ornate style similar to works produced by the ████ Dynasty in China. Despite this, radiometric dating has found it to be at least █████ years older than such a style would suggest. appears to be unaffected by the nature of SCP-1814-2. At all times it is slightly warm to the touch.

SCP-1814-2, when in the absence of oxygen, is a complex and random arrangement of pumice stones that resembles a sculpture of a burning flame. However, when in the presence of oxygen, SCP-1814-2 begins to move and shift, cracking, shattering and reforming, until it achieves a state of intense motion exactly like that of an actual fire. SCP-1814-2 in this state is hot to the touch but does not betray its heat through visual or infrared light. At this point, the stone flame will spread in  the same manner as that of a regular fire. As it burns, SCP-1814-2 emits sounds similar to that of an avalanche or grindstone. The sound becomes deeper as larger amounts of SCP-1814-2 are produced. Objects, including life forms, exposed to an oxygenated instance of SCP-1814-2 will quickly catch “on rock,” becoming covered with and consumed by it. Subjects will suffer severe burns equivalent to those sustained after an equal length of exposure to a flame with a temperature of ███°C. Additionally, SCP-1814-2's excess dust may induce asthma attacks in subjects with respiratory conditions, and otherwise causing instances of SCP-1814-2 to burn inside the subjects' lungs and eventually [DATA EXPUNGED] Throughout this, SCP-1814-2 retains the same mass as an equivalent volume of pumice, gradually weighing down the subject as it builds up. 

SCP-1814-2 also acts according to the properties of regular pumice stone. With the speed at which it shifts, SCP-1814-2 scratches subjects' skin raw, then through their muscle tissue, and finally their bone. However, nearly no blood is lost as the intense heat cauterizes the wounds. While still coherent, D-class subjects described this sensation as "like a belt sander" or "[EXPLETIVE] you [EXPLETIVE]ers, get it off!" Subjects eventually die from a combination of extreme pain, blunt force trauma, asphyxiation, and exfoliation.

When all oxygen is removed completely from SCP-1814's environment or used up by SCP-1814-2, all instances of SCP-1814-2 not attached to SCP-1814-1 will die down into “embers” and then turn to pumice dust. Said pumice dust is not dangerous and will not become SCP-1814-2 again. Meanwhile, the instance that is attached to SCP-1814-1 will revert to its original state and shape. At this point, SCP-1814-1 and SCP-1814-2 become impossible to separate without damaging either. Subsequent oxygenation and deoxygenation episodes will reform damaged to SCP-1814-2, but SCP-1814-1 cannot be repaired this way.

**Addendum:** SCP-1814 was recovered in █/██/20██ when an archaeological expedition to a sealed portion of ███████ Cave in A████ K███, Russia yielded fossilized remains described by the archaeologists as “gruesome.” The skeletons of approximately 3 individuals of a previously unknown hominid subspecies were [DATA EXPUNGED], but with only minuscule amounts of pumice dust in the wounds. This struck the archaeologists as odd, as pumice does not occur in significant amounts in that region. Their paper on the discovery was intercepted by SCP informational agents before its publication in ███████ Journal, and the site was closed off under the pretense of "lethal amounts of radiation." Said archaeologists were detained and given class-A amnesiacs as well as a full screen for toxins and pathogens. According to the agents arriving on the scene, SCP-1814 itself had started to burn again once they opened the cave, and using a fire extinguisher they quickly retrieved it to its current location at Site-19. It appears SCP-1814-2 had consumed all oxygen in the cave some time ago, causing it to put itself out; when the cave was opened, new oxygen came in and [DATA EXPUNGED]
