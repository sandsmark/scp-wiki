title:Vizlox's Art Page
I decided to make an art page because why not? 

Most of the art here is probably going to be screenshots / clips from an SCP Animation --I'm working on-- that I need to get back to work on at some point. I also work on two SCP games so I may post some art from that if I can. 

Most of the SCP art I have from before I started that animation are really old and look like shit so I will probably just shove that all in a collapsible as a "see how far I've come" kind of thing.

+++ SCP Pipedream
This is the animation I mentioned earlier. I haven't been keeping track but if I had to guess, I'd say I put 50 to 150 hours into it. I think I started this in early 2018 or late 2017, but I only worked on it on-off for awhile before completely abandoning the project for a few months because I got distracted with other projects. I am hoping to finish up some stuff and get back to work on this so I can finish it and get it out the door.

The basic synopsis of the animation is "Security guard goes on a drug trip". The entertainment is more from the trippy visuals of the animation rather than a story, but I do want to have a story in the background for you to pick up on. Before you ask, no I have never done drugs, other than coffee. 

FYI I am making the animation in ToonBoom, with backgrounds made in Gimp.

Also, I am working on this project by myself, but I want to look into finding voice actors at some point down the line.

This is (as of now) the very first frame of the animation.

The security guard is heavily inspired by the security from containment breach. I would say the background, specifically the texturing, was inspired by how Lord Bung does his backgrounds.

[[collapsible show="SCP-086" hide="Hide"]]
SCP-086 is in the back there along with some miscellaneous shapes and illusions. This is the planned background for a scene near the end of the animation. (I added a border so it meshed better against the white background.)

[[collapsible show="SCP-2146" hide="Hide"]]
This was in that confinement music special so I thought I would try and make it a trend to have in animations for SCP. Gotta include that 2146 reference.

[[collapsible show="SCP-312" hide="Hide"]]
Lucky you! You get to see some actual //animation!// It a bit low res because I cropped it from a larger scene but this is SCP-312 floating around in space. I think one of the frames may have also gotten removed when I converted it to a gif. It looks slightly choppier than in ToonBoom.

[[collapsible show="SCP-Not-A-Real-SCP" hide="Hide"]]
This isn't an SCP on the site. It doesn't have a number. It is an SCP that appears during the first few scenes of the animation. This was a concept art for it, not actually from the animation, which is why it looks a bit pixely.

You could probably guess where the name "Pipe Dream" comes from at this point.

[[collapsible show="Animation Frame" hide="Hide"]]
This is a frame from around the middle of the animation. Go ahead and theorize about what is going on here.

[[collapsible show="Another Animation Frame" hide="Hide"]]
This is another animation frame from one of the trippier parts of the animation. The background is taken from the Mandelbrot set but I need to get higher quality images for that at some point.

+++ SCP Games

I work in the concept art department for SCP Ascension but I don't have anything of my own to show here. All of that is under lock and chain.

I also work on a game called SCP Foundation Command which is pretty early in development. I do graphics for it but most of what I've done so far is concept / placeholder since we are still very early.

The game is similar to Prison Architect except you build an SCP site facility instead of a prison, so of course there has to be D-Class. Here is a mock-up for a D-Class design.

The plan is to have a wide variety of body and face types so most of them won't have an ugly ass chin.

+++ Other SCP stuff

Here is an abandoned animation project called "Project Shotgun". It was going to take place in the Bellerverse but I realized my plans were way too ambitious and unachievable so I abandoned it and reworked a lot of my ideas into Pipe Dream.

There is nothing but a green screen for the second half of the video because I exported the video wrong.

+++ Misc.

[[collapsible show="Jeffeffe" hide="Hide"]]
This isn't an SCP related thing but I am really proud of it and it looks like it could be an SCP so I'm including it on my page.

Also I named it Jeffeffe because I think it's funny.
