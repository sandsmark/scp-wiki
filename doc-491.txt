title:Recovered Documents (Translated into English from Russian)
**Doc-491-1:** Fragments from  the personal diary of Mayor P████ L██████.
> [...] had acted sooner, we would only have lost our village instead of the rest of the world. Though he insists that I have authority over the village, the fact remains that he is in command of the men with weapons while the rest of us are defenseless. Until Captain T██████ conclusively shows that he is no threat, I will continue to withold my trust of him. He has kept a very large secret from us before, after all.

> We have to begin considering how to ration our supplies. We are fortunate that this happened in autumn, allowing us to work with [...]

> [...] brutal than that were the actions of the Captain when he learned of it. I would not call it a trial. Only the Captain spoke, listing off every one of the soldier's faults. He was then left tied in the central square for four hours until the Captain returned with the rest of his men and personally executed him with his own sidearm. His words will never leave me:
> 
> "Stand up! Even if you've never lived like a man, at least die like one! Stand up and look me in the eyes!"
> 
> Could such a ruthless man be trusted to protect the village? Even if it was for the Jewish girl, it may not stop with one death. What will happen if one of us commits a crime against one of the soldiers? Will he demand that they be disposed of in the same way? With all of the armed men under his control, we could do [...]

> 
> [...] dare call me the tyrant! Do they even understand that this was for their own well being? Without my militia, only the Captain wields true power. And, while we continue to consolidate our position, we have to follow the same example that the Captain had made of that traitor of his. It is the only way that we can avoid arousing his suspicion.

**Doc-491-3:** Physical examination of "the Uzbek."
> [...] accustomed to physical labour. Some muscular atrophy has occurred through both lack of use and from advanced age. The two remaining teeth [...] scars along the back which appear to have been from a whip [...] likely not of European or Asian descent.
> 
> Without being familiar with his language, it is not possible to make an accurate assessment of his state of mind. A student of human nature may be able to discern that his actions and demeanor are indicative of a man who is still in full control of his faculties.

> [...] will continue to refer to him as the Uzbek, even if he clearly is not.

> [...] Perhaps I was too hard on him. He did a horrible thing to her, but does that mean that he deserves the things that I had said to him? I know that I'm quick to anger and it's now been said. There is no turning back from that. It's time for me to go back to him and look him in the eyes. I hope that I will be able to see some remorse in them.
