title:Recovered Documents (Translated into English from Russian)
**Doc-491-1:** Fragments from  the personal diary of Mayor Piotr Lazarev.
> [...] had acted sooner, we would only have lost our village instead of the rest of the world. Though he insists that I have authority over the village, the fact remains that he is in command of the men with weapons while the rest of us are defenseless. Until Captain Trubaiev conclusively shows that he is no threat, I will continue to withold my trust of him. He has kept a very large secret from us before, after all.

> We have to begin considering how to ration our supplies. We are fortunate that this happened in autumn, allowing us to work with [...]

> [...] brutal than that were the actions of the Captain when he learned of it. I would not call it a trial. Only the Captain spoke, listing off every one of the soldier's faults. He was then left tied in the central square for four hours until the Captain returned with the rest of his men and personally executed him with his own sidearm. His words will never leave me:
> 
> "Stand up! Even if you've never lived like a man, at least die like one! Stand up and look me in the eyes!"
> 
> Could such a ruthless man be trusted to protect the village? Even if it was for the Jewish girl, it may not stop with one death. What will happen if one of us commits a crime against one of the soldiers? Will he demand that they be disposed of in the same way? With all of the armed men under his control, we could do [...]

> [BETWEEN TEN AND THIRTEEN DAMAGED OR ILLEGIBLE PAGES]
> 
> [...] dare call me the tyrant! Do they even understand that this was for their own well being? Without my militia, only the Captain wields true power. And, while we continue to consolidate our position, we have to follow the same example that the Captain had made of that traitor of his. It is the only way that we can avoid arousing his suspicion.

> And now people are leaving with the Uzbek. The punk and the hippies won't be missed. We can even make do without a few of the families. But, with no engineer, we won't be able to keep the generator [...]

> 
> [...] and the punk managed to escape. The boy probably won't survive if the militia did what they said they did to him. And the Uzbek is too old to cause any further trouble. It's ironic that we have our own secrets to keep from the Captain, now.
> 
> [TWO ILLEGIBLE PAGES AND ONE THAT HAS CLEARLY BEEN TORN OUT]
> 
> [...] The soldiers hate the CAPTAIN as much as I do. Ever since the Jewish girl and the execution, the CAPTAIN had lost all of his power. Another Revolution is about to begin against the CAPTAIN. The village will be free once I'm in [...]

The above document was discovered beneath the floorboards of the Mayor Lazarev's office, thanks to directions provided by the present Mayor Lazarev. Bullet holes and some bone fragments were found in the wall behind the desk.

**Doc-491-2:** Typed memorandum from Nurse Yelena Petruskova to Doctor Vladimir Gierukov.
> [...] Five died during the event. Their names are [DATA REDACTED]. Mister Kravitz died later, before he could receive emergency surgery.
> 
> Eight are wounded. [NAMES AND CONDITIONS REDACTED]
> 
> [ILLEGIBLE] catatonic and unable to move under their own power. Neither suffered any injuries to their heads or bodies.
> 
> [THE REMNANT IS ILLEGIBLE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A HAND-WRITTEN NOTE IN THE MARGIN]
> 
> Thank you, Yelena. Please begin again with the professional tone and language that we had discussed. There is also no need to be redundant in your summaries.

**Doc-491-3:** Physical examination of "the Uzbek."
> [...] accustomed to physical labour. Some muscular atrophy has occurred through both lack of use and from advanced age. The two remaining teeth [...] scars along the back which appear to have been from a whip [...] likely not of European or Asian descent.
> 
> Without being familiar with his language, it is not possible to make an accurate assessment of his state of mind. A student of human nature may be able to discern that his actions and demeanor are indicative of a man who is still in full control of his faculties.
> 
> [DATA REDACTED]
> 
> [...] will continue to refer to him as the Uzbek, even if he clearly is not.

**Doc-491-4:** The remains of the personal log of Captain Julian Trubaiev.
> [ALL PAGES UNTIL THE FINAL OFFICIAL ENTRY ARE ILLEGIBLE FOR THE MOST PART. POSSIBLY PERTINENT WORDS INCLUDE, "DISPLACEMENT", "TOO LATE", "DECEIVED", [DATA REDACTED], AND "SURVIVE"]
> 
> [...] Perhaps I was too hard on him. He did a horrible thing to her, but does that mean that he deserves the things that I had said to him? I know that I'm quick to anger and it's now been said. There is no turning back from that. It's time for me to go back to him and look him in the eyes. I hope that I will be able to see some remorse in them.

> [THE FOLLOWING ENTRY WAS NOT WRITTEN BY CAPTAIN TRUBAIEV'S HAND]
> 
> Thank you. I love you.

> - Magda
> 
> [ALL FURTHER PAGES ARE BLANK EXCEPT FOR THE THIRD FROM THE LAST]
> 
> No remorse. No more entries. If this ends, I don't want to remember it.

**Doc-491-5:** An anonymous journal discovered underneath rubble during the building of a kiosk at Exit Point 2.
> It's becoming insane here. Piotr has become completely unreasonable, hiding behind his thugs while Captain Trubaiev stands by and does nothing. He tried to evacuate us before we were moved. When the airplanes started circling faster, he ran in here with his men and ordered us out. Even if we couldn't get out of ██████ in time, he tried to save us while the rest of the Red Army sat by and waited for us to disappear.
> 
> He also protected the honour of poor Magda, who had already lost her parents when we were moved, after that soldier had his way with her. Nobody is proud to say it, but we were all happy, the moment that he got what he deserved. I only wish he'd died like a dog instead.
> 
> With the curfew and the random searches and the dwindling supplies, I don't understand why we are staying here in this dying village. Only the Uzbek has any sense. He is already getting ready to leave again. Mikhail is planning to go with him. They are good friends, even if they can't understand a thing the other is saying. He even gave the old man his favourite punk rock shirt.

> 
> I have decided to go with the Uzbek. He came from out there in the first place. If anyone can show us how to survive outside of ██████, he can. I know that more will follow us in time. I have already seen other families packing their belongings. Let them come. Piotr and his militia can starve.

**Doc-491-6:** Two messages scratched into the wall of a barricaded room.
> You're the last one. Will you taste as good as the mayor?
> 
> I don't know. But you were definitely no suckling pig.
