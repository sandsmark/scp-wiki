**Item #:** SCP-928

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-928 is kept in a glass viewing case situated at the far end of a 3m x 5m containment room at Site 80. The case can be unlocked by the concurrent use of two keys. These keys are currently held by Researcher Short and Researcher Kaplan. At least two personnel must be present at all times when SCP-928 is being interacted with.

SCP-928 must be monitored with audio and visual surveillance at all times.

All chess moves dictated by SCP-928 must be recorded in Document 928-3. Attempts to reconstruct the game that it is playing are ongoing. 

**Description:** SCP-928 is a slightly discolored white doll made of ceramic and cloth. The eyes of the doll are capable of movement and will usually follow any person in the vicinity. Although the mouth does not move, SCP-928 is capable of producing vocalizations. SCP-928 is otherwise physically unremarkable.

Periodically, SCP-928 will issue commands corresponding to movements in a game of Capablanca chess.[[footnote]]While other variants are possible considering the squares and pieces present, Capablanca Chess is the most widely-known variant that is consistent with known data.[[/footnote]] In most cases, there will be several weeks or months between commands; however, intervals have ranged from three hours to eight years. Commands are not always issued in correspondence with formal chess notation, but are comprehensible.

If a human or canine subject comes within three meters of SCP-928, both the subject and SCP-928 will vanish, with SCP-928 reappearing in the subject's place several seconds later. However, if there is at least one additional human within three meters of the subject, SCP-928 will not exhibit this behavior. It has been speculated that doing so would constitute moving into check, which is an illegal move in a game of chess. Currently, no persons "captured" by SCP-928 have been recovered.

Though technically impossible to confirm, it is generally accepted that SCP-928's commands correspond to movement of "pieces" in the real world, due to the timing of moves made by SCP-928 and the placement of [REDACTED].

**Addendum 928-1:** Partial list of notable vocalizations of SCP-928. 
[[collapsible show="SECURITY LEVEL 2/928 REQUIRED" hide="Security memetic: STOLEN AND HIDDEN"]]
No link has been firmly established between the status of the match SCP-928 is playing and the vocalizations it makes. It is not currently believed to be speaking to its opponent or to Foundation personnel. Vocalizations deemed not notable generally consist of requests for clarification and exchange of pleasantries, and are available in Document 928-6.

|| May 19, 1960 || We are not expecting visitors at any point. ||
|| May 30, 1992 || Such a controlling nature. It should be tamed. ||
|| November 19, 1995 || This code, the cipher can be cracked. ||
|| September 11, 1997 || Shattered to pieces, the princess is unyielding nonetheless. ||
|| January 8, 2005 || Need some help? It's said I'm quite handy. ||
|| October 15, 2006 || You and me should play again some time. ||

Remaining records are sealed until further notice.
