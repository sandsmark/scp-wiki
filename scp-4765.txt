**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4765 is to be stored within a standard containment chamber, located in Storage Site-77's Safe-Class Object wing. Dr. Philip Dedrick’s permission is required for testing of SCP-4765.

**Description:** SCP-4765 is a handheld aluminium mirror with a handle constructed out of black plastic.

When a human becomes aware of their reflection in SCP-4765, it displays its anomalous properties. The subject will manifest signs of heightened levels of self-respect and confidence. The effect is believed to be permanent. However, when SCP-4765 was tested using an adult chimpanzee (an animal believed to be able to recognize its reflection) as the subject, it displayed no observable anomalous effects.

In an attempt to further investigate the properties of SCP-4765, Dr. Dedrick authorised a series of tests:
[[collapsible show="+ Show Test Logs" hide="- ACCESS GRANTED"]]
> **Test 1 - ██/██/15**
> **Subject:** D-41628, a male, age 26 years.
> **Procedure:** D-41628 was instructed to look into the mirrored surface of SCP-4765.
> **Results:** Directly after observing a reflection, the subject's communication with Dr Dedrick became far more varied. The subject’s vocalisations were less submissive, even occasionally questioning the actions of Dr. Dedrick.
> **Analysis:** SCP-4765 appears to increase confidence in conversation. I must test if this effect only applies to conversation, or if it affects other aspects of life.  -Dr. Dedrick.
 
> **Test 2 -██/██/15**
> **Subject:** D-41733, a female, age 33 years. It is important to note that prior to testing, D-41733 displayed a strong aversion to eating in public, believing they appeared “ugly” during the action.
> **Procedure:** D-41733 was instructed to look into the mirrored surface of SCP-4765. After a reflection was observed, she was instructed to eat an apple.
> **Results:** Following the command, D-41733 instantly began to consume the fruit. No signs of reluctance were observed during the test.
> **Analysis:** It appears that SCP-4765 increases the confidence of subjects in multiple ways. This could possibly have applications in several Foundation sites. -Dr. Dedrick.  
 
> //Extraneous tests removed//  
 
> **Test 7 -██/██/15**  
> **Subjects:** SCP-4765.  
> **Procedure:** The mirrored surface of SCP-4765 was struck by a hammer.
> **Results:** After impact, the glass in the mirror shattered. However, it was held within its frame by a transparent layer of plastic, which remained undamaged. Further testing by Dr Dedrick revealed that none of the anomalous properties of the mirror had changed. Therefore, no more testing was required.
> **Analysis:** After my intelligent decision to test the physical properties of SCP-4765, I have revealed that the anomaly is not linked to the presence of a plane mirror, just some form of reflective surface. -Dr. Dedrick, Head Researcher.

Following the comprehensive and successful tests, it was discovered that the properties of SCP-4765 do not relate to the physical appearance of it. In addition, it was discovered that there are no side effects of prolonged exposure to SCP-4765. Therefore, despite what is listed in the Special Containment Procedures, Dr. Dedrick will remain in possession of SCP-4765. He will store it within a locked chamber in his office. This does not cause a security risk, as Dr. Dedrick has displayed extraordinary proficiency in multiple situations relating to security measures in Foundation sites.

**Update: ██/██/15**

Due to the possible risk of compromising security measures, Dr. Dedrick has closed testing applications for SCP-4765. He has also dismissed all other personnel who previously worked with the anomaly, as he is the only person employed at Site-77 with the necessary experience and knowledge of the object.

**Addendum 4765-1 -██/██/15**
I’m fucking sick of this elitist Foundation and their stupid rules. Promoting based on skill, my ass! I could do a better job of running this shithole than every single member of their stuck-up O5 council. If I was in charge, we’d have **zero** containment breaches and everything would be fucking //incredible//. Look at SCP-4765: The tests are //perfect//, the description is conclusive and I don’t expunge any shit that’s actually important. Just because I’m not too chicken to share the entire story from start to finish. Nobody can make SCP files as well as me. You know what? I’m already going to be dismissed, probably terminated, for spreading this knowledge. I might as well lock this page from editing so you inferior assholes don’t delete my magnificent research. Yeah. Fuck you all. I’m immortalising this bitch. Add as much bullshit as you want to the end of this fucking masterpiece, but you can never censor what we all know is the **truth**.  
-Doctor Philip Dedrick, Head Researcher of SCP-4765 and //the greatest doctor alive.//

**Addendum 4765-2: Incident Investigation -██/██/15**  
Directly following the incident displayed in this Object File, Dr. Dedrick was dismissed from his position at Site-77. Due to the possible security risks posed by his dismissal, he was treated with a Class-A amnestics and rehoused a substantial distance from his former place of work. However, prior to his dismissal, Dedrick successfully blocked editing of his work on this page. Due to this, any new information can only be displayed in this addendum.

Due to a lack of knowledge relating to the circumstances leading to the incident, Doctor Santos, the new Head Researcher assigned to SCP-4765, was tasked with searching the office which had previously belonged to Doctor Dedrick for any information which could explain his radical change. During the investigation, Santos discovered a journal which had been kept by Dedrick during his employment at the Foundation. Several relevant entries are displayed below:

Wow, so I’m Head Researcher of a skip now! Maybe it’s a boring, Safe-Class inanimate object, but it’s a skip and it’s mine! I can’t wait to authorise some tests on it!

So, I’m carrying out my first set of tests. They’re going well and are being written up on the log. However, I’ve noticed an issue. I asked for 8 D-Class, but they only sent seven. Not brave enough to complain and I’m pretty sure this anomaly is safe, so I guess I’m carrying out the impact test myself. Don’t let my superiors know!

When I woke up this morning, I felt pretty annoyed about yesterday’s test logs. I’m a head researcher now, I shouldn’t have to hide away and be too scared to call out mistakes. I deserved that 8th D-Class, even if I was clever enough to realise there was no danger from that mirror and I could carry out the test.

I deserve so much better from the Foundation. Why am I only Head Researcher of this one boring skip? I can do so much more. I should at least be in charge of a Keter, if not multiple. I would say it’s their loss, but it’s mine as well. Nobody understands how truly great I am.

Apparently, I have to ‘allow others to help my research’. Fuck that noise! I’m the only person as capable as me. Anybody who helps will just make everything worse. They say that two brains are better than one, but I already have enough brainpower to run this whole foundation. You know what, screw this. I’ll lock editing on SCP-4765’s file so nobody can screw this up. Fuck you, Foundation! You can fire me, but that will be the worst mistake you’ve //ever// made.

During the investigation, Dr. Santos recollected SCP-4765 after locating it within the office. Directly following the conclusion of the investigation and recontainment of SCP-4765, Dr. Santos dismissed all personnel assisting in the investigation, since he is the only person capable enough to contain this anomaly to an acceptable degree. It is not believed that the effects of SCP-4765 caused the incident, as testing by Dr. Santos has not revealed any previously unknown properties of the object. Due to this fact, SCP-4765 will remain as a Safe-Class anomaly.

Incident log compiled by Doctor Santos, Head Researcher of SCP-4765.

**Provisional Containment Procedures -██/██/15**  
SCP-4765 is to be stored within a safe in Head Researcher Santos’ private laboratory. Further testing of SCP-4765 has been deemed unnecessary by Head Researcher Santos, due to the fact that he has already carried out all tests with significant importance. If he believes a test is essential, Head Researcher Santos will perform it alone. Besides Head Researcher Santos, no personnel are allowed contact with SCP-4765, as Head Researcher Santos is the most skilled member of staff in the entirety of Site-77 and is the only researcher who is guaranteed to keep SCP-4765 contained.
