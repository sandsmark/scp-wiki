**Item #:** SCP-789-J

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-789-J is kept in my toilet and only i can talk to it

**Description:** SCP-789-J is a ghost that is a face. it lives in a toilet and it talks to you while you poop. then when you poop it goes "no stop aaaa-" and then stops because there is poop in its mouth.

SCP-789-J travels around in butts. you can only get rid of it by wiping. that is the moral of the story.

sometimes it kills other butts and makes them butt ghosts too. but it is always lonely because it is a butt ghost.

**Addendum:** if you fall in the toilet, it eats your butt.
