**Item #:** SCP-789-J

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-789-J is kept in my toilet and only i can talk to it

**Description:** SCP-789-J is a ghost that is a face. it lives in a toilet and [[[an-excerpt-from-goodbye-ghost|it talks to you while you poop.]]] then when you poop it goes "no stop aaaa-" and then stops because there is poop in its mouth.

SCP-789-J travels around in butts. you can only get rid of it by wiping. [[[to-settle-all-accounts-of-the-butt|that is the moral of the story.]]]

sometimes it kills other butts and makes them butt ghosts too. but it is always lonely because it is a butt ghost.

**Addendum:** if you fall in the toilet, it eats your butt.
