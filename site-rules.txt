title:Site Rules
+ Welcome To The Rules Page!

> * Writing shitty SCPs;
> * Voting on any particular article as an expression of opinion on its quality or merits;
> * Respectful disagreement with staff decisions;
> * Having an unpopular opinion.

-----

+++ Behavior

* **Arguments and Maturity**: You may question the actions of other users and staff as long as it is done in a calm, mature fashion. 

* **Posting:** Do not spam the site with shitty articles. If staff tell you to slow down or stop posting, listen to them. 

* **Comments**: You can comment on any entry provided you are respectful to other users. All comments must follow the [[[Criticism Policy]]]. No personal attacks or trolling.

* **Voting**: You may vote for any reason you like, so long as your reasons are based solely on the content of the article. Do not downvote/upvote based on your opinion of the author, an effort to manipulate averages, or trying to win contests through attrition, as this is considered malicious voting. Advocating for voting on an article for reasons other than content is strictly against the rules.
 * **Upvoting your own article:** You can upvote or even downvote your article as you like. Keep in mind that this //used// to be against the rules, so you may get negative comments from other users who are working off of outdated information. But it's up to you.

* **Plagiarism**: You may not plagiarize the works of other people. Plagiarism is to copy or borrow heavily from another work and pass it off as your own. Doing so will result in the work being [[[Deletions Guide | summarily deleted]]].
 * **Using images:** Remember, images included in your article **must** follow the rules of our [[[Image Use Policy]]] as well. You must include the source of your images on the discussion page, and this source must be in compliance with our site policy and license. If you have any questions, contact [http://05command.wikidot.com/license-experts-main the licensing team].

* **Forums**: Don't make contentless or excessively short posts (spam), don't bump threads (since bump posts are essentially spam), and don't post on threads more than a few months old if you're not contributing substantially to the conversation. 
 * Edit your previous posts using the "edit" function under the "options" tab to the lower right of every comment.
 * Any images posted to forum or discussion threads must be collapsed (collapsible coding can be found in the "Formatting" tab of [http://www.scp-wiki.net/how-to-write-an-scp this guide]).
 * "Fast Threads" and forum games are not permitted, apart from certain exceptions. Please do not start new forum game threads, as they clog our recent posts page.

* **Donations:** Anyone interested in setting up donation links must read and abide by [http://www.scp-wiki.net/donations-policy the official donations policy].

+++ Editing

* **Responding to Edits of Your Articles**: You may undo edits to your own articles at will. Please do not edit or remove tags added by staff members.

* **Editing Other Articles**: You may make minor edits for grammar or spelling to other peoples' articles. Please fill out the 'Short description of changes' box. Major edits require permission from the original author or staff. Stylistic and tonal edits are considered major edits.

* **Collaborative Logs**: You are free to add content to open collaborative logs. These pages are tagged as "[http://www.scp-wiki.net/system:page-tags/tag/collaboration collaboration]". Poor content will be removed by the page owner or staff. Do not take it upon yourself to fix unauthorized or bad edits to any page.

+++ Interacting With Staff

* **Moderative Posts**: Moderative posts will have a specific title. These titles are used to indicate specific types of posts, and should only be responded to in certain situations. This exact text will be in the post itself:
 * //Call for Rewrite//: Anyone wanting to volunteer to rewrite a page or discuss the rewriting of a page may respond to this post.
 * //Deletion Vote//: Anyone wanting to request a stay of deletion or ask for the opportunity to rewrite may respond to this post. Do not 'vote' unless you are staff.
 * //Stop Order// - Do not respond to this post unless you are staff
 * //Closed// - Do not respond to this post unless you are staff.
 * //Open// - You may respond to this post.

* **Staff Requests**: If a staff member asks you to change something about your behavior, or to temporarily stop making certain kinds of posts, please do so. This may take the form of Staff Posts replying to you in the forums; this means that you have the responsibility of returning to recent conversations (or checking [http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum:recent-posts Recent Forum Posts]) to find out if staff are trying to give you pertinent instructions.

* **Ended Discussions**: If a staff member ends a discussion, it is over. Do not try to get the final word in; just stop.

* **Staff Decisions/Appealing**: Respect Staff decisions, even if you disagree with them. If you feel you are being treated unfairly, please appeal to a different staff member. If the situation is found fair, do not continue to appeal to other staff members in hopes of getting a different response.

**If you feel a user has violated any of the rules on this page, please contact a staff member.**

+++ Banning Policy

The normal policy for punishing offenders breaks down like this:

* Warning
* Membership Revocation
* Short Ban (Usually Weeklong to Monthlong)
* Long Ban (Monthlong to Yearlong)
* Permanent Ban

Before being banned, you will usually be warned to tone down your behavior. If a staff member has to talk to you about your behavior or a mod post is made about your behavior, and you disregard it, then staff will move to the banning phase. 

The most common way to receive a ban is by violating one of the rules mentioned above. Additional violations equal longer bans. An instant permanent ban only results from vandalism, blatant and obvious trolling, harassment of a site member, sockpuppetry, or other severe misconducts.

> __A Quick Side Note__: After banning, you will have to reapply for site membership. If you want to rejoin the community, you should follow the same process as all new members.

> [[size 120%]]Any and all of these rights, obligations, and punishments are subject to alteration, deletion or addition after review by the Staff.[[/size]]
