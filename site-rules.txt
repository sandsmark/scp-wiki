title:Site Rules
**Users:**  As a user, you are entitled to the following rights, and held to the following obligations.

Rights:
# You may comment however you wish on any entry, provided it is done so in the spirit of constructive criticism or conversation, and not as a personal attack or “troll post”.  If you feel a user’s comments are not being posted in the spirit of constructive criticism, please contact a Mod or Admin.
# You may vote however you wish on any entry, provided that this done as an honest expression of opinion on the article and not the author or other outside factors, and not as an attempt to artificially boost/reduce an article’s position as part of a “group strike”.  A “group strike” is defined as the mass voting of an article based on things other than the article’s merit, such as a personal opinion about the author, outside pressure, or other things with no bearing on the entry itself.
# You are allowed to post your entry, provided that this is done in the correct location.
# You may request assistance/comments/review by other users and staff, with the understanding that they are under no obligation to do so, and that the choice is wholly voluntary on their behalf.
# You may question the actions of other users and staff as long as it is done in a calm, mature fashion.
# You may make minor edits for grammar or spelling to other peoples' articles.  Larger edits require permission from the original author or Senior Staff.

Obligations:
# You are to be a mature member of the community.  Heated arguments, vandalism, trolling, and general immaturity, including intentionally writing badly to provoke a reaction, will not be tolerated.
# You are to be open to criticism, and to tolerate the opinion of others whom you may not agree with.  If you feel a commenter is being unnecessarily harsh, please contact a mod.
# Entries may be edited/moved/deleted at any time.  As an original author, you may undo edits if needed, and repost deleted articles upon revision.
# If a mod or admin says a discussion is over, it is over.  If you continue, you are now open to any punishment deemed necessary.
# If you receive multiple comments calling for editing, please do so.  If you choose not to, please state the reason.
# If you constantly have entries deleted, undergo major edits, and be decommissioned, please stop and consult an Admin or Mod before continuing to post new entries.  This will allow us to determine what the issue is, and hopefully keep it from happening any more.
# Respect the Mod and Admin staff decisions.  If you feel you are being treated unfairly, please appeal to a different staff member, and they will review the situation.  If the situation is deemed “fair”, please do not continue to appeal to other staff members in hopes of getting a different response.
# Suggestions for editing by Mods and Admins should be given careful consideration.
# Know who the Admins and Mods are.
# You are not allowed to have a signature for your forum posts.
# You will not post unfinished works on the site proper.

**Nonmoderative Senior Staff**

Rights:

Senior staff are granted the same rights as regular users, but are also allowed to vote the deletion of pages.

Obligations:

# Delete of pages (within guidelines)
# Call for the mass review of a particularly good/bad entry.  Mass Review is defined as the presentation of a entry to garner additional comments or votes, without positive or negative bias.  A entry would be presented as such: “Please read <entry>.  I would like to see what the community opinion of <entry> is.” As opposed to “Read <entry> and tell me how bad it is.”
