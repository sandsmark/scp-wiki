[[include component:image-block name= http://www.scp-wiki.net/local--files/project-morpheus/VR.jpeg |caption=Agent 990-Morpheus utilising SCP-990.]]

**Item #:** SCP-990

**Object Class:** Thaumiel

**Clearance Designation:** O5 personnel. Selected Level 4 or below personnel are cleared under CODE NIDHOGG.

**Universe of Origin:** The Foundation

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-990 is to be kept in the Department of Extra-Universal Affairs Headquarters. Usage of SCP-990 is only allowed with the approval of a majority of the O5 Council. Agent 990-Morpheus is the only approved user of SCP-990.

**Description:** SCP-990 is a device intended to project a user's (designated as 'Agent 990-Morpheus') consciousness into that of another individual (hereon referred to as 'target') during the target's rapid-eye movement (REM) stage of sleep. SCP-990's primary design is derived from the Oneiroi Astral Synchroniser v3.0, a device common to the late Universe 3513-Omega-Purple-Zulu. [[footnote]] Said universe's iteration of Earth was dominated by the conglomerate Oneiroi Gardens, of which astral projection devices were widely used by the populace. In 2045, power failure of the Oneiroi mainframe caused the deaths of 90% of humanity and destabilisation of governments worldwide (equivalent of an IK-class global civilisation collapse scenario). All known similar devices in U 3513-Ω-Purple-Z are believed to have been destroyed. [[/footnote]] 

SCP-990 consists of a modified virtual reality headset with microphone and motion capture gloves attached. These are then attached to a monitor, which processes data retrieved from the target into a series of images. While electrodes are nominally attached to the target's scalp, SCP-990 has been modified such that it can be synchronised with nano-EEG nodes. This allows any individual attached with nano-EEG nodes to be a potential target for SCP-990. Range of effect is speculated to be unlimited throughout multiple universes, a side-effect of the application of the Stem as the setup's power source. [((bibcite 2))] 

In the dreams of the target, Agent 990-Morpheus gains traits characteristic of Class I Oneiric Apparition such as the capacity to manipulate images and sensations experienced by targets. In addition, the user is consistently perceived as a male human of Caucasian descent, regardless of the user's own physical appearance. This allows the true identity of Agent 990-Morpheus to be obscured.

||~ **NANO-ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHIC NODES**||
|| The nano-EEG nodes are designed from state-of-the-art nanotechnology from multiple iterations of the Foundation's R&D, intended as a means to remotely record electrical activity in subjects' brains without their knowledge. They may be injected into a subject's bloodstream, allowing them to enter the brain. The presence of nano-EEG nodes is known to cause minimal interference to the subject. ||

[[collapsible show="• One Foundation personnel to be designated as 'Agent 990-Morpheus'" hide="PERSONNEL FILE ACCESSED"]]

**Personnel Name:** Agent Margaret Nykos  

**Security Clearance Level:** 3/CODE NIDHOGG 

**Position:** Operative, Intelligence Division, Department of Extra-Universal Affairs

**Testimonial:** //For the role of Agent 990-Morpheus, two key aspects must be identified – loyalty and improvisation. The former is required in order to ensure successful delivery of all missions in situations where Agent 990-Morpheus is unable to seek advice from commanders. The latter is necessary when dealing with the noosphere and unpredictable situations there.// 

//Agent Nykos, in my opinion, fulfils the two prerequisites. In her service of the Foundation, her loyalty rating is consistently above average since her employment (in both her home universe and while working for the Multi-U). Given her background in theatrics and track record of on-the-spot thinking, Agent Nykos is entirely capable of maintaining her facade as a Class I pseudo-Oneiric Apparition without exposing her true allegiance with the inner Foundation.// 

//I have also included a few of Agent Nykos' achievements while as an Intelligence Operative.//

* //Successful infiltration of Universe 9375-Beta-Green-Charlie under the alias of a Type Black entity and dissemination of SCP-[[span style="background-color: black; color: black"]]500[[/span]]-[[span style="background-color: black; color: black"]]Ω[[/span]] (CODENAME "Tears of God") to general populace.// 
* //[http://www.scp-wiki.net/how-173-got-to-site-19 Assist in extraction of up to 10 anomalous objects from Foundation Sites in Universe 5643-Gamma-Orange-Delta prior to Procedure 2317-Revelations.]// 
 
//With all of that in mind, it is expected that Nykos will excel in the field as 990-Morpheus.//

[[collapsible show="• Event-990-07" hide="ACCESS APPROVED"]]

**Test Site:** NORAD HQ, United States of America (Universe 8267-Beta-Yellow-Bravo)

**Test Duration:** 6 November 1979 AD – 9 November 1979 AD

**Procedure:** A tape containing a training exercise is to be inserted into NORAD computers, such that it alerts systems of a supposed nuclear attack from a non-existent hostile party. Under fears of a nuclear assault on the USA, it is hypothesised that NORAD will retaliate and the resultant nuclear barrage will destabilise most of Europe, Asia and North America. 

Three days prior, Agent 990-Morpheus will contact Agent ██████ via SCP-990. Aim is to explain in detail in the procedure and its speculated aftermath, in addition to the means to prevent the events leading to a potential K-class scenario. 

**Aftermath:** Test successful. Agent 990-Morpheus is able to contact and converse with Agent ██████ for over 40 hours. After which, Agent ██████ is able to relay instructions relayed to him by Agent 990-Morpheus. Through deployment of that universe's Mobile Task Force Nu-2, the incorrect tape has been removed form NORAD computers. Agent ██████ deceased following Event-990-07. 

Agent 990-Morpheus displays capacity to manipulate images and sensations experienced by Agent ██████, depicting the cities of Moscow, Berlin, Beijing, Seoul, and Istanbul after a nuclear bombardment. 

In addition, Agent 990-Morpheus is recognised as a potential SCP-class object. File entry for "SCP-990" slot opened for Level ≤4 security clearance.

> **Interviewee:** Agent 990-Morpheus 
> 
> **Interviewer:** Dr. Thomas Bailey 
> 
> **Foreword:** The following interview takes place after the events of the interview in Document 990-02. 
> 
> **< Begin Log>**
> 
> **Dr. Bailey:** It appears that Dr. ██████████, whom you have contacted previously, has submitted the interview you had with him. As you'd know, it matches perfectly with our transcript of it.
> 
> **990-Morpheus:** Yes, I believe we have confirmed ██████████'s rumoured photographic memory. But I did not find anything truly anomalous about him.   
> 
> **Dr. Bailey:** So he's cleared for now. But we're here because of you. I will need to enquire about some of your responses.
> 
> **990-Morpheus:** Improvisations, all of them. You gave me this job 'cos of that, in case you forget. 
> 
> **Dr. Bailey:** It's largely for the higher-ups; speaking of which, they are not entirely receptive with you naming yourself, even with pseudonyms. 
> 
> **990-Morpheus:** My identity is still protected. With the avatar, they will expect an old man firstly and not someone like me. Besides, we cannot be traced back.  
> 
> **Dr. Bailey:** True, but the Council wishes you to not reveal anything amounting to personal information. Real or false. The Multi-U's true purpose must not be known to outsiders, you should know that. 
> 
> **990-Morpheus:** Understood sir.
> 
> **Dr. Bailey:** And what of SCP-██████████? 
> 
> **990-Morpheus:** A random number I've improvised. I've checked what I could access in the catalogue. There is no SCP-██████████. 
> 
> **Dr. Bailey:** Yes, there is no SCP-██████████.

++ **Addendum:**

**Addendum PRJMRF-001:** After the IK-class global civilisation collapse scenario in U 3513-Ω-Purple-Z, the term 'Oneiroi Collective" has appeared in up to 100 universes observed by the Multi-U. All witness accounts of the "Oneiroi Collective" occur during witnesses' REM sleep stage, and suggest that they are presently incorporeal and exist in separate plane of reality. [((bibcite 3))] Pending background checks regarding any connections to "Oneiroi Gardens" and registration as a Group of Interest. 

**Addendum PRJMRF-002:** During a deployment of SCP-990, connection with Agent 990-Morpheus was lost for five minutes. During which, the following message appeared on SCP-990.

> To the ladies and gentlemen at the Foundation
> 
> We understand you have been using our products for the greater good. We do not mind the sacrifice of our world and our physical bodies for that sake. After all, we have transcended flesh and become icons of inspiration. 
> 
> Nevertheless, we wish your organisation may credit us in your efforts for the greater good. The recommended course of action is to indicate the source of this modified technology (Oneiroi Astral Synchroniser v3.0). We will reserve the right to withhold further usage if service continues to be uncredited. 
> 
> Sincerely,
> Lawrence Knight 
> Oneiroi Collective Legals 

Agent 990-Morpheus claims to have no encounter with members of the Oneiroi Collective during deployment of SCP-990. Subsequent attempts to use SCP-990 have failed. Project Morpheus is currently under hiatus, and Agent 990-Morpheus is transferred. 

**Addendum PRJMRF-003:** Despite hiatus of Project Morpheus, multiple Foundation operatives have reported sightings of entities similar to Agent 990-Morpheus' avatar in their respective dreams. Pending further investigation. Oneiroi Collective suspected.
