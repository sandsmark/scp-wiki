**Experiment Log of:** Dr. Kondraki, testing practical uses of SCP-295-1

**Date:** █-██-████ to ██-█-████

------

__**Experiment 1:**__ Human consumption testing

**Materials:** 5 ml of SCP-295-1

**Procedure:** Class D personnel given SCP-295-1 to ingest

**Result:** Subject reported mild heartburn and nausea, but no serious adverse effects observed. Subject’s digestive system temporarily operated at 25% additional efficiency.

------

__**Experiment 2:**__ Usage as a portable source of light.

**Materials:** 20 ml of SCP-295-1, glass tubing, rubber grip, lighter.

**Procedure:** Glass tubing filled with SCP-295-1, reinforced by rubber grip.

**Result:** Device produced sufficient light to completely illuminate an area of 100 ft^^2^^ at 16145 lx for several hours. Applying a lighter to the surface of the glass relit the solution completely.

------

__**Experiment 3:**__ Usage as an incendiary device

**Materials:** 200 ml of SCP-295-1, glass globe.

**Procedure:** Globe filled with SCP-295-1 and thrown into wooden test structure. 	

**Result:** All material that came in contact with SCP-295-1 instantly combusted as expected. Remaining structure of the building burned abnormally quickly from secondary conflagration. Only 20% of  the structure’s initial mass remained after testing.

//Note: After reading over the test logs, approximately 56% of SCP-295 specimens began to pupate immediately at the conclusion of the test.// - Dr. Kondraki

------

__**Experiment 4:**__ Usage as lighter fluid

**Materials:** 100 ml of SCP-295-1, 1 bag of consumer grade charcoal, mid-range coal grill, 2 beef burger patties

**Procedure:** SCP-295-1 poured onto coal, while beef patties are prepared.

**Result:** **[DATA EXPUNGED]**

//Note: I cannot fathom the lack of sense this required. Consider your position as an assistant terminated, and your security level revoked. I hope that gives you something to think about in-between skin grafts.// - Dr. Kondraki
