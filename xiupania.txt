     齐勺所有存在的集体, sometimes called Xiupania, abbreviated XP, and in short often known informally as Xiupan, is a collective consciousness originated from one ##purple|**Qi Shao**## and currently based in one Jason Graham. Jason Graham is the capitol. Xiu Pan is the largest city. 

     Xiu Pan and all other states of Xiupania are derivative states of ##purple|**Jason Graham**##, each in essence identical to the capitol Jason Graham. Roughly 60 derivative Xiupanian states are known to exist across 60 different hosts. Xiupanian states are 1,212 mi² in area and adhere to a continuum, looping into themselves. The geography of a Xiupanian state consists of a floating, temperate archipelago. Day and night cycles are largely erratic, and depend on government discretion. There is no light source in the Xiupania, but a ##purple|**terran**## approximation of a starlit sky that increases in brightness depending on time of day. This archipelago floats and rests over and under 35m of void space.

     Xiupania is a ##purple|**concrete low fantasy**##.  An individual’s powers within Xiupania are semi-mundane. The modifying of one's physical appearance, object creation, and mobility are inhibited. Corporeal entities require government authorization to wake, and are often treated as indentured servants or second-class citizens.

     Xiupania maintains low literacy, life expectancy, education levels and is one of the least visited nations. The origin state of Qi Shao is grounded in a mentally unstable host and as such causes new Xiupanian hosts to experience similar problems. ##purple|**Nightmares**## and ##purple|**Terrors**## frequently plague Xiupania, and in some extreme cases Xiupanian states have caused the death of their hosts due to infighting and violence occurring during parasomnic events. Difficulties in the capitol are irritated even further due to the fact that the nation’s host is aware of its presence, and frequently attempts to conquer the region during lucid dreams.

     Emperor Qi Shao, while corporeal, was suffering from brain cancer, and during the end of her life was researching the Oneroi joining technique. Although denied by Qi Shao, the act of inhabiting Jason Graham is considered an act of desperation. Not much else is known about Qi Shao, as shortly after initial contact with Oneroi West, access to Xiupania was restricted. Oneroi-West beings attempting to access Xiupania are met with lethal force. While capitol punishment is illegal in Xiupania, corporeal criminals and invalids are often deported without properly separating from their hosts, causing their host subconscious to emulate Xiupanian states and thus propagating their spread.

   I have taken tea with the Grand Emperor Qi Shao, and she is truly a sight to behold; massive golden wings the size of a small cottage, rows upon rows of curved teeth, and black pitted eyes in which rest the tiny diamonds that are her pupils. Her tendrils lazily flop about the table during my interview with her, and she seems disinterested while she recounts the history of Xiupania.

//Yes, my kingdom is small by the standards of the Oneroi, as I have but only 60 hosts. This is a small network, not like the sprawling, globe-spanning nodes of the Oneroi Collective, or the incoherent brooks and streams that are Oneroi West. No, I have but very little territory, but within my territory is a population rivaling all of oneroikind,//

Her remarks are bold, but empty. She recounts the atrocities that take place in her nation while the silvery white needle of her tongue descends to siphon her tea.

//Just yesterday, I may have created five additional states. I found corporeals wandering around the marble terraces of the southern archipelago - relayed to me by one of my subjects. They were doing a bit of sightseeing. My kingdom -Jason- is very handsome, you see. I was not warned of this ‘tourism’, nor do I allow it, so, I went to them.//

The many rows of Qi Shao’s teeth began to rotate in spirals - from her lips to deep within her throat - as she describes their punishment to me.

//It is only a dream. I cannot be bothered with this. What real crime am I committing on corporeals? People wake up, and they live their lives. So what if they’re part of my network? People do not want their subconscious - their shadows. People do not want to accept who they truly are.// 

//...But I know what you are going to ask me: What about beings without bodies to return to? Am I not killing them? Surely, I am ending their lives? Of course.//

++++++ WORLD NEWS

+ OW Dignitary Arrested In Xiupania, Accused Of Tourist Acts
++ The secretive collective said it had detained an Oneroi West official identified as ambassador Deathbell “Bob” Fever.
[[size 1.2em]]
Xiupania, Qi Shao, has detained an OW dignitary, accusing them of attempting to “enjoy Xiupania without express permissions”, Qi Shao reported Friday morning.

The entity was identified by Qi Shao as the OW ambassador Deathbell “Bob” Fever, and was said to have been “arrested while disrespecting Jason Graham (the Nation of Xiupania’s original host subconscious).”

Qi Shao said Deathbell had entered their capitol “under the guise” of foreign relations with the intent of “gathering information and undermining the integrity of the XIupan collective,” and was operating “under the connivance” of the Oneiroi Collective. Although Qi Shao claims Deathbell denied this, and stated his loyalty was with only Oneroi West.

The Oneroi Collective tweeted a series of algorithms and audio files that were later interpreted to state that they were in no way involved with Oneiroi West activity in Xiupania. Shortly afterward it hooted the following:

I am sick and tired of OW people going to Xiupania and then being detained on some charge then the OW or OC is supposed to do something to get them out.
Did these people not know what happens in XP?

From my point of view if you go to XP then you are on your own.

Okay, first of all, Gore is a racist idiot. 

What we need to do is kill Jason Graham, preferably with Qi Shao in him. Come on, how hard is it? they only have a network of 60 bodies. And, as of the last report, they’re really far apart from one another so it’s not like Qi is doing a lot of moving around. Hell, I can get Jason Graham’s address if I really cared enough! Beside’s, Jason KNOWS Qi is in him and he knows about Oneroi, if he really wanted it to stop he’d just leave his body or kill Qi Shao himself.

An unknown, singular multitude is squeezing its way into Burns, where OW and XP have been in a dominance standoff for 170 years. While it seems Xiupania has the upper hand, with OW struggling to maintain its perch amidst the endless swarms, the alien presence coalesces over them. 
##gray|,,/o/rottensushi,,##

##gray|5 hour(s) ago##
The gentle, seafoam sky of Burns is buzzing with Xiupanian death cries as the abstract wave washes over them. The native population of gummy cloud turtles and marshmallow whales are consumed instantly with the arrival of the abstract.
##gray|,,/o/rottensushi,,##

##gray|5 hour(s) ago##
Oneroi West begins to withdraw from the area. Ethologics are instructed to remain on the front lines to identify the abstract. Xiupanian drones are seen cutting into the abstract multitude, all the while piercing through the retreating stare of OW.

##gray|5 hour(s) ago##
Abstract is "unknowable". Speculations that it is the Oneroi Collective. An intrusion of OC into OW or XP territories would be unprecedented.

##gray|4 hour(s) ago##
Xiupanians do not seem to be retreating. The majority of OW save for ethologics have vacated the area.  Xiupanian death counts are estimated to be in the thousands, but few have died.

##gray|4 hour(s) ago##
> This is why we can't //really// fight Xiupania. There is no imagination in Xiupania, they're drones. They can fight the abstracts because they do not even recognize it as such. We see the Collective and we lose our minds. They don't have "eyes".
##gray|,,/o/pestilence,,##

##gray|4 hour(s) ago##
The abstract continues to flood in. An exploratory mission is underway to learn where the abstract is coming from for the postmortem. A group of unidentified corporeal Shadows are seen retreating on the opposite end of the abstract floodmouth.

##gray|3 hour(s) ago##
Billy Burns went to sleep next to someone we're not aware of. A structuralist has gathered that the encounter took place in a motel and was purely sexual in nature. The unknown partner was a carrier, not knowledgeable of Oneroi. Although he didn't use protection, he didn't contract any STIs. Sadly, this will matter little after the battle is over as the region will be surely uninhabitable by anything but Xiupanians.

Abstract is no longer flooding in. Possible there is none left, or the invading host has left relay proximity. Abstract begins to take shape as the Xiupanians cut down the remainder.

##gray|2 hour(s) ago##
Abstract confirmed to be Oneroi Collective - //Singular// Oneroi entities begin to take shape as they separate from the abstract:

> There are human forms and concepts, but mostly confused human shapes. They're appearing as they're split in two by the XP reapers. I cannot calibrate with them... I can, but it is disgusting, painful. These are tortured people, to join with them would be to infect my mind.

> Some of them fight: One-Thousand Skulls appeared suddenly from its abstract shell. The Xiupanians... Maybe they do not know fear.

>The eyes of the reborn construct flooded with white, and a black mist reached out over the shattered void above. When it hit the Xiupanians, they shrank into nothing.

Massive belts of dead Xiupanians form an orbit around One-Thousand Skulls. Xiupanian drones continue to assault the entity.

An empath relays the following:

> Many sisters make their sacrifice for me. Their corpses gently caress my carapace as I move toward the towering victim. It is one-thousand miles tall, one-thousand Oneroi strong, and their skulls all cry out for death as I draw near to them. They vomit their black smoke and sing in warped voices as sisters to my left and right shrink. 
> 
> The sky is full of dying sisters, and their gray blood. All of the blue and green is gone now - the void is all white. This provides me functional, clear contrast. I hurdle into the mouth of a crying skull, my four arms and their four nails slice the target in a toppled cross. My mission is complete, this skull is done protesting. Satisfied, I die quietly with my prey, and my sisters follow behind me.

##purple|You'll be awake soon, corporeal. You will not join with me again for taking knowledge of Qi Shao or sad Xiupania, not with your intentions. ##

##purple|I will scoop Xiupania up. They will suffer long like all Oneroi do, and wake up, because you slept in again, cutey! ##

##purple|They will suffer bravely! Don't make me throw the water bucket on you. You won't remember any of this, because I made waffles, silly. ##

##purple|Mark my words, honey: //I made bacon too.//##
