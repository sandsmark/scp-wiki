Alright that's enough of that. Here are some **SCPs** I wrote:

> Hurts to talk. Please. Hard to tal‚Äî //(video ends)//

A story about the difficulty of empathizing through a veil.

I talked about this one with [[*user TheeSherm]] on the Site-42 livestream; you can watch the recording on YouTube [[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKx7TORJIOM|here]]].

> A one-page reference guide, detailing previously used books and SCP-4368's apparent literature preferences, is available at the Site-64 library's front desk.

An ironic tragedy onion and a //Twilight Zone// homage. This started way goofier than it ended up when published, much for the better.

> She laughs a moment later, but the crumbling remains in your mind to this day, deep in the pit of your coward's stomach. This is you.

A meditation on identity and vicarious experience.

Now, here are some **favorite SCPs** of mine (that I didn't write):

[[tab SCP-4182]]
[[size 1.5em]][[[scp-4182|There is no Site-5]]].[[/size]]
[[module ListPages name="SCP-4182" order="rating" limit="5" separate="no"]]

A total mindfuck, but with a solemn and focused purpose. The sort of horror that makes you nauseated by the actual world. And despite being several years removed from the world of Marble Hornets and "video with visual distortion is //a priori// spooky", damn, that ending gets me.
[[/tab]]

[[tab SCP-4183]]
[[size 1.5em]][[[scp-4183|Automatic Containment Procedures]]].[[/size]]
[[module ListPages name="SCP-4183" order="rating" limit="5" separate="no"]]
%%title_linked%%, by %%created_by%% on %%created_at%%; ##green|**+%%rating%%**## (%%comments%% comments)
[[/module]]

A wonderful character study of some things you wouldn't ordinarily identify as "characters." Earns every bit of its narrative carefully and thoughtfully, peeling back the ordinary SCP format and telling an entirely different kind of story within it.
[[/tab]]

[[tab SCP-4508]]
[[size 1.5em]][[[scp-4183|Otterly Prophetic]]].[[/size]]
[[module ListPages name="SCP-4508" order="rating" limit="5" separate="no"]]

I grow increasingly weary and skeptical of absurdist SCPs by the day, but this one is a great example of how to balance and deliver storytelling in a way that never goes too far over the top, that keeps you just that right amount of unnerved even as the core concept remains a bit goofy. The handling of the text messages is perfect here, leading to a lean, propulsive bit of core narrative.
[[/tab]]

[[tab SCP-4517]]
[[size 1.5em]][[[scp-4517|Not Very ùí©]]].[[/size]]
[[module ListPages name="SCP-4517" order="rating" limit="5" separate="no"]]

Such a perfect bit of redacting that it reveals just how facile and effectless 99% of the redaction is anywhere else on the wiki. The storytelling itself is sort of majestic in conveying so much affect without ever once cheating on the clinical tone and structure.

[[tab SCP-3001]]
[[size 1.5em]][[[scp-3001|Red Reality]]].[[/size]]
[[module ListPages name="SCP-3001" order="rating" limit="5" separate="no"]]

Not sure I need to explain too much about this one; it's a masterpiece of characterization and horror.

This was really the SCP that got me formally "into" the website; though I'd read SCPs prior to this one, I re-found the website through a link to 3008 on the website MetaFilter. That was just a couple of years ago; I'd pop back in every now and then to read from that point, until late 2019 when I finally decided to see about the folks who write this crazy shit.
