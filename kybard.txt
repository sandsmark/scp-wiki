//Hurts to talk. Please. Hard to talâ€” (video ends)//

A story about the difficulty of empathizing through a veil.

I talked about this one with [[*user TheeSherm]] on the Site-42 livestream; you can watch the recording on YouTube [[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKx7TORJIOM|here]]].

//A one-page reference guide, detailing previously used books and SCP-4368's apparent literature preferences, is available at the Site-64 library's front desk.//

An ironic tragedy onion and a //Twilight Zone// homage. This started way goofier than it ended up when published, much for the better.

//She laughs a moment later, but the crumbling remains in your mind to this day, deep in the pit of your coward's stomach. This is you.//

A meditation on identity and vicarious experience.
