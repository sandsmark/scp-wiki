**Item #:** SCP-4060

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4060 is currently contained in a dual lock safe in Unit 10 of Site 76. The keys to SCP-4060's safe are to be assigned to two non-associated personnel with at least Level 3 Clearance. Personnel assigned to the SCP-4060 must undergo psychological evaluations and debriefings every month and after each onsite containment breach. 

Any onsite personnel shown to have sympathies towards any groups of interest on the Notable Groups of Interest List should be reported to Site Director Dr. Matthews.

**Description:** SCP-4060 is a small black two-pan beam balance scale. SCP-4060 is able to trade memories between subjects or between an individual and itself. SCP-4060 is known to obtain and store any memory that an individual has lost due to an amnestic, as well any a subject loses due to SCP-4060's anomalous properties. SCP-4060's anomalous properties activate after a subject knowingly places an object on either side of the scale and once both sides of the scale are left undisturbed for approximately 30 seconds.

During the exchange, the objects on the side of the scale a subject had last placed an object on, are the influencing parameters for the memories the subject will lose. The same factors on the opposite side of the scale similarly influence the memories the subject will acquire.

Memories gained are from another individual whose "last placed object" is on the other side of the scale or from SCP-4060 itself.

Memories lost are acquired by another individual whose "last placed object" is on the other side of the scale or by SCP-4060 itself.
----
**11/15/2005 - Notice from Dr. Matthews:** As a reminder, neither side of SCP-4060 is the dedicated loss or gain side. It is instead based on the most recent side of SCP-4060 that an individual placed an object on that dictates which side is the loss or gain for that individual.
----

The following are the current hypothetical effects of the parameters for the exchanges caused by SCP-4060:

* Mass - Sum of the mass on a side of the scale correlates to the length of the memory exchanged.

* Quantity - The total quantity of objects on a side of the scale correlates to the age of the memories SCP-4060 can exchange.

* Personal Value - When a subject places an object on the scale, that subjects sentimental or perceived value of the object correlates to the subjective importance/weight of memories exchanged. 

* Strong Personal Symbolism - Should an object that a subject places onto the scale have any strong personally held connotations for that subject, it will cause some of the exchanged memories content to correlate to that connotation.

SCP-4060 was recovered on 07/15/2005 by Mobile Task Force Delta-5 from Area ██, Sector ██, after ██ simultaneous containment breaches had compromised the functionality of the facility. Only a single handwritten letter regarding SCP-4060 was found in the remains of Sector ██.

> Dr. ██████, who had been showing more and more overt sympathy towards ███ ██████, had been found to have leaked that SCP-4060 had granted memories related to SCP-████ in a previous test.

**07/15/2008 - Notice from Site Director Dr. Matthews:** It is also worth reiterating that any memory lost via an amnestic, by any individual ever, SCP-4060 has stored in it. Thus, a subject that uses SCP-4060's can acquire any such memory. As acquired memories are unaffected by amnestics, in order to make sure memory of catastrophic sensitivity is not acquired by unauthorized personnel, only Class D personnel are permitted to interact with SCP-4060 and thereafter must have all of their communication closely monitored for one month by a team with at least Level 3 clearance.

__**Test 11/15/2005**__
> **Test Overseen by Researcher Dr. Matthews.**
> **Subjects:** D-1753, male, age twenty-two, and D-2120, female, age twenty-seven.
> **Procedure:** Subject D-1753 places two 1 gram weights on the left side of the scale and then one 1 gram weight on the right side of the scale.
> Subject D-2120 places six 1 gram weights on the right side of the scale and then a 1 gram weight on the left side of the scale.
> **Results:** Subject D-1753 cries out the name of his girlfriend, who he claims had not visited him while he was incarcerated three years ago, visitor logs state otherwise.
> Subject D-1753 then began mimicking going through labor before looking down into his arms and crying. Subject claims to have remembered giving birth and crying tears of joy to see his child seven years ago. 
> Subject D-2120 mimics going through labor before looking down into her arms and crying. 
> Subject D-2120 then cries out the name of her girlfriend, who she claims had visited her while she was incarcerated at ████████ three years ago, Subject D-2120 has never been to ████████.
> **Analysis:** Participants seem to have had one last recollection of the memory about to be lost and a vivid reliving of a new memory as it is gained. 

__**Test 12/15/2005**__
> **Test Overseen by Researcher Dr. Matthews.**
> **Subjects:** D-2310, female, age forty-one.
> **Procedure:** Subject D-2310 places seven 1 Kg weights on the left side of the scale and then places a 1 gram weight on the left side.
> **Results:** Subject D-2310 begins screaming and convulsing violently. 
> **Analysis:** After reviewing by several psychologists and hypnosis specialists, examination records are found to match those from the failed trials of 102-04-0576 [[footnote]] Failed iteration of Class F amnestic. [[/footnote]]. Concluded that any attempts to create an exchange with more memory gained than lost may lead to irreparable damage to those involved in the exchange. 

__**Test 07/15/2006**__
> **Test Overseen by Senior Researcher Dr. Matthews.**
> **Subject:** D-1766, male, age twenty-seven, who had a week previously been asked to solve a Rubik's cube in return for a 6 pack of [REDACTED].
> **Procedure:** Subject places one unsolved Rubik's cube on the left side of the scale and then one dog collar on the right side of the scale.
> **Results:** Subject forgets having terminated a dog during a breaking and entering he committed 01/13/2005. 
> The subject afterward has the experience to be able to solve the Rubik's cube puzzle, that they had previously been unable to solve.
> **Analysis:** Memories selected seem to have a correlation to the personal connotations the subject may have to items they have placed on either side of the scale. 

__**Test 8/15/2006**__
> **Test Overseen by Senior Researcher Dr. Matthews.**
> **Subjects:** Subject D-4389, male, age eighty-four, diagnosed with dementia.
> **Procedure:** Subject D-4389 places a photo of four security team personnel on the left side of the scale and then a 1 gram weight on the right side of the scale.
> **Results:** Subject D-4389 is able to name three of the four security officers by name as well as retain this information after 10 months.
> **Analysis:** The memories granted by SCP-4060 seem to be immune to the effects of memory degradation.

__**Test 06/15/2007**__
> **Test Overseen by Senior Researcher Dr. Matthews.**
> **Subject:** D-1766, male, age twenty-seven.
> **Procedure:** Subject places a 1 gram weight on the left side of the scale and then a 22 karat ingot of gold on the right side of the scale.
> **Results:** Subject began inquiring about information related to SCP-1883.
> ----------
> -**Interview following results of Test 3**-
> **Interviewed:** [D-1766]
> **Interviewer:** [Dr. Matthews]
> **Foreword:** Subject D-1766 been used to test SCP-1883, after getting the high score by [Redacted] the other participants. The following was an attempt to verify if the subject's memory of SCP-1883 was new information, or if SCP-4060 had negated the Amnestic administered to Subject D-1766. 
> **<Begin Log>**
> **Dr. Matthews:** How do you know about SCP-1883?
> **D-1766:** Lady, you better not have ruined my high score!
> **Dr. Matthews:** What are you talking about?
> **D-1766:** I had 1150 points!
> **Dr. Matthews:** Please answer the question.
> **D-1766:** <Subject get up in an attempt to find a method to interact with SCP-1883>
> **Dr. Matthews:** <Calls for Security Personnel>
> **<End Log>**
> **Closing Statement:** Sedatives and Amnestics were again given to Subject D-1766, who later awoke and continued complaining in regards to SCP-1883. Subject later found to have lost all memory how to solve a Rubik's cube.
> ----------
> **Analysis:** Memories which are gained are unaffected by amnestics. It is still unknown if the use of amnestics is another method by which SCP-4060 gathers memories or if it is simply undoing their effects. 

__**Test 07/15/2007**__
