title:SCP-3579
**Item #:** SCP-3579
 
**Object Class:** Euclid
 
**Special Containment Procedures:** Any physical instances of SCP-3579-1 are to be taken down by undercover Foundation personnel, disguised as working men. Any website hosting digital instances of SCP-3579-1 are to be remotely changed as to not feature SCP-3579-1. All calls to SCP-3579 are to be traced and ended if possible. Research of SCP-3579 is only to be conducted by Level 2 staff using a cell phone with the phone number of SCP-3579 on speed-dial, kept in storeroom 24 of Site-15. 
 
**Description:** SCP-3579 is a telephone operated service running under the name “Insta-Gator,” using the telephone number 1-800-███-████. Occasionally, advertisements featuring SCP-3579 and its number will appear in major cities as well as websites, known as SCP-3579-1. Instances of SCP-3579-1 will feature the phone number associated with SCP-3579 and the tag line: "//Need some help with a troublemaker? Wish you could just eliminate 'er? We'll be your problem solving crusader. Just call us at Insta-Gator!//" Clicking on a digital instance of SCP-3579-1 displayed on a website will lead you to https://www.████████████.com/insta-gator, but will display a 404 page.

When called, a pre-recorded voice asks the caller to name a destination. When a valid destination is spoken into the phone, the caller is asked if they would like to proceed by pressing ‘1’ on the phone or save the destination by pressing ‘2’ or to cancel by pressing the pound key.

If the caller presses ‘1’ to proceed, the pre-recorded message asks them to press a number on their phone to select the ‘amount they would like’, or press pound to cancel. When a number from one through nine is pressed, a corresponding amount of fully grown, live American alligators (//Alligator mississippiensis//), identified as SCP-3579-2 will enter the specified area through any body of water within 10 m of identified location. If no water is near, a small puddle which expands to accommodate the amount requested on the phone call with SCP-3579. Instances of SCP-3579-2 are almost always hostile upon arrival to the designated location and only leave the body of water to attack, but will never attack the individual who made the call. After 10 minutes, every instance of SCP-3579-2 will attempt to return to the body of water, into which they will dematerialize. If the body of water was created by SCP-3579, it will dissipate into water vapour.

If the caller presses '2' to save the destination, the pre-recorded voice will ask if they wish to continue and call SCP-3579-2 to the area by pressing '1' or end the call by pressing the pound key. When the number is dialed again by the same caller, an additional option will be asked before asking which saved location the caller would like by pressing a number key, keeping up to nine saved locations, or the star key to input a new location, or the pound key to quit the call.

Instances of SCP-3579-2 display various anomalies compared to regular American alligators. Instances of SCP-3579-2 are always male, exactly 4 metres long, and visually exact to any other instance of SCP-3579-2. If kept outside of a body of water for more that 5 minutes, instances of SCP-3579-2 will die. Recent scans of the DNA of multiple instances of SCP-3579-2 concluded that each instance has identical genetic makeup.

The location that SCP-3579 operates from is currently unknown.

**Test Log:**
> **Test 3579-01**
> **Location chosen:** ███████ Wetlands, Louisiana
> **Amount requested:** Six
> **Objects present:** None
> **Result:** Six instances of SCP-3579-2 violently thrashed out of the water in a tight circle and constantly leaped and attacked the air above them for ten minutes before returning to the water.

> **Test 3579-02**
> **Location chosen:** Pond within Biological Research Site-104
> **Amount requested:** Two
> **Objects present:** Two Class-D personnel. D-3579-01 standing next to the pond, and D-3579-02 standing 15 metres away.
> **Result:** Two instances of SCP-3579-2 crawled out of the pond. The first immediately attacked D-3579-01, while the second chased down D-3579-02 and attacked. Both instances of SCP-3579-2 killed their respective Class-D personnel and returned to the pond after ten minutes.
> **Researcher's Note:** //Well, that was... gruesome. Remind me to keep that number secure. Ick. -Dr. L█████//

> **Test 3579-03**
> **Location chosen:** 'Beside me' (Within a research laboratory in Site-15)
> **Amount requested:** One
> **Objects present:** A live pig.
> **Result:** A small puddle formed on the floor of the lab beside Dr. L█████. Despite the puddle not being deep at all, an instance of SCP-3579-2 emerged from it, with its body half submerged as it thrashed. It did not attempt to eat the pig.
> **Researcher's Note:** //Seems these things only hunt people. Is this number supposed to be an overkill hitman service? -Dr. L█████//

> **Test 3579-04**
> **Location chosen:** A bowl of water within a two-roomed research laboratory in Site-15
> **Amount requested:** Three
> **Objects present:** Three Class-D personnel. D-3579-03 and -04 are to stand near the doorway between the two rooms, and D-3579-05 is to stand at the opposite end of the other room.
> **Result:** Three instances of SCP-3579-2 dove from the bowl, two of which attacked the Class-D personnel standing near the doorway and later returned into the bowl. The third instance traversed to D-3579-05 and attacked them. The doorway was locked down while the instance of SCP-3579-2 was in the room without the bowl. After five minutes of being trapped, the instance of SCP-3579-2 seemed to suffer a heart attack and died.

> **Test 3579-05**
> **Location chosen:** Within a research laboratory in Site-15
> **Amount requested:** One
> **Objects present:** A clipboard with a research notes page, [[[SCP-1161]]], both placed on the ground
> **Result:** A sink within the lab turned itself on, filling with water. A single instance of SCP-3579-2 climbed out, and calmly crawled towards the clipboard and SCP-1161. After being hunched over the clipboard for about 4 minutes, the instance of SCP-3579-2 climbed back into the sink. The clipboard was filled out, in scrawny handwriting.

> **Location chosen:** Surface of Lunar Area-23
> **Amount requested:** One
> **Objects present:** None
> **Result:** A small puddle of liquid water formed on the lunar surface, and one instance of SCP-3579-2 leaped from it, immediately suffocating due to the vacuum of space. The puddle dissipated without SCP-3579-2 returning to it.
> **Researcher's Note:** //Who's idea was this? -Dr. L█████//
