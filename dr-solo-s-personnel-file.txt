**Name:** Doctor Edwin Solo

**Security Clearance:** 3.5

**Duties:** TBD

**Location:** Site-19

**Profile:** Unanimously described as “resoundingly average” and “sufficient, I suppose”, Doctor Ed Solo has had a medium-length and not particularly interesting career with The Foundation. Doctor Solo just barely meets the necessary criteria for Foundation employment, and has been the recipient of no accolades, honors, or awards. 

Long serving as a Junior Researcher, Ed was promoted to the position of Intermediate Researcher after Administration deemed him to be “better than junior, I guess, but does he really deserve the SR position?”. To date, he remains the only Foundation employee to be given this title.

After being hired, Dr. Solo was never officially assigned to any department, and so he currently drifts from team to team, doing standard work and impressing no one. His remarkable aptitude for lackluster but acceptable work has resulted in a track record completely devoid of containment breaches, commendations, fatal accidents, successful re-containments, breakthroughs, or any notable discoveries, infractions, merits, demerits, or otherwise differentiating events.
