**Name:** Doctor Edwin Solo

**Security Clearance:** 3.5

**Duties:** TBD

**Location:** Site-19

**Profile:** Unanimously described as “resoundingly average” and “sufficient, I suppose”, Doctor Ed Solo has had a medium-length and not particularly interesting career with The Foundation. Doctor Solo just barely meets the necessary criteria for Foundation employment, and has been the recipient of no accolades, honors, or awards. 

Long serving as a Junior Researcher, Ed was promoted to the position of Intermediate Researcher after Administration deemed him to be “better than junior, I guess, but does he really deserve the SR position?”. To date, he remains the only Foundation employee to be given this title.

After being hired, Dr. Solo was never officially assigned to any department, and so he currently drifts from team to team, doing standard work and impressing no one. His remarkable aptitude for lackluster but acceptable work has resulted in a track record completely devoid of containment breaches, commendations, fatal accidents, successful re-containments, breakthroughs, or any notable discoveries, infractions, merits, demerits, or otherwise differentiating events.

[[tab Peer Review]]
This is eventually going to become my commentary page

+ The Skeleton Gallery
"//It works for quite a few people here (as evidenced by this being in the positives), but I can't say it works for me.//"

+ Mud Man
"//For me, it reads like an abridged version of a more engrossing tale.//"

+ Parasitic Mayonnaise Worms
"//I like the screwy label, but that final worm that just dies still seems like a total letdown to me. No vote.//"

+ Womb Farm
"//So… is this a boogey-man/evil version of Tom Bombadil? Not really doing it for me.//"

+ Emperor's Debt
"//This forces me to compare which looks better to express their respective story. And I will have to admit that MC&D pulled it off better.//"

+ Bones of Contention
"//Spooky, but the skeleton liberation front by itself isn't enough to carry the article.//"

+ Dionysus
"//I'm reading an SCP, so yes reading about sentient yeast is perfectly plausible and acceptable. However an SCP that claims that the alcohol produced is non-anomalous and then in the same breath claims that it has anomalous affect which are completely unexplained or even an "huh, that's weird since we just said it was non-anomalous….". It's the continuity break that pulls me out of my suspension of disbelief. So imo its really more trying to fish out the camel so I can drink the gnat.//"

+ //Tragedy of SCP-2763//
"//While format screws can be interesting, I feel like this one in particular has been done before quite a bit and in better presentation - not in this exact method, but in the form of changing the written details while keeping to a similar medium and even telling.

On top of that, the idea itself isn't terribly interesting, and to be honest has kinda been done before.

Ultimately, as well, there's not much else to it… I think if you ever do a rewrite or make something similar, you should hold onto some of the ideas here (things like the tone and speaking/writing manner of the Scip), but change the presentation and add some stakes.//"

+ D-Class, Sarkicist, Yithian
"//Why'd it have to be Sarkicism? Why couldn't the beings from beyond exist on their own? Why does everyone feel like their body horror SCP isn't complete unless it references some Karcist or Klavigar or Koka-kola with several K's in the name?//"

+ Gashadokuro
"//While a bunch of giant skeletons certainly invite the goofy Andrew Gold references, the Nanking Massacre and the atomic bombing of two Japanese cities do not. There's a lot to love here, but you're going to have to pick one of these tones before I feel comfortable upvoting this.//"

+ Hot Potato
"//Article based on a frankly dumb title joke, AWCY? once again serving the role of terrorist organization that's associated with art for some reason, a bunch of GoIs that all somehow manage to keep their activities secret while killing each other, and an ending featuring a thing with a note taped to it. There is absolutely no way I can not downvote this.//"

+ Narcotic Crustaceans
"//I have half a feeling that this is the kind of article where I may reassess in time, but downvoted for now.//"

+ Higher Power
"//Ehh…the recordings came across as slightly hammy, and this skip just doesn't seem completely fleshed out. Neutral vote for now.//"
