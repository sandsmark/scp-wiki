title:Expert Witnesses
So there's been some talk here and there for quite a while about establishing a list of people with specific knowledge bases who'd be willing to act as advisors/consultants on certain specialty topics. Many view this as a good idea and there are apparently people willing to volunteer for this, so here we are: a list of experts in various fields.

Note that this is a list of //**volunteer**// experts. Don't add anyone to this list besides yourself, and be polite and courteous to these volunteers. They don't have to help you and are providing their services out of the goodness of their hearts.

Given that any given person on this list might be proficient in more than one field, it is NOT organized by field, but rather by username. If you add yourself, use the following format, and add yourself **alphabetically**.
[[code]]
: [[*user username]] : fields of expertise
[[/code]]
Note that the following rule is now ironclad, after some unintentional silliness when this page was first posted:

> ++ ##red|**PLEASE DO NOT PUT YOURSELF ON THIS LIST UNLESS YOU FULFILL THE FOLLOWING REQUIREMENTS:**##
> * **You must have either a degree, significant professional experience (meaning at least several years), or have in-depth academic knowledge in the field.** If you are merely a hobbyist or have some passing interest in a subject, you should not consider yourself a subject matter expert.
> * **You must be regularly available via forums and/or IRC.** If people can't easily get ahold of you, then that doesn't really help. If your IRC nickname is different from your site name, please list that as well.
> * **You must be willing to help others with your subject matter expertise.** This isn't a bragging contest or talent show, this is an effort to get people in contact with experts who can help them with technical details.
> * **Please defer to active contributors.** Even if you are a valid subject matter expert, knowing how to apply that knowledge to writing for the SCP community is critical in separating actually interesting information from unnecessary fluff. If you have not successfully contributed to the SCP Wiki in the form of SCP articles, tales, or other non-collaborative literature, then please defer to those who have.

If you want to make yourself available for reference on stuff you're a hobbyist at, feel free to list that //in the comments on the thread named [http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-469950/expert-witnesses#post-1455710 "Non-profession Helpers"]//.
