title:Expert Witnesses
parent:guide-hub
So there's been some talk here and there for quite a while about establishing a list of people with specific knowledge bases who'd be willing to act as advisors/consultants on certain specialty topics. Many view this as a good idea and there are apparently people willing to volunteer for this, so here we are: a list of experts in various fields.

Note that this is a list of //**volunteer**// experts. Don't add anyone to this list besides yourself, and be polite and courteous to these volunteers. They don't have to help you and are providing their services out of the goodness of their hearts.

Given that any given person on this list might be proficient in more than one field, it is NOT organized by field, but rather by username. If you add yourself, use the following format, and add yourself alphabetically.
[[code]]
: [[*user username]] : fields of expertise
[[/code]]
Note that the following rule is now ironclad, after same unintentional silliness when this page was first posted:

//**DO NOT PUT YOURSELF ON THE LIST UNLESS YOU HAVE A DEGREE IN THE FIELD, SIGNIFICANT WORK EXPERIENCE IN THE FIELD OR DETAILED HISTORICAL KNOWLEDGE**//

If you want to make yourself available for reference on stuff you're a hobbyist at, feel free to list that //in the comments on the thread named "Non-profession Helpers"//.
