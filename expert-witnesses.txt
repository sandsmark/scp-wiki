title:Expert Witnesses
parent:guide-hub
So there's been some talk here and there for quite a while about establishing a list of people with specific knowledge bases who'd be willing to act as advisors/consultants on certain specialty topics. Many view this as a good idea and there are apparently people willing to volunteer for this, so here we are: a list of experts in various fields.

Note that this is a list of //**volunteer**// experts. Don't add anyone to this list besides yourself, and be polite and courteous to these volunteers. They don't have to help you and are providing their services out of the goodness of their hearts.

Given that any given person on this list might be proficient in more than one field, it is NOT organized by field, but rather by username. If you add yourself, use the following format, and add yourself **alphabetically**.
[[code]]
: [[*user username]] : fields of expertise
[[/code]]
Note that the following rule is now ironclad, after some unintentional silliness when this page was first posted:

> ++ ##red|**PLEASE DO NOT PUT YOURSELF ON THIS LIST UNLESS YOU FULFILL THE FOLLOWING REQUIREMENTS:**##
> * **You must have have either a degree, significant professional experience (meaning at least several years), or have detailed historical knowledge in the field.** If you are merely a hobbyist or have some passing academic interest in a subject, you should not consider yourself a subject matter expert.
> * **You must be regularly available via forums and IRC.** If people can't easily get ahold of you, then you're not really helpful.
> * **You must be willing to help others with your subject matter expertise.** This isn't a dick-waving contest, this is an effort to get people in contact with experts who can help them with technical details.
> * **Please defer to active contributors.** Even if you are a valid subject matter expert, sometimes what a prospective author needs requires the touch of someone who also knows how to hit the sweet spot for writing in this community as well.

If you want to make yourself available for reference on stuff you're a hobbyist at, feel free to list that //in the comments on the thread named "Non-profession Helpers"//.
