**Item #:** SCP-088

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:**  SCP-088 is to remain sealed in its airtight case at all times.  The case is constructed of transparent acrylic plastic to resist the corrosive properties of SCP-088's secretions.  In the event that SCP-088 should awaken from hibernation any room that it is stored within should be constructed of durable plastics, rubber or ceramics to hinder its ability to escape.  Temperature of SCP-088's containment should not exceed 15 degrees Celsius and any personnel entering containment must observe level 4 hazardous material protocols and wear the appropriate protective gear at all times.

Any personnel who do not observe proper containment protocols in presence of SCP-088 or who show signs of physical mutation are to be demoted to D-class and held for observation.


**Description:**  SCP-088 is a humanoid with reptilian features which appears to have been mummified in a languid posture.  However, SCP-088 is merely in a state of hibernation from which it may recover if it is again exposed to a more hospitable environment than its current containment.  Research has indicated that the SCP-088 is approximately 6000 years old and is capable of secreting a variety of hazardous biological compounds from its mouth and hands.  Some of these substances could be of great strategic value if replicated, but until a means to extract them without awakening SCP-088 is found research into this area is on hold.  

SCP-088 was recovered with the mummified remains of 23 beings sharing a similar morphology.  However, none of these beings were alive and examination suggests that they were originally human.  Information obtained by Agents E088-3 and E088-7 and their subsequent mutation due to SCP-088 exposure corroborates this theory.

**Addendum:**  SCP-088 was recovered in 193█ from a subterranean complex below Los Angeles, California.  The site was originally discovered by G W█████ S██████ using a device he called a "radio X-ray," which was little more than a mechanical dowsing rod.  While S██████'s methods were dubious his discovery was not.  After mapping a series of tunnels and gold deposits below the city S██████ declared that he had found the lost city of the Lizard People as described in the legends of Arizona's Hopi tribe.  S██████'s claims went as far as to be featured on the front page of the //Los Angeles Times// on January 29th, 1934 before the Foundation was able to verify his claims and silence Mr. S██████.  

The subterranean complex was not nearly as complex as described in legend, and most of the artifacts recovered within were too corroded to provide significant information save for a long message carved into the rock wall of an unfinished tunnel.  For partial translation of this text see Document 088-14.

**Containment breach overview**  In more than 70 years of containment SCP-088 has only roused from its state of hibernation twice, breaching containment with a caustic fluid that dissolves most minerals and metals.  Each time multiple personnel were exposed to a second compound which SCP-088 uses to propagate itself: Affected personnel underwent a painful mutation after which they began to share the physical characteristics of SCP-088.  Those few who received a large dosage of the compound, administered directly via mouth-to-mouth contact, were changed the fastest and subsequently sacrificed themselves to protect SCP-088 from harm.  SCP-088 has also demonstrated the ability to produce potent neurotoxins in liquid and gaseous form to combat containment personnel.

Containment during the second breach was reachieved by isolating SCP-088 and affected personnel in the facility and lowering the temperature.  Affected personnel built a pedestal from discarded equipment, upon which SCP-088 took a recumbent position before slipping back into hibernation.  The mutated personnel were neutralized at this point and SCP-088 was returned to containment.

The current strategy of lowered temperature and non-metallic containment has been successful in keeping SCP-088 isolated.  SCP-088 was reclassified to safe status on November ██, 19██.
