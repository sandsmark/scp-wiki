Oliver was the first one to wake the next day, and he took the time between his waking and Dictator’s eventual waking to ponder on the set of circumstances which brought him here.

Anyone who looked at the cat would be able to tell, almost immediately, that something was... different about him. He did not behave like a normal tiger, not even tame ones that people usually kept as pets. There was something almost human about him. But then, that would not be surprising.

That was because Oliver himself was a human.

Though he was not currently human, Oliver had the brain and memories of being human. He had died nearly four years ago now, the date of his death coinciding with the date of the birth of his new body. Looking down at his paws, he unsheathed his claws, gently gripping the sheets of the hard bed beneath him.

To say he missed being human would be an understatement. Oliver yearned to be human again, so he got as close to it in this body as he could. He could read, and use rudimentary signs to “speak.” But most of all, he protected the human he loved the most with everything he had.

And that human was Dictator.

As they stirred next to him, Oliver’s tail twitched and he chuffed, looking over his shoulder at the small human. Dictator’s eyes were half-open, and they smiled wide at him.

“Hey, boy. You thinkin’ about stuff again?”

Oliver closed his eyes and exhaled a purr, before getting up to rest his great head on Dictator’s chest. They scratched behind his ears, and he twitched his tail tip in gratitude.

Life as a tiger was not so bad, after all.

Dictator was slower to start than usual, but Oliver did not seem particularly rushed. He simply sat down and groomed himself while Dictator ate breakfast (a bowl of cereal that had been pushed through the door) and got ready for the day.

Eli did not come in until a few minutes before Dictator was finished. Oliver knew this because, unlike Dictator, his sensitive hearing could pick up the noise of the door to the observation chamber opening and closing. Eli was the only person who came in and out, so it was reasonable to assume that it was he who entered it.

Moments later, Eli’s voice came over the intercom. “Hey kid, you almost ready to get going today? I’ve got somethin’ to show you.”

“What is it?” Dictator asked, eyes shining. Oliver purred at the sound of their enthusiasm

“It’s... well, it’s a special one, that’s for sure,” Eli replied hesitantly. “But probably something you’ll be interested in.”

“Okay... what do you think, Oliver?” Dictator asked, turning to face the tiger. He chuffed in response, playfully butting his head against Dictator’s shoulder.

//Whatever it is, I’ll protect you. Even if it isn’t dangerous, I’ll still protect you. You are all that matters in my life, my Charge.//

Oliver liked to think that, somewhere inside of them, Dictator knew what they were saying.

“So where are we going today?” Dictator asked, trying to keep in step with Eli. Oliver trotted beside them, easily keeping up with the two humans.

“We’re gonna be looking after two today, the first one for two hours and the second one for four,” Eli replied. “First one is [[[SCP-237]]], technically -2 instances, though. There’s sixteen of them in total, fourteen of them speak Japanese, and of those fourteen only three are known to speak English.”

“Oh. Well, will I be able to talk to any of them?”

“Maybe, if they’re interested. They don’t really talk much nowadays. They’re all pretty sure their creator is dead.”

“...Oh. Well... was he... or, maybe they... like mine?”

“From what I’ve heard, their creator wasn’t exactly a nice guy. I think they’re better off without him, but they seem to think otherwise.” Eli paused to look down at Dictator. “Do you miss your Overseer?”

“No,” Dictator replied quickly. “But I did at first. He was all I ever knew. Maybe these guys just need time to mourn and move on.”

Eli fell silent, and stayed silent until they approached the door to the temporary holding area where some of the instances were being kept and allowed to communicate with each other, as they were displaying good behavior. Dictator peered around Eli to get a glance at the instances as he opened the door.

“So they’re... statues?”

The instances were situated behind a thin glass panel, with multiple cameras trained on them from inside of the containment area. Eli nodded, sitting down in a chair behind the control panel itself. Dictator sat down next to him.

“Yeah, kind of. They’re made of clay and polymer, but they’re pretty soft. It’s like... they haven’t been baked, y’know?”

“Got it.”

Dictator stared at the glass panel for a while, before one of the statues -- what appeared to be an emperor penguin -- started staring back at them. Dictator swallowed heavily, then turned their head away, apparently unnerved.

“I... think I understand how they feel,” Dictator finally said. “But I don’t think -- no, I know -- //they// don’t have the ability to understand how they feel just yet.”

Dictator fell silent, and no one spoke after that.

[[[SCP-2715]]] was, at first in Dictator’s eyes, slightly underwhelming.

“She’s just a girl,” Dictator said, looking from the video feed to Eli. “I mean -- look at her. What’s anomalous about her?”

“Ask her yourself,” Eli shrugged, leaning back in his chair and propping his heels up on the control panel. “She doesn’t get many people talking to her regularly. She says it’s fine, but I don’t believe her.”

“Uh... okay. How do I use the intercom?”

“This button.” Eli guided Dictator’s hand over to the red button, and they pressed down on it with a bit more force than was necessary.

“Uh... hi there,” Dictator finally said after a few moments. The girl turned her head towards the observation chamber, though she could not see the people inside. “So, uh, let’s get down to business I guess -- I mean, crap, this isn’t business, but uh -- what’s your name?”

The girl blinked twice in Dictator’s general direction. “My name is Daniela. Who are you? You don’t sound like personnel.”

“That’s because I’m not, I’m Dictator, and I’m an anomaly too, but apparently I get special privileges because I’m a ... Thaumiel. Whatever that means.”

“You contain other anomalies, then,” Daniela said, a statement instead of a question. “You must be very important if you’re allowed to leave your cell.”

“Er, yeah, I guess, but I have to be watched all the time.” Dictator paused before speaking again. “So what’d they put you in here for?”

“They didn’t, I came here on my own. It’s safer here than it is out there, at least for me.” Daniela sighed. “I killed someone with my powers. I used to work for the Chaos Insurgency.”

“Oh... well, I won’t judge you for that, since I’ve killed people too. I don’t know what the Chaos Insurgency is, though.”

“Good. Stay away from them, nothing good will come out of it.”

“Well, if they’re as bad as you say, I doubt the Foundation would let me know about them anyway. What exactly are your powers?”

“I’m immune to all biotoxic substances, and when I ingest them I pass them through me sneezing to other people. When they catch it, it’s twice as bad as if they had caught it normally. It usually kills them,” she explained. “The Insurgency gave me these powers when I was twelve.”

“Oh.” Dictator was quiet for a moment. “So, uh, by the way, I don’t really have any friends here. Do you think we could... y’know, just maybe... be friends?”

There was a pause from inside of the cell. “Sure. I guess it can’t hurt.”

Eli smiled from behind Dictator and closed his eyes as the homunculus excitedly chattered on with their new friend.
