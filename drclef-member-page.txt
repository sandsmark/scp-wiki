**Name:** A█████ H████ C███

**Operator's Tag:** Dr. Alto Clef

**Security Clearance Level:** 

**Current Assignment:** Archivist, Special Containment Procedures.
Lead Researcher, [[[SCP-447]]]

**Profile:** The Entity known as "Dr. Alto Clef" maintains that its true name is that of an A major chord played on a ukelele, which it carries around with it at all times should other entities wish to address it by name. It has recieved its current nickname due to its habit of signing reports with a hand-drawn Alto Clef symbol. Although apparently competent at its job, its acerbic attitude and habit of annoying its coworkers by walking around minimal security areas with unfurled cinnamon rolls stuck in its nose has gained it the enmity of several of its coworkers.

A. Clef cannot be photographed by any known means, but appears to have a sizable nose and a large grin resembling that of //Felis cheshiricus//, the only known specimen of which was captured by [DATA EXPUNGED] during Operation Liddell. It has one green eye, one blue eye, and one hazel eye, both of which appear to have pupils which absorb all light falling upon it. The entity is known to be an inveterate liar regarding all things save SCP-related issues, and thus, should not be trusted by anyone.

By no means should A. Clef be allowed to consume more than seven Altoids mints at one sitting.

**History:** A█████ H████ C███ first came to the attention of the Foundation after publishing a seminal research paper, "On the use of Human Semen to ████ ███████ ██ █████ █████████," which resulted in his expulsion from ██████████ University's Biology department, having already been on probation for complaints rising from his psychology study, "On the Comparative Sensitivity of the Human Female Nipple in Laboratory and Field Conditions, upon Aware and Unaware Subjects." The paper in question referred to a ██████ ████████ with traits resembling those of an existing SCP, resulting in the Foundation contacting the individual in order to establish his security risk.

It is not clear how A█████ H████ C███ managed to ingratiate himself with the investigating agent enough to convince her to offer him a job with the Foundation, as the individual has a slimy personality that causes all females within ██ ██████ to instinctively recoil in horror, clutching their ███████ protectively. However, his acquisition came with the retrieval of [[[SCP-447]]], which has proven remarkably useful to the Foundation despite special containment requirements keeping it away from dead bodies.
