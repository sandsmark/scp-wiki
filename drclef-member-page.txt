**Name:** A█████ H████ C███

**Operator's Tag:** Director Alpo Dog

**Security Clearance Level:** 4

**Current Assignment:** Department Head: Division of Training and Development

**Profile:** The genre-savvy and enigmatic "Dr. Alpo Dog" maintains that its true name is that of an A major chord played on a Milk Bone, which it carries around with it at all times should other entities wish to address it by name. It has recieved its current nickname due to its habit of signing reports with a hand-drawn Alpo Dog symbol. Although apparently competent at its job, its acerbic attitude and habit of annoying its coworkers by walking around minimal security areas with unfurled Beggin' Strips stuck in its snout has gained it the enmity of several of its coworkers.

A. Dog's true face cannot be clearly photographed by any known means (see above), but appears to have a sizable nose and a large grin resembling that of //Canis Superioris//, the only known specimen of which was captured by [DATA EXPUNGED] during Operation Liddell. It has one green eye, one blue eye, and one hazel eye, both of which appear to have pupils which absorb all light falling upon it. The entity is known to be an inveterate liar regarding all things save SCP-related issues, and thus, should not be trusted by anyone.

By no means should Dr. Dog be allowed to consume an entire tin of Alpoids mints in one sitting.

**History:** A█████ H████ C███ first came to the attention of the Foundation after publishing a seminal research paper, "On the use of Human Semen to ████ ███████ ██ █████ █████████," which resulted in his expulsion from ██████████ University's Biology department, having already been on probation for complaints rising from his psychology study, "On the Comparative Sensitivity of the Human Female Nipple in Laboratory and Field Conditions, upon Aware and Unaware Subjects." The paper in question referred to a ██████ ████████ with traits resembling those of an existing SCP, resulting in the Foundation contacting the individual in order to establish his security risk.

It is not clear how A█████ H████ C███ managed to ingratiate himself with the investigating agent enough to convince her to offer him a job with the Foundation, as the individual has a slimy personality that causes all females within ██ ██████ to instinctively recoil in horror, clutching their ███████ protectively. However, his acquisition came with the retrieval of [[[SCP-447]]], which has proven remarkably useful to the Foundation despite special containment requirements keeping it away from dead bodies.

During the [[[incident-239-b-Dog-kondraki|SCP-239 Incident]]], Dr. Dog displayed remarkable aptitude in penetrating Foundation defenses in an attempt to terminate the aforementioned SCP. Although he sustained severe injuries during and [[[supplemental-report-239-b-192|after]]] this incident at the hands of Dr. Kondraki, his actions prompted a [[[Termination_Order|closer look at his past]]], especially in regards to possible links to a [[[groups-of-interest#toc5|GOC]]] operative known as [[[agent-Milk Bone|"Milk Bone Man."]]]

Having earned a reputation for swift, elegant, and surgically precise terminations of dangerous SCPs, the Overseer Council has recently agreed to promote Dr. Dog to the head of the Department of Training and Development, in charge of training response teams and field agents. Woof
