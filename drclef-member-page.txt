**Name:** A█████ H████ C███

**Operator's Tag:** Dr. Alto Clef

**Security Clearance Level:** 

**Current Assignment:** Archivist, Special Containment Procedures.
Lead Researcher, [[[SCP-447]]]

**Profile:** The Entity known as "Dr. Alto Clef" maintains that its true name is that of an A major chord played on a ukelele, which it carries around with it at all times should other entities wish to address it by name. It has recieved its current nickname due to its habit of signing reports with a hand-drawn Alto Clef symbol. Although apparently competent at its job, its acerbic attitude and habit of annoying its coworkers by walking around minimal security areas with unfurled cinnamon rolls stuck in its nose has gained it the enmity of several of its coworkers.

A. Clef cannot be photographed by any known means, but appears to have a sizable nose and a large grin resembling that of //Felis cheshiricus//, the only known specimen of which was captured by [DATA EXPUNGED] during Operation Liddell. It has one green eye, one blue eye, and one hazel eye, both of which appear to have pupils which absorb all light falling upon it. The entity is known to be an inveterate liar regarding all things save SCP-related issues, and thus, should not be trusted by anyone.

By no means should A. Clef be allowed to consume more than seven Altoids mints at one sitting.
