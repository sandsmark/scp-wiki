    **Item #:** SCP-151

    **Object Class:** Keter

    **Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-151 should be kept in a locked storage compartment and its face should be covered by a cloth.  The keys to the compartment should be kept in the custody of the site commander when it is not being researched.  When research is being conducted, the SCP may be kept in a locked laboratory, provided it is always covered when not being used.

    **Description:** SCP-151 is a 5"x6" oil painting, apparently from the perspective of someone underwater.  A subject who views the painting exhibits no initial effects.  Over a period of 24 hours their breathing becomes increasingly labored, culminating in the death of the subject.  Autopsies reveal the lungs have filled with seawater.  Attempts the halt the process by medical intervention have proved successful in prolonging the life of the subject, but have not reversed the condition. 

The painting is not signed, but several names are written on the back.

    **Addendum:**SCP-151 was found in an antique shop in █████████, ███, after the Institute began investigating a series of drowning deaths apparently caused by SCP.  As ███ is landlocked, the Institute dispatched a team of plainsclothes Agents after being informed of the nature of the water in the victim's lungs and that the victims had all been discovered on dry land.  The Agents discovered that the names written on the back belonged to a group of artistically-inclined students, all of whom disappeared during a study-abroad program in ███████.  Investigation into their fate is ongoing, and may provide clues as to the nature and origin of the SCP.
