[[/div]]**Item #:** SCP-181

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-181 lives in the class D personnel dormitories on Bio-Research Area-12 . SCP-181 is for all intents and purposes a Level 0 clearance personnel, knowing vaguely the nature of the SCP without any sensitive information having been revealed. Researchers and surveillance staff are reminded to not single SCP-181 out of his class D group.  SCP-181 is to be rotated to a new dorm once a month instead of regulation class D termination.  SCP-181 is not to be submitted to any new or Keter classified SCP testing sessions.

**Description:** G████ O██████, formerly LvD-87465, had been incarcerated for repeated offenses of defrauding the Nevada Gaming Commission. Following the 18th month of his life sentence, he was quietly moved to Armed Reliquary Containment Area-02, where he was initiated and assigned a Level D clearance. His first exposure experiment was with [[[SCP-047]]], the results were bloody but expected. A LvD-65468 was exposed to [[[SCP-047]]], he rampaged and killed those in the room, SCP-181 was spared when an armed response team put down LvD-65468.

SCP-181 was included into an experiment with [[[SCP-075]]] the week following the incident with [[[SCP-047]]]. It was during this test that SCP-181's unnatural effect on probability was discovered. When placed in the containment chamber with an activated [[[SCP-075]]] to measure its speed and reflex time, SCP-181 managed to avoid [[[SCP-075]]] a total of 3 times before suppression teams refroze [[[SCP-075]]].

Having survived not one but two Keter class exposure experiments SCP-181 was a statistical anomaly. It would be his third week and full seven days of survival with [[[SCP-082]]] that prompted Dr. G███ D██ to investigate.

It was Dr. G███ D██'s hypothesis that SCP-181 was generating these statistical anomalies without his knowledge. After nearly flipping 50 heads on a coin, rolling 25 7s on a pair of dice, and pulling all 13 hearts out of a standard deck of playing cards, Dr. G███ D██ got executive permission to experiment with [[[SCP-777]]]. After rolling 19 green circles and succeeding in recreating 4 classical masterpieces of varying art forms, SCP-181 rolled [[[SCP-777]]] and as the object came to rest on the red triangle the facility experienced a tremor caused by an incident with [[[SCP-216]]] and [[[SCP-777]]] fell on a green circle. Dr. G███ D██ then reclassified  LvD-87465 as SCP-181, sparing him from the routine monthly termination of class D personnel.

SCP-181 shows signs of affecting the causal probability around him by no will of his own. However, tests show that efforts to remove as much chance from an event as possible reduce SPC-181's effect on the event. 

**Notes to personnel:** It has come to my understanding that class D guard staff have been feeding current sports news to 181. You are to be reminded that SCP detainees are not to have contact with the outside world. Discontinue this practice before severe reprimands are implemented. Dr. G███ D██
