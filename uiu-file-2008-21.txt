[[tab Event/Locale Preface]]

**Event Discovery:** A sudden out of season blizzard was detected by meteorological equipment in Portland Recon Camp Bravo. Further information revealed the blizzard to be localized to Boring, Oregon, a city 20 miles from Portland. Strike Team Bravo-01 was dispatched to investigate the unusuality. 

**Locale Summary (Pre-Event):** Transdimensional Hotspot US-1221, AKA Boring, Oregon, is a convergence of transdimensional waypoints with a US citizen community. The local population regards supernatural events as normal. Area is under SCP Foundation supervision. 

An organization dedicated to the capture and rehabilitation of supernatural fauna by the name of 'Wilson's Wildlife Shelter' is based out of THUS-1221. 

**Locale Summary (Post-Event):** Boring suffered intense snowfall, which quickly melted following the stabilization of weather patterns. Minor flooding persisted for a week following. Efforts to rebuild the Wilson Center and provide disaster relief to Boring are ongoing.

Wilson's Wildlife Shelter is now an affiliate of the SCP Foundation. As per the Boring Agreement, the United States government maintains a joint jurisdiction of the area alongside the SCP Foundation and affiliated parties.

**Modus Operandi:** Creature wandered aimlessly through Boring while scavenging for food. 

**Behavior:** The creature was highly hostile to UIU agents and WWS members alike. It avoided areas with large civilian populations and overturned a dumpster.

I just want to talk to her and let her know we're going to cover her expenses. I think I might have to take out another loan, but it'll be a-okay.

> **Wilson:** I don't know! The donations are anonymous. Now look, mister, it's been real nice but I'm getting antsy and my folks out there are shaking in their boots, not just 'cause of the cold. I need to go talk to them and tell them this is all going to be a-okay.
