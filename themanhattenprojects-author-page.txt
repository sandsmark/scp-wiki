title:TheManhattenProject's Author Page
[[module Rate]]

I finally got a decent author page working (hopefully). If something borks I'll get on to it. By the way, the scp article listed is actually a rewrite, I need to see how to remove it.

[[module CSS]]
.preview .span, .infobox { display: none !important; }
[[/module]]

[[include component:author-page
      order=created_at |
      perpage=100 |
      background=yes |
      image=yes |
    ]]

If anything else I find cool pops up, I'll put it here.
