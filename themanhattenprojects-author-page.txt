I finally got a decent author page working (hopefully). If something borks I'll get on to it. By the way, the scp article listed (3502) is actually a rewrite, I need to see how to remove it.

[[module CSS]]
.preview .span, .infobox { display: none !important; }
[[/module]]

[[include component:author-page
      order=created_at |
      perpage=100 |
      background=yes |
      image=yes |
    ]]

If anything else I find cool pops up, I'll put it here.
[[collapsible  show="In case I end up inactive" hide="close"]]

In the event that I end up inactive from the wiki for a long lasting period (6 months to forever), then all things like deletions, licensing, etc, about my articles are to be directed to [[*user dentixvoxel]], lest otherwise. All co-authored articles are to be directed to their respective co-authors. If there is no activity from me for one year, this includes //zero// activity from Discord, IRC, and the wiki, then assume that I have passed away due to some accident (intentional or not). If I can find someway to prove that, whether it be a bot or a close friend, I will.
That is all.
