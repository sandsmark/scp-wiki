**Item #:** SCP-3315

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3315 should be kept inside a copper-shielded thermal insulation locker and stored within the Site-76 Low-Risk Inanimate Objects Warehouses when not in use. All personnel interested in research with the object must first obtain approval from project head prior to experimentation. Additionally, personnel requests for testing purposes requires administrative approval and several rounds of D-Class screening prior to admission.  

All testing is to be recorded and observed from within Site-76's experimentation chambers. This chamber should be retrofitted with a Faraday mesh and shielded with T-3 thermal insulation pods that must be inspected daily by members of research staff.

**Description:** SCP-3315 is the designation for a 25 cm black aluminum ice pick with "p e r s e v e r a n c e"[[footnote]]It is to note that the white spacing between letters is intentional. [[/footnote]] engraved onto its handle. The object itself is comprised of non-anomalous material, with a handle composed of the carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastic featuring an aluminum carabiner ring on the blunt end. 

SCP-3315 is abnormally cold, registering in at about 193K (approximately -79.4 °C) and requiring use of protective equipment when handling the device. On the ring of the handle is a single handwritten note, laminated and attached via plastic zip-tie.[[footnote]]Attempts to remove or otherwise alter the components of SCP-3315 have failed.[[/footnote]] The note reads as follows:

> O wanderer, struck forth on heaven's eye
> 
> What mysteries of yonder frozen ridges hide?
> 
> Steal your fate with the pick on high
> 
> When you climb to reach perseverance's side


When an individual firmly grasps SCP-3315 and lifts it completely, they will disappear from all visual and global positioning systems. The subject will then be translocated to an alternate locality defined as SCP-3315-1. During this period, audio broadcasting reception can still be detected with decent clarity within two kilometers of the point from which SCP-3315 had vanished. 

Once the subject appears within SCP-3315-1, they will be unrecoverable until they expire, whereupon they reemerge alive and unscathed within SCP-3315's original location. During the event, subjects are unable to die of hunger, thirst, or asphyxiation,[[footnote]]However, they have been noted to report symptoms of such things without dying from them directly.[[/footnote]] nor will they be able to lose SCP-3315, intentionally or otherwise. All other forms of termination seem to work without issue.

SCP-3315-1 appears to be a single mountain range of unknown size, subject to a dense fog that obscures the surrounding area. Topological expeditions of SCP-3315 have yielded inconclusive data, suggesting that SCP-3315-1 is not located on Earth and is randomly generated with each instance of its manifestation. Despite this, certain items and features have been shown to reappear in different manifestations of SCP-3315-1. Research into how SCP-3315 constructs its reality is still under analysis.

**Addendum-3315-A:** Discovery and Recovery Log

SCP-3315 was brought to Foundation attention on 05/11/02 after the hospitalization of trailer park supervisor Francis ████████, who had claimed to have suffered several delusional/psychotic episodes in which he had found himself with lost time and in an unknown location. ████████ states that he had been cleaning out the unit of a tenant who was presumed dead in a housefire three days prior, when he was transported to SCP-3315-1 and perished rapidly due to hypothermia. After reappearing, he had attempted to return to work several times before finally admitting himself to a nearby hospital. A Foundation agent stationed as a nurse reported the claims and an official investigation was deployed.

████████'s tenant records were seized and determined that the lot in question had belonged to a █████ ██████, it is unknown if this is a real name or not, as no other records of such individual were registered within █████████████ County nor any of the surrounding counties. ████████ was unable to provide any further details about the individual, stating that they were invalid and that they had rarely interacted with the person question. It should be noted that no remains were discovered among the wreckage of the trailer.

Foundation efforts to properly identify SCP-3315 took place over the next day, during which its anomalous properties came to light. Anomalous Items Recovery Unit 33B ("Scavengers") was assigned to the location. Records of their debriefing can be found below.

> //Note: Following is a transcript of AIRU-33B member Agent Mackenzie Driscoll's debrief post-recovery of SCP-3315 to Site-76 Director Mahmoodah Agarwal.//

> -----
> 
> <BEGIN TRANSCRIPT>
> 
> **Director Agarwal:** Alright, Agent Driscoll, if you would.
> 
> **Agent Driscoll:** Okay- [clears throat] Agent Mackenzie Driscoll, Anomalous Items Recovery Division thirty-three-bee, May fifteenth, two-thousand and-
> 
> **Director Agarwal:** Just- please describe your experience when you were recovering the object. For the record.
> 
> **Agent Driscoll:** Ah, sorry. We don't really get anything this interesting, usually. Anyway, we were deployed to [REDACTED], some trailer park out there in the pine barrens, and Jacobs- Agent Jacobs- was on the job with me at the time. So, we drove out there and started poking around the burned-up unit. Jacobs was the first to notice something off about the place, I mean it was cold. Like, we stepped into what was left of the trailer and it just felt wrong. Not in a bad way, mind you, but it was weird.
> 
> **Director Agarwal:** Care to go into more detail?
> 
> **Agent Driscoll:** Well, I then noticed the smell. It was frigid in there, and it smelled like we were outside. Like, I could taste the snow and the mountains instead of smoke and burned plastic. It was refreshing, but we were not dressed for the cold, and everything in the trailer was damp and covered in soot. Jacobs saw the pick after a minute or so, in perfect condition, and he reached for it, barely lifted the thing off the ground before he just up and vanished. The next thirty minutes were a blur. I radioed in that Jacobs had gone missing and I remember that Site Command was in a bit of an argument about whether or not to dispatch a more, uh, trained group before I heard Jacobs yelling from inside the trailer.
> 
> **Director Agarwal:** And what did you do then?
> 
> **Agent Driscoll:** I went back inside, of course. Jacobs was young. Not his first roundup, mind you, but this was something different. He was shivering and sobbing, and I just held him until the rest of 'em showed up. He was going on about the cold and the endless snow, babbling like a baby but otherwise unharmed. I'm just glad he was wearing his gloves, because he probably would have lost a few fingers if he wasn't. 
> 
> **Director Agarwal:** Alright. What about the pick?
>  
> **Agent Driscoll:** It was just lying there next to him, inanimate. I knew not to touch the damned thing. A little while later more recovery agents showed up, Abernathy and Pierce, and I warned them not to touch it either. They got some tongs and put the pick in a plastic bag and we brought it onsite.
> 
> **Director Agarwal:** Thank you, Agent Driscoll. That about covers it.
> 
> **Agent Driscoll:** No problem, ma'am.

> **D-85748:** Wh- Oh fuck- [muffled] Ah- ah- I can't- [sounds of struggle and a sharp whine in the microphone can be heard] -Ow. Agh. Okay. Okay.
> 
> **Agent Langstaff:** D-85748, are you alright?
> 
> **D-85748:** Yeah, but I'm stuck. Some snow moved and- I'm caught underneath. Oh god. You have to send someone to help me.
> 
> **Agent Langstaff:** I'm sorry, but that is not possible at this time. Can you dig yourself out?
> 
> **D-85748:** Ah, let me try. Okay - [strains]

> 
> **D-85748:** No, I can't get out, and I think I'm stuck for serious. 
> 
> **Agent Langstaff:** Okay, don't panic. We are going to talk you through this.
> 
> //Agent Langstaff remains in contact with D-85748 for the remainder of his shift, instructing him on how to conserve his body heat while aiding him in melting snow for drinking. Soon after, Agent Wyatt takes over.//
> 
>  **Agent Wyatt:** Hey, D-85748. This is Agent Wyatt. So, I don't know if this is good news for you, but you aren't going to die like this, especially not by thirst.
> 
> **D-85748:** [exhales] -Well that isn't helping me right now. I still feel it, the pain. And I'm so //goddamn// hungry. It's so cold.
> 
>  **Agent Wyatt:** Don't worry, we will get through this.
> 
> **D-85748:** [chuckles] Yeah, I will persevere.
> 
>  **Agent Wyatt:** Hey- [coughs] yeah, that's it. Have you still got your pick?
> 
> **D-85748:** Huh? Oh- yeah look at that. Its half-buried next to me.
> 
>  **Agent Wyatt:**  See if you can get yourself out, okay?

Following Exploration Log 3315-1-C, SCP-3315 does not reappear in Site-76 for three years, six months and twelve days. Radio contact with D-85748 was attempted daily, however, the subject remained uncooperative, leaving his earpiece disabled for most of the time, and occasionally activating the headset to goad personnel and reiterate his "victory". D-85748 and SCP-3315 are both recovered without hassle, D-85748 is promptly terminated upon his arrival and subsequent interrogation.[[/collapsible]]
