**Item #:** SCP-1158                            

**Object Class:**  Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** As additional specimens of SCP-1158 are known to exist in the wild, the specimen  currently housed at Site 19, Hazardous Lifeforms Wing is designated SCP-1158a. SCP-1158a requires a 50m x 50m x 50m Lexan enclosure containing rainforest habitat transplanted from its natural surroundings. Habitat temperature will be maintained at 30^^0^^ C; embedded misting systems will regulate humidity levels at 70%. Full-spectrum retractable sensor pods are embedded at 10m interval in a grid pattern throughout the enclosure to observe behavior and feeding. The enclosure will be accessed through a positive pressure airlock for enclosure and habitat maintenance. Said maintenance will be performed weekly by a team of Level 1 personnel equipped with Tyvek exposure suits with scent masking apparatus, accompanied by an MTF operative armed with a standard issue M870 shotgun. Under no circumstances are flame weapons or fire to be used on or near SCP-1158a. Feeding of SCP-1158a will occur once every 45 days. Prey item will consist of one (1) naked D-class subject scheduled for termination.
 
**Description:** SCP-1158 is an airborne, carnivorous arboreal predator closely resembling a very large olive drab Portuguese man-o-war (Physalia physalis), and shares its colonial polyp attributes.  Known habitat currently consists of deciduous rainforest within a 500km radius surrounding ████████, ████████. Research on deceased specimens has shown that SCP-1158a’s large, four (4) meter pneumatophore is filled with a naturally occurring (bacteria decay) form of hydrogen, providing lift. While airborne, SCP-1158a nestles itself high in the canopy layer, allowing its feeding and detecting polyps to hang down through the understorey to the forest floor. These polyps are effectively camouflaged among the various vines and branches present. The dactylozooid polyp bundles are, to a limited degree, prehensile, thus owing to SCP-1158a’s nickname among research staff. SCP-1158a has not been observed at an altitude greater than the canopy emergent layer, seemingly preferring to remain silently hidden beneath the foliage.

Prey appears limited, so far, to human beings. Once a human makes contact with dactylozooid polyps lying on the ground or adjacent to a tree, nematocysts in the polyp strands inject a paralyzing neurotoxin while nearby polyp threads wrap around the victim's extremities. Experimentation with D-Class personnel indicates that envenomation and envelopment take approximately 6 seconds. At this time primary feeding polyps enter the victim’s [DATA REDACTED] and begin to anchor themselves throughout the gastrointestinal system. Once anchored, powerful digestive enzymes are delivered which break down internal organs for absorption by the polyps. The process has been observed to last approximately ██ days, with the victim expiring approximately ██  days after capture. During the feeding process, it has been observed that specimens of SCP-1158 will use  tendrils to "move" the victim's extremities upon sensing the approach of humans in an attempt at luring.

 SCP-1158a was discovered on █/█/20██, approximately 400km from ███,  ██████, during deforestation operations pursuant to the construction of the █████  █████ and ██████ near the ███████ River. Two days after several advance parties went missing, subsequent search teams located two party members seemingly at rest near the buttresses of a large Ceiba tree. The two subjects were initially unresponsive, then appeared to be “waving” the search teams over for assistance; when approached, it was observed the two subject’s arms were suspended by “very thin vines that were making them move”. As the search team's medical personnel moved to assist, team members began stepping on and making contact with feeding polyps from several specimens of SCP-1158 hovering nearby, at which point [DATA REDACTED], resulting in ██ casualties. Subsequent newspaper reports garnered the attention of the Foundation, which then moved to have the area quarantined.

**Addendum:** **Observation Log, SCP-1158a1**
//Observational testing is ongoing. All testing conducted at Hazardous Lifeforms Wing, Site 19, Senior Researcher H recording.//

**Date/time:** 4MAR12 15:00:00
**Temperature:** 31^^0^^ C
**Specimen:** //One (1) Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris, designated specimen A//
**Observations:** //Specimen A introduced into enclosure via airlock. Specimen A observed wandering the habitat for approximately forty- five minutes, occasionally making contact with SCP-1158a’s detection polyps. No envenomation observed; no polyp tendril movement detected. After an additional twenty minutes, Specimen A coaxed towards airlock and removed from enclosure.//

**Date/time:** 4MAR12 15:00:00
**Temperature:** 310 C
**Specimen:** //D-7787, no clothing issued, subdermal vital function monitor implanted, designated Specimen B//
**Observations:** //Specimen B advised that he was being used to test a recreational area simulating a natural rainforest environment. Specimen B was escorted into the enclosure via airlock. Specimen B was observed slowly walking the perimeter of the enclosure into a densely vined area near the buttress roots of the enclosure’s primary tree sample. Specimen B was observed to step on several polyp strands, at which time several tendrils hanging adjacent to him immediately began to wrap around him. Specimen B began to struggle and scream obscenities, then cried out in obvious pain for several seconds before all sound and movement ceased. At this time the feeding polyps were observed entering Specimen B. Specimen B registered no movement or reaction to this. Extremely thin tendrils were observed wrapped around Specimen B’s arms, wrists, and legs; Specimen B’s weight was recorded at 81.60 kg prior to testing; tendrils observed to support the weight easily. Specimen B was observed and recorded being consumed over the next 13 days, a desiccated corpse being discarded on 17MAR12. Specimen B expired at 1500hrs 10MAR12.//

**Date/time:** 15MAR12 15:00:00
**Temperature:** 31^^0^^ C
**Specimen:** //D-7796, no clothing issued, subdermal vital function monitor implanted, designated Specimen C.//

**Observations:** //Specimen C advised that he was being used to test a recreational area simulating a natural rainforest environment. Specimen C was escorted into the enclosure via airlock. Specimen C observed hesitantly moving into the enclosure, shouting various obscenities regarding the heavy odor of decay and the nature of the enclosure. Specimen C was then observed walking slowly across the enclosure holding his right hand over his mouth and nose. At 15:08:15, Specimen C came into visual contact with the encaptured remains of Specimen B. Specimen C began to loudly shout to research staff that there was another subject in the enclosure with him. When a distance of approximately 12m was reached, Specimen B’s left arm was observed to slowly raise; said arm began to sway in a “beckoning” motion. Specimen C then began to move toward Specimen B’s location and began to call out to Specimen B. Upon moving forward, contact was made with exposed sensory tendrils. Envenomation, entrapment, and feeding cycle then followed. Specimen C was observed and recorded being consumed over the next 10 days, expiring on 25MAR12.//
