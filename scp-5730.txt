++++ **__Special Containment Procedures__**
A full blackout protocol is to be initiated on SCP-5730 under the guise of a military operation. Foundation trawlers and ships are to initiate a search for the remaining instances of SCP-5730, with agents additionally stationed in all ports to monitor sightings of SCP-5730. SCP-5730's routes are to be charted. Reports of 'whale-like' or 'jumping' submarines are to be verified.

Captured SCP-5730 instances are to be docked near Site-095 and investigated for their thaumaturgic properties and any documents and video cassette tapes that they may contain.

Embedded agents in PepsiCo are to obtain documents related to the company's sea-based anomalous operations, focusing on dossiers concerning SCP-5730. Existing deals with PepsiCo are to be enhanced in order to further monitor it.

++++ **__Description__**

SCP-5730 refers to a fleet of 17 submarines that were obtained by PepsiCo from the Soviet Union in 1989 as payment for Pepsi products. It has been sighted in several parts of the world, particularly near countries in the Pacific Ocean[[footnote]]Such as the Philippines, Japan, Singapore, and the Polynesian island nations.[[/footnote]]. 

SCP-5730 instances' behavior has been described as similar to orcas, evading nearby ships. [[footnote]]They travel at a speed of 95 km/hr, or nearly double the average of 56 km/hr.[[/footnote]] Video logs show that they typically emerge from the water, remaining in the air for around 15 seconds.

SCP-5730-1 are translucent humanoids observed atop SCP-5730 instances. These entities are unresponsive to communication attempts and show evidence of moderate bodily damage, such as burns and limping. These manage repairs on SCP-5730, while occasionally holding wine bottles, when SCP-5730 are surfaced.

SCP-5730 instances have been severely damaged near the engines and the aft hydroplanes. Their hulls have been cracked and breached to the point that their frames have been exposed. These can be explained as a result of age, as well as damage from SCP-5730's clashes with anomalies.[[footnote]]As seen in its track record. These led to a new Liability Policy, which discusses protocol for laying off personnel.[[/footnote]]

When separated from the other instances by a range of eight kilometers, an instance becomes inactive and non-anomalous, with no signs of SCP-5730-1.

Official records state that SCP-5730 was sold off by PepsiCo in 1989, although it covertly operated until 2005. By then, PepsiCo had officially decommissioned SCP-5730, with its instances docked to be scrapped, before they suddenly disappeared on March 5.

On November 20, several Foundation destroyers near Scarborough Shoal[[footnote]]An island in the West Philippine Sea.[[/footnote]] registered SCP-5730 on their deep-sea scanners. Kilometer-long thaumaturgic barriers were set up at strategic points to block SCP-5730 and force it into an altercation with the destroyers.

Anticipating an End Around attack[[footnote]]This involves the submarine approaching the target's front at maximum speeds.[[/footnote]], the FSS //Jokoy// and //Jose Rizal// braced for impact.  Several instances lobtailed them using their rudders and stern planes, causing moderate damage.

The destroyers deployed depth charges as a response, causing two SCP-5730 instances to surface. SCP-5730-1 instances could be seen manning deck guns atop them while displaying moderate panic.

One instance then emerged and crashed into the //Jokoy//, while other instances mounted surface attacks. The Foundation destroyers then adopted zig-zagging patterns and formations until they managed to separate and capture five instances.

Investigation of the captive instances' interiors has shown several notable modifications, listed below:

# Thaumaturgically-enhanced metal plating has been installed on all instances, allowing them to endure pressures of around 225 atmospheres[[footnote]]Seawolf submarines today can survive up to 100 atmospheres.[[/footnote]]. The plating appears to be based on methods seen in GRU-P and occultist Russian documents.
# The engines and nuclear reactors have been extensively modified.
# Their cargo holds' interiors are larger than what their exteriors would suggest.
# Maps detailing unknown oceanic regions[[footnote]]Accompanied by notes marking the apparent preferences of their inhabitants.[[/footnote]] have been found alongside old PepsiCo posters.
# Heavily degraded photographs depicting unidentified individuals. The phrase 'Ang Buhay Natin Dati'[[footnote]]'Our Lives Back Then' in Tagalog[[/footnote]] is inscribed on them.

[[size 110%]]It has been determined that SCP-5730-1 instances closely resemble a 51-year-old individual named Baler 'Balyena' Suarez, a former PepsiCo employee who served as first officer aboard SCP-5730-A[[footnote]]As part of PepsiCo training, Suarez was instructed in thaumaturgic chants and techniques.[[/footnote]].[[/size]]

[[size 110%]]Records on his status conflicted as March started. Medical records state that he was rushed to the Manila Doctors Hospital due to liver cirrhosis. However, on March 5, he was spotted wearing his old uniform in Subic Bay[[footnote]]22 kilometers away from the hospital.[[/footnote]], where PepsiCo headquartered its anomalous seafaring operations.[[/size]]

[[size 110%]]Videocassette tapes have been recovered from his home and transcribed. Three  tapes are provided below.[[/size]]

[[size 110%]]//Suarez sets up the recorder. His eyes are mildly swollen, and he yawns for several seconds. He then sits on the sofa, unsteadily gripping several documents.//[[/size]]

[[size 110%]]**Suarez:** Takemiko... Job-hunting failed again this time. The guys at Intermodal did not want to accept an old and limping man. (//Faintly chuckles.//) Well, who would anyway?[[/size]]

[[size 110%]]//He then rubs his badly burned face and stretches his limping leg.//[[footnote]]Caused by an altercation involving SCP-5730 and one of PepsiCo's former anomalous partners. He was honorably discharged afterwards.[[/footnote]].[[/size]]

[[size 110%]]I don't know if I... uh - (//Silence for five seconds.//) Sorry for the poor memory. But you see, the physical qualifications screwed me up a lot. In any case, it looks like I won't be on the seas again. Ahh, it's really difficult nowadays.[[/size]]

[[size 110%]]//Suarez coughs for several seconds, and rubs his head. He stands up and turns on the television. He then sits for 12 minutes, switching between several channels. He lingers on those that show basketball and an oceanographic documentary.//[[/size]]

[[size 110%]]//Suarez grabs several tapes from a box, and loads them into a VHS player.//[[/size]]

[[size 110%]]**Suarez:** It's Day 20 now Takemiko... I'm planning something different today, kind of like, uh, a reaction video. I think that I'm the first one to do this sort of thing. Ah, wait, you and Bogda often did this to record your reactions to wild stuff. We had to smuggle these tapes out of the subs back then. (//Chuckles.//)[[/size]]

[[size 110%]]//Suarez plays several tapes. The first depicted Suarez, several other employees, and members of an unidentified group as they rode on several dolphins and whales that carried PepsiCo products. The second showed him manning a control component of SCP-5730-A, with his captain ordering escape maneuvers.//[[/size]]

[[size 110%]]//The third showed his crew drinking in an unidentified tavern, although the tape abruptly cut when he put his foot on the table after being dared.//[[/size]]

[[size 110%]]//Rubbing his calloused fingers and right leg, he grins while watching these tapes.//[[/size]]

[[size 110%]]**Suarez:** Can't believe I used to be so… wild. Without those guys, without Pepsi… I'd still be some deadbeat. Y'know, a life of adventure really was the thing for me, Takemiko... Though... a life full of adventure is something that needs to just roll on. I wish that was the case for me.[[/size]]

[[size 110%]]//Suarez chuckles and turns off the television. He then falls asleep on the sofa. For several minutes, only a faint, clinking sound could be heard.//[[/size]]

[[size 110%]]In any case, don't look for me, and don't worry about me harming something; that won't happen unless I get cornered. To PepsiCo, I'll be taking some of the old whales - after all, they're gonna be scrapped, Quite a waste, if you ask me.[[/size]]

[[size 110%]]//Suarez clears his throat.//[[/size]]

[[size 110%]]**Suarez:** In any case… Look, I just want to have a whale of a good time again. It's time for this old orca to go back to the sea where he belongs. [[/size]]

++++ **__Update (05/07/2006)__**

Reports of 'ocean blazes' and 'explosive sea bursts' in the West Philippine Sea were received by the Philippine branch of the Foundation, and the FSS //Marcelo Del Pilar// was dispatched. On arrival, the //Del Pilar// found the remains of three SCP-5730 instances. It also recovered 35 kg of wooden and leather parts[[footnote]]Usually found in medieval sailing ships.[[/footnote]] and a tentacular mass weighing 32 kg.

Tattered PepsiCo flags, with the words 'King of the Sea Once More' inked on them, were found inside the instances.
