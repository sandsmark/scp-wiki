{{The world was swimming. Colors- vibrant, piercing colors were everywhere.}} 

##ba650b|“D-3975.”##

{{There was no up, no down. No left or right.}}

##ba650b|“D-3975.”##

{{Spinning, swirling, tumbling, floati-}}

##ba650b|“D-3975!”##

Dug’s eyes flew open. He was on his back, face up, in a dark room. He sniffed the air as his eyes adjusted. It smelled like… 

//[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3864 Paint?]//

Where was he? He remembered…goggles, then nothing.

##ba650b|“D-3975! Can you hear me? Where is the group?”##

Dug bolted upright. The group. His friends. Jared, Cray, Nathan, Felix. All holding on to one another, slowly removing the goggles to see the painting. The impeding calm, the slow drain of energy as he lost his color- and then

“I…don’t know, Doc.” Dug stood. “They’re gone.” He glanced over his left shoulder. A leather recliner was in the corner, looking a bit worn. 

##ba650b|“What do you see in there, D-3975?”##

“Not much, Doc,” Dug responded. “There’s a leather chair and…a cabinet? And a rug.”

##ba650b|“Nothing else?”##

//No//

{{“There’s a little girl.”}}

//What?//

{{“She says her name is Tanya.”}}

Dug wondered why he had said that. He hadn’t meant to. Eventually, the doctor spoke:

##ba650b|“Tanny..? No, it can’t be- we’ve never seen more than one person in the painting before. We do not see Tan- this girl. We don’t see your //group//.”##

“I don’t either.” 

##ba650b|“Search for them.”##

Dug approached the recliner and laid a hand on it. It felt smooth and slick, exactly as leather should. He moved on.

He moved to the only windows in the entire room. Big, wide, glorious windows, open to the outside world, except

Dug looked back at his hands and saw brown, dark brown- //leather brown//- smeared on them, and he looked at the recliner and he saw the color of his skin on the chair and-

//I’ve found them, Doc//

{{“They’re not here, Doc. But the girl still is.”}}

//There is no girl//

##ba650b|“You can’t find your group?”##

//They’re outside//

{{“The girl wants me to tell you something.”}}

##ba650b|“Can you or can you not find your group, D-3975?”##

Dug looked out the window again, struggling against his own mind to form the words. To tell the Doctor how his friend Le^^nny^^’s face was smeared into the bark on the {{beautiful}} tree, or how the {{luscious}} branches were T,,er,,^^r^^y’s arms, knurled and twisted, or how the {{endlessly gorgeous}} sky was {{brilliantly}} filled with the pained expressions of his group, {{ingeniously}} contorted and morphed to fill the {{**canvas**}}.

{{“She says that she misses you, ##b23ea1|Daddy##.”}}

##ba650b|“What?”##

//Who said that? Was that me?//

{{“She says she ##b23ea1|misses her Daddy, and she wants her Daddy to come in here##.”}}

//Whatishappening//

##ba650b|“…Tanny…?”##

##b23ea1|{{“It’s been 2 years, Daddy, why haven’t you come home?”}}##

##ba650b|“Oh, Tanny, I’m so sorry, Daddy misses you, my little girl…”##

Dug felt his mouth moving, his lips forming words, but //he wasn’t doing it//. He willed his body to stop, to //listen to his command//, and, oh God, whose voice was coming out of his mouth?

##b23ea1|{{“I miss breakfast on Sunday, Daddy, I miss when you cooked for us! For Mommy and me!”}}## 

Dug heard the doctor begin to cry.

##ba650b|”Tanya, my sweet Tanya, I’m so sorry…I did everything I could…but I didn’t- didn’t even see the car, baby, it came out of nowhere- you and your mother, oh God…“## 

Dug gritted his teeth and willed his body to //fight back//, but-

##b23ea1|{{“I’m still alive, Daddy, in here! Come in here with me, we can make Sunday breakfast again! Mommy and me and you!”}}##

//Why am I saying this what is happening make it stop//

**THUD**

##0e4091|“Sir, your goggles!”##

##ba650b|“Hold on Tanny!”##

//no//

##b23ea1|{{“Daddy?”}}##

//NO//

##ba650b|“Tanny, I’m coming!”##

//**NO**//

__**Test Log 1 - 10/29/2017**__

> **Procedure:** A group of 5 D-Class personnel[[footnote]]D-3971 through D-3975[[/footnote]] were given direct visual exposure of SCP-3864 at the same time.
> 
> **Outcome:** D-3975 was the only subject to appear as SCP-3864-1. Communication with SCP-3864-1 was continuous for approximately 6 minutes before it was able to convince Dr. [REDACTED] to remove his goggles. Dr. [REDACTED] remains the current SCP-3864-1 instance at this time.
> 
> **Conclusion:** SCP-3864 is able to loosely control or influence SCP-3864-1 to “lure” prey. Further testing pending O5 approval.
