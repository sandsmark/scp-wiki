**Additional Notes:** 
Dr. Bright is not allowed physical contact with any intelligent, living SCP not classified as Safe.

--Dr. Bright is not allowed at site 17.-- Having proven himself trustworthy and loyal, Bright is once again allowed at Site 17.

Dr. Bright has proven highly resistant to psychic and emotional manipulation. Whether this is natural, or a function of 963, is both unknown, and untestable.

Jack acts as the unofficial bookie of the Foundation. If someone is betting on it, there's better then even chance that Doc is holding the books. We could shut him down, but it serves as a needed distraction for many of the researchers.

Dr. Bright somehow has been given access over the personnel files. We don't know how this happened, but it sure is entertaining.

//O5 Note://Do not allow Dr. Bright to know, but several of his overwrites have been allowed to live, to work on special projects. Dr Brights 2-7 are assigned as follows [Data Redacted]
