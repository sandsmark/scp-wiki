**Name:**Dr. Jack Bright Also answers to Doc, Dr. J, or "Oh god no." 

****Security Clearance Level:** ██████████

Profession:** Researcher, Mad Scientist, Foundation Bookie

**Location:** Wherever Needed.

**History:** Rose to the top of his field in bioengineering and abnormal genetics. Got recruited by the Foundation when they picked up his younger brother, [[[SCP-590]]]. Given [[[SCP-963]]] to work with. Died. Came back. Has since been instrumental in work with several SCPs, and assisted in the refinement of many more.

**SCP Work:**
[[[SCP-963]]]
[[[SCP-590]]]
[[[SCP-719]]]
[[[SCP-720]]]
[[[SCP-721]]]

**To-Do List:**
Dr Rights
Die a lot. It's going to be fun.

Kubla Kahn, full poem.
Try and be useful.


**Additional Notes:** 
Dr. Bright is not allowed contact with any humanoid SCP not classified as Safe.

Dr. Bright is not allowed at site 17, ever.

Dr. Bright has proven highly resistant to psychic and emotional manipulation. Whether this is natural, or a function of 963, is both unknown, and untestable.

Jack acts as the unofficial bookie of the Foundation. If someone is betting on it, there's better then even chance that Doc is holding the books. We could shut him down, but it serves as a needed distraction for many of the researchers.

//O5 Note://Do not allow Dr. Bright to know, but several of his overwrites have been allowed to live, to work on special projects. Dr Brights 2-7 are assigned as follows [Data Redacted]
