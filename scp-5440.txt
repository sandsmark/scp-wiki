++++ **__Description__**
SCP-5440 was a phenomenon affecting a Scarlet Bush (//Hamelia patens//) located in the University of Florida's botanical garden. SCP-5440 caused the bush to spontaneously combust and remain burning for approximately two and a half hours. This process did no damage to the affected bush, nor the surrounding vegetation. During the duration of SCP-5440, a disembodied voice (designated SCP-5440-1) could be heard near the bush. SCP-5440-1 spoke in fluent English and was able to engage in conversation. The process that created the SCP-5440 phenomenon is currently unknown.

++++ **__Discovery__**
On 2020/04/21 at 9:45 AM GMT, SCP-5440 began and all attempts by campus staff to extinguish the fire were met with failure. At 10:00 AM, SCP-5440-1 began vocalizing the "Lord's prayer" and continued to do so repeatedly for one and a half hours. The Foundation became aware of SCP-5440 through rumors of a "talking bush", spread through UoF student's social media accounts. It was at this time that a Foundation containment team was dispatched to conceal and recover SCP-5440.

**Redfield:** I'm not– My name is Victor, I'm definitely not anybody's "god".

**SCP-5440-1:** V-Victor? I don't understand, Lord. Have you not heard my prayers?

**Redfield:** What are you talking about?

**SCP-5440-1:** Please, I need help! My sister done gotten hurt, an' she ain't right. My pa, he ain't here, an' I don't rightly ken what needs doin'. Please... Victor.

**Redfield:** I can't help if I don't know where you are.

**SCP-5440-1:** I'm right here! Right in front of your bush, uh, you.

**Redfield:** Kid, I'm in fron–, where is the bush?

**SCP-5440-1:** Out back behind the house, of course.

**Redfield:** And //where// is your home?

**SCP-5440-1** We're stayin' in Hogtown, north side of the old Arredondo Grant. Least that's what pa's always sayin'. Please I ain't got ti–

**Redfield:** Arredondo? Is that Florida? What date is it, kid?

**SCP-5440-1:** Why does that– Uh, fourth ah August, the year of our... uh, 1832.

**Redfield:** Jesus. 

**SCP-5440-1:** Is he with you? He can surely save Annabelle!

**Redfield:** No, I.. Um, listen, kid, I don't know if I can help you. You're... Uh, really far away.

**SCP-5440-1:** Please, she's bleedin' real bad! I done tore one of ma's old sheets like I done see Doc Willems do, but I– I can't get it to stop!

**Redfield:** Shit... Um, I can– //might//, be able to help you. But you have to listen to me carefully.

//[**Redacted for Brevity:** Junior Specialist Redfield explains to SCP-5440, in detail, rudimentary wound care utilizing objects found within SCP-5440-1's residence. After 35 minutes, SCP-5440-1 successfully stitches and dresses the wound.]//

**SCP-5440-1:** I can't thank you enough, Victor, you done saved Annabelle!

**Redfield:** I don't know about that, kid, you did all the work; I just helped you along.

**SCP-5440-1:** Never you mind that, mister. I rightly ken I'm in your debt, now. How could I ever repay you?

**Redfield:** Well, now that you mention it. Can you tell me how you contacted me? 

**SCP-5440-1:** You don't know? I said the prayer, 'course. Jus' like Gran always said to.


**Redfield:** Could you tell me this prayer?

**SCP-5440-1:** I ain't seein' a reason not to, you done saved my sister. Gran done told it to me like this–

//[SCP-5440-1 begins speaking an unknown language[[footnote]]Foundation etymologists established the language has its roots in Spanish, Arabic, and Latin.[[/footnote]] for approximately two minutes, at which time SCP-5440 extinguishes and the anomalous phenomenon terminates.]//

Following this event, the bush affected by SCP-5440 was kept under surveillance for additional anomalous phenomena. After one week SCP-5440 was re-designated neutralized. Victor Redfield was reprimanded for improper interview protocol and placed on a one-week paid leave. Due to the nature of the incident, this disciplinary action will not be included on Victor Redfield's permanent record.

Attempts to recreate SCP-5440 using the incantation provided by SCP-5440-1 have met with failure. The Thaumaturgy Division's analysis revealed no adherent thaumaturgical value to the incantation, indicating an unknown factor or prerequisite must be required. Testing has been abandoned indefinitely.
