**__SYNOPSIS:__** SCP-4 is a tentatively unexplained, multisensory phenomenon affecting three current El Paso, Texas residents; Mr. Dale and Mrs. Judy ███████, as well as their 4-year-old son Michael Sebastian. Reports from reliable sources indicate that the aberration manifests as a series of sensory data, to follow, as stated in the consult's collected anecdotal evidence:
* **Auditory:** Reported by the family approximately 80% of the time. The ███████'s report hearing faint, droning auditory stimuli that begin without warning, and that are apt to increase in volume given time. The auditory signature is said to often be in close proximity to one of the family members (sometimes all three simultaneously), seemingly surrounding them. 
 * The sound has been described using descriptors such as “sneaking”, “creaking”, “groaning”, “rumbling”,  and “squeaking”, and the like. Of note, the sounds allegedly display differing characteristics depending on which family member experiences the most proximity to a given instance. 
 * The research team has well figured that the haunting may be adopting idiosyncrasies of each member of the family as a method of ontological parasitism, latching upon native qualities and thereby actualizing its ability to manifest and communicate, albeit rudimentarily.

* **Visual:** Rarely reported; contrary to other sensory involvements, the family members disagree amid each other as to whether or not anecdotal evidences regarding any accompanying visual stimuli are fabrications of the stressed mind.

* **Olfactory:** Noted approximately 60% of the time. There is no consensus regarding the odor(s), though all are described in unpleasant terms by the family and incite aversion.

* **Somatosensory/Etcetera:** Manifestations purportedly can be accompanied by tactile sensations, such as "dreadful" vibrations. Thermal discrepancies have been described in the wake of manifestations.

**__HISTORY:__** SCP-4 reputedly began in the year 1893 during the family's residence in Garland, Texas. The Foundation was contacted by a long-time consultant, Father Loedel (Saint Mary's on the Pines), after he attempted an exorcism on the ███████’s property. The ███████s had endured severe psychological stress as a result of the purported haunting, which prompted the empathy of Father Loedel after his procedure was seemingly unsuccessful in resolving the anomaly. 

A research team composed of Junior Researchers Nunes and Coutaux (masquerading as independent paranormal investigators) was dispatched as a result of Father Loedel's consult and was tasked with the collection of empirical data.

**__ANALYSIS:__**: Based on the preliminary data, it was first speculated by this team that the phenomenon was unique to the then-home of the couple, as it featured hallmarks typical of thaumaturgically-hexed domiciles. Occurrences were typically restricted to when the family was alone (unable to be supported by corroborating witnesses), arranged in specific, ritual-like configurations (such as sitting at the dinner table), or in the early hours of the morning, often startling them from sleep. Ill-intent was deemed likely, as the phenomenon affected all components of the family's lives, including but not limited to finances, socialization, and occupation. 

However, the couple informed Father Loedel, shortly after spontaneously relocating into a new home (El Paso) in attempt to flee the haunting, that the phenomenon had followed them and continued its influence. The family was educated via letter on the importance of remaining where they are for the purposes of research logistics, given that the anomaly was not structure-specific. 

The team will confiscate the family and deliver them to a Foundation facility for long-term housing upon confirming the anomaly.

**Reclassification as Explained:** Circa 1895

//Note: The following is a reproduction of the journal entry penned by Junior Researcher Nunes, by which the designation of Explained was proposed and later justified.//

__April 7th, 1885.[[footnote]]The first night of the team's arrival to the family's home.[[/footnote]] El Paso, Texas.__
We had just finished a gracious dinner and we were telling Ol’ Coot[[footnote]]A nickname in the Cajun dialect for the surname, here given fondly to Junior Researcher Coutax.[[/footnote]] how good the meal was that he had cooked for us all.

It was about that time that the gastrointestinal processes -- I assume resultant to the particular seasonings on the boudin[[footnote]]A Franco-Cajun style sausage.[[/footnote]] -- began to exert their effect on our senses. First came //very// hyperactive bowel sounds, audible without the need for a stethoscope, as the stomach and intestines surely grappled with the heat of the spicery. Flatulence, barely recognizable as such given its timbre, started with the child Michael but soon involved Mr. and Mrs. ███████ as well, erupting in the dining room and concussing the walls of the home. (Myself and Coot were resistant it seems -- I take it because we had been eating this sort of cuisine regularly in the preceding weeks. Coutax sure knows his food.)

When the situation began to involve our senses of smell, a patent embarrassment became our hosts and the circulation in their faces was well-boasted. It was at this moment — one I honestly would have been glad to have credited them the courtesy of leaving unspoken — that the entire family began to lay blame upon the anomaly we had dedicated our time and resources to. I asked plainly if the reporting was nothing more than the family’s inability to reconcile their obvious sense of propriety with the emission of their digestive gases. The family assured me that any production of the sort was due to fear of the actual anomaly. Coot and I then took our leave, and with no need for amiable excuses.

I do not exaggerate when I proclaim that the event was the most ghastly display of digestive humors ever witnessed by myself or my colleague. The flatulence persisted without end for entirely too long, the sound rendering us incapable of coherently-interpreted speech. The odor was simply and remarkably indubitable. 

After all this pursuit, this is no bonafide anomaly ("just hot air" remarks the Ol' Coot!), although I can see why the family was scared towards death itself.
[[/div]]

The postulation derived from the above account was soon confirmed to be the source of the reported phenomenon through additional visits to the home and further //in situ// testing.

After scoring poorly on several sensory tests (including the senses of hearing and smell), Father Loedel was honorably retired from the Foundation consultation database with respect to phenomena regarding these faculties at age 83.

The file for SCP-4 was re-opened for repopulation by a valid anomaly.

**Reclassification as Euclid:** 17th of September, 1973
[[collapsible show="+ Display Documentation" hide="- Hide Documentation"]]
The SCP-4 slot was again designated to what is thought to be a re-discovery of the phenomenon. Foundation diagnosticians submitted a formal request for anomalous evaluation after two sisters — PoI-4-1 (aged 31) and PoI-4-2 (aged 27), both unmarried — bearing the surname ███████ wrote to //Unsolved Diagnoses//[[footnote]]A Foundation-fronted television show developed and aired beginning in the 1970's, whereby civilians reported medical anomalies that were then investigated for possible classification, thereby crowd-sourcing and expediting discoveries.[[/footnote]] of a gastrointestinal malady that was described in similar terms to those previously documented, and bearing reminiscent features. 

The letter described gaseous discomfort and expulsions which perpetuated for an unnaturally long duration, and would reportedly evacuate sizable social gatherings, e.g. church services. Investigations revealed and confirmed the presence of anomalous components to the condition.

The following is a reproduction of SCP-4's description after being reinstated as a Euclid-class anomaly:

> **Description:** SCP-4 is a gastrointestinal anomaly wherein gaseous by-products of digestion feature a contagious quality. 
> 
> SCP-4 originates from descendants of one paternal phylogeny, namely those who can be directly traced from the lineage of Harold Jean ███████.[[footnote]]The earliest known records of the family's immigration to the United States begin at this individual. Prior records do not exist or have not yet been discovered. No individuals in addition to those currently under surveillance by the Foundation exist in census databases.[[/footnote]] However, approximately 85% of the populace show susceptibility to SCP-4[[footnote]]Testing suggests that SCP-4 is potentially transmissive to any biological life form that possesses a digestive system.[[/footnote]] and will perpetuate its effect when detected, either through the senses of hearing or olfaction. 
> 
> SCP-4 has the potential to cause a chain-reaction, given a sufficient concentration of susceptible individuals. Foundation risk management teams have deemed a Lifted-Veil Scenario occurring as a result of such an event unlikely. The longest observed reaction involved 83 individuals.
> 
> SCP-4's mechanism of action is unknown. Foundation geneticists have endorsed the likelihood of the anomaly being carried by an autosomal dominant allele (not sex-chromosome-linked).

Initial containment included the boarding of PoI-4-1 and -2 in Site-M16, a Foundation medical research facility and teaching hospital. Due to the relatively concealed and benign nature of the anomaly, as well as the manageable number of offending individuals, trials were conducted as the individuals were given mitigated freedom to walk the site, and mild amnestics if appropriate. It is from these trials involving unwitting Site-M16 personnel that the anomalous features of SCP-4 were observed in a controlled environment and confirmed.

Subsequent protocols were developed that prioritized approaches of minimal invasion and disproportionate restriction of freedoms. To this end, a group of compounds were developed by Foundation pharmaceuticals to chemically contain SCP-4 by suppressing different key messengers within neural pathways between the involved senses and the gastrointestinal system.

One of these compounds, 4-EUY, resulted in the neutralization of SCP-4 in PoI-1 and -2, as well as those who are otherwise affected by SCP-4's contagious qualities. Through poorly understood means, 4-EUY ceased the production of SCP-4 as well as reflexive yawning responses in treated individuals.[[footnote]]While this implies a non-anomalous mechanism of action underlying SCP-4, the primacy of any proposed theory was never agreed upon, and reclassification to "Explained" could not be sufficiently justified.[[/footnote]]
