Lord Goran is a massive demonic entity who once lead the brutes of the Scarlet King's still-growing army.[[footnote]] Its growth based on our recent observations have seem to slow down since Lord Goran's absence. [[/footnote]] Lord Goran was known for his brutal, relentless assaults on lesser enemies of the Scarlet King, and it seemed no one was his equal until his mindlessness led to his fall.

Now he is imprisoned and awaits the day he may return to lead the Scarlet Hordes once again in destroying Creation.

**Knowledge**
[[/=]]

**Traits:** Lord Goran is stated to be of massive size, though no exact measurements have been found.[[footnote]] "I doubt anyone would care to know exactly how many meters or whatever the guy was. No one wanted to stick around after catching a small glimpse of him. Besides that, there heave been height comparisons such as a seven-story building. Overall, who cares? We are not Jailers." -Trünan [[/footnote]] Around his body he is engulfed in smoke and flames, which obscure most details of his form. He has four crimson-colored eyes and his skin is black and leathery.[[footnote]] "I heard it was rocky. Like as if he had barnacle growing on him. I don't recall the source where I read that." -Kunj [[/footnote]] [[footnote]] "I know where you got that notion, Kunj. It came from an entry of //Testimonies of Forgotten Battles Below Heaven Vol. II//, which isn't reliable. The person who described that detail was very anti-Scarlet King, and was indeed trying to say it looked like barnacle. It was an insult that spawn based on some bizarre whale analogy associated with the King. I will look into it for I think it's in //Derogatory Statements For Those Below Us//." - M. [[/footnote]]

In hand he would carry a club or a long sword, which is often subject to debate.[[footnote]] "It is likely he switched weapons for some conquests. I don't understand the fuss. I also heard he carries both! Overall, it is just pathetic bickering." - Trünan [[/footnote]]

**Nature:** Goran is near-mindless in his pursuit of destruction, though he maintains a moderate level of sapience. He is described to never speak[[footnote]] It is unclear if he refuses to or cannot. [[/footnote]] and always complied with the Scarlet King's wishes.

He is ruthless and nearly invincible. Most beings and weapons barely manage in combat against him. One or two blows from Goran is enough for most to perish.

It is not known how long Goran has existed, or his true origin. It is likely he is a primordial creature, though there is no evidence prove this.

**History & Associated Parties:** Lord Goran was not always called a lord until joining the Scarlet King during his rise to power. It is not known what Goran had done before the King, but speculation has deemed he likely was roaming the bottom of the Great Abyss.[[footnote]] See Library source on the [http://www.scp-wiki.net/the-maker-and-the-beast Great Abyss]. [[/footnote]] The reason why he would be within the Great Abyss is unknown, and the claim is to be taken lightly.

Under the Scarlet King's service, Lord Goran was involved in the conquest of 48 realms.[[footnote]] What we managed to confirm. [[/footnote]] He became favored by the Scarlet King, and was considered to posses authority of all forces. This favoritism would often lead to disputes among other lords, especially of those who favored different tactics than Goran.

At an unknown time, Lord Goran became imprisoned when attempting to conquer a universe already subjugated by an Archon of Yaldabaoth.[[footnote]] Please view the S category for Sarkicism for data regarding Yaldabaoth and her Six Archons. [[/footnote]] [[footnote]] "Wouldn't it be under N for Nälkä as well? I found some text under N. Maybe it was just the grouchy old timers that placed them there. " - Kunj [[/footnote]] This enraged the Archon who battled and defeated Lord Goran after an hour. The Archon brought Goran by the horns to the Scarlet King, and demanded why his lord attempted to violate the Treaty of Thorns and Flesh.[[footnote]] A treaty forged before Yaldabaoth's imprisonment where universes conquered or targeted by her or the Scarlet King are off-limits to each other. This treaty was mainly for the benefit of the Scarlet King for Yaldabaoth surpasses him in power. The last thing he wanted was to anger his aunt. For further information regarding the treaty please seek Library services.[[/footnote]]

The Scarlet King apologized and explained Goran acted alone. To make amends, he punished Lord Goran by banishing him to an unknown plane of existence of little interest[[footnote]] Most mainly speculate it to be somewhere in the Outer Realms. [[/footnote]] to be imprisoned for an indefinite time until needed. His current status is unknown.

**Approach:** Goran is to remain imprisoned for he is a threat like all beneath the Scarlet King. Efforts are being made to track his location, and develop measures to keep him there. Currently, it is speculated that the plane of existence may be accessible via a lone Way, which the Scarlet King used to send Goran. If such a Way exists then collapsing it would be an easy solution.

**Observations & Stories**
[[/=]]

//"On a distant hill, I watched the towers of my kingdom fall. I watched the many buildings burn. My kingdom of bronze and silver collapsed beneath a Colossus of Fire[[footnote]] An uncommon alternative name for Lord Goran. [[/footnote]] who waved a flag bearing a Scarlet seal. Those who could not flee, were taken as prisoners destined for a fate worse than death; sold into slavery under [http://www.scp-wiki.net/factory-hub wicked machines of industry].//

//"As the sky became engulfed in smoke, I collapsed and wept, my rotors humming. 'I failed my people.' I whispered to Mekhane."//

- Excerpt from //A Memoir of the Years of Broken Metal//

//"For twenty days and nights, the Horned Brute laid endless waves of screeching horrors at our gates. As we kept them at bay, he struck at the barrier and on the third hit it shattered. Our Saints, in the name of the Father, ordered our retreat as the Brute sent forth the Deathless[[footnote]] The Deathless is believed to refer to the children of the Scarlet King's fourth bride, A'zieb.[[/footnote]] while the rest of his forces remained outside.//

//"We evacuated through hidden Ways[[footnote]] "They were destroyed, of course." - M [[/footnote]] far below the city, but I could still hear the accursed war drums above throughout the journey."//

**Doubt**
[[/=]]

It has been heavily speculated that Lord Goran never had attacked the realm under Yaldabaoth's domain. Some point out that Goran only acts upon the Scarlet King's command so it would be unlike Goran. Some propose that:
* Goran was set up by other lords. They would have a motive due to him likely to acquire supreme control over them at the time. Also, some lords are direct spawn of the Scarlet King (through his first bride), which could lead to envy.[[footnote]] "They now know how their other siblings felt. Privileged brats." - Trünan [[/footnote]]
* The Archon lied and a conspiracy is under way. This claim is entirely baseless, and deemed incredibly unlikely. It states that the Archons are planning to trigger a war against the Scarlet King, and wanted to remove Goran to weaken his army. This is deemed unlikely due to the fact the Archons have not acted against any other lords. Also they possess greater capabilities and can easily destroy the Scarlet King's army together without using their assets.[[footnote]] "I somewhat agree for it sounds off. I don't agree exactly that they could defeat the King's army just themselves but whatever. Speculation is speculation." -M [[/footnote]]

Another doubt brought forth is that maybe he is not imprisoned or he does not exist. The latter statement is flawed due to countless testimonies from soldiers.

"//I'd like to propose something. Isn't it strange the King never summoned him to be used? What is he waiting for? Is something wrong with Goran? Hear me out, what if the King killed him? He could have just said he imprisoned him to possibly prevent outrage among his soldiers. Makes sense, no?//" - Kunj

"//Hmm. I don't think so due to how valuable Goran is, and due to how the King keeps everyone in line. I would keep it in mind though for that is suspicious. It could have to do with him forgetting about Goran due to other matters, since he does have a lot of stuff on his plate.//" -M
