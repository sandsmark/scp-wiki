**Item #:** SCP-4126

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4126 is to be neatly folded and stored in  a standard anomalous object storage container. --When sentience is gained, the object is allowed to roam the facility under supervision of at least one Foundation personnel.-- Due to concerns of the security precautions regarding its permission to roam the facility freely, the object has been restricted to Light Containment Zone, and may only roam for 2/3 of the time in which it maintains sentience. At least one Level-2 Foundation personnel must supervise SCP-4126-B and keep count of the time. When its roaming period has expired, SCP-4126-B is to be instructed to return to its containment chamber (See Addendum 4126-2). This does not apply to the exceptions of its “haunting cycle” such as the week leading up to Halloween (See paragraph five of Description for more information). In the rare event in which SCP-4126-B refuses to comply with the commands of personnel, Halloween-themed candy, such as candy corn or bars of milk chocolate, are to be retrieved and used as a form of bait or bribe. A pea-sized tracking device has been applied in the event that SCP-4126-A is taken without proper permission or warning. Dr. █████, the researcher who discovered SCP-4126, was voluntarily put in charge of supervising SCP-4126-B.

**Description:** SCP-4126 is a standard white bedsheet for a king sized mattress. The bedsheet does not have a tag or brand name on it. On the center of the sheet are two equally-sized and parallel holes cut neatly into the sheet. Closer inspection shows no form of damage or wear. However, being within 0.914 meters (3 feet) of the object can cause problems with radio frequencies, specifically that of cellular devices and any form of radio. This can be compared to the rumor that ghosts, if they exist, interfere with radar and radio signals.

The object lays mostly completely still as a bedsheet in its “resting” form, or SCP-4126-A. However, the bedsheet will occasionally rise on its own, as if being put on by someone, and will begin to manifest the abilities of a stereotypical ghost. This includes, but not limits to, being able to phase through physical matter (see Addendum 4126-4 for information on the exception to this rule), having an echo-y voice, and trying to catch humans by surprise by shouting “boo”. This state is classified as SCP-4126-B, or its "haunting" form. Looking under the sheet reveals nothing; no human, entity, or any form of organism, living or dead. All you see is the bottom of the sheet.

In its “haunting” form, as the objects prefers to call it, the object seems to have a similar voice to that of a 22-year-old male human, and has an IQ estimate of average intelligence for that age. The object is completely sentient, and displays all normal human traits. The object enjoys “messing around” with Foundation personnel by attempting to “spook” them by shouting “boo” after appearing from the ground, ceiling, or surrounding walls. The objects rarely takes anything seriously, and can barely even comprehend seriousness (See Addendum 4126-1 for more information). In this form, the object becomes almost completely incorporeal and is no longer affected by any laws of physics. This includes its ability to effortlessly phase through almost all forms of physical matter (See Addendum 4126-4 for the exception to this statement) and lack of gravitational pull on the sheet, allowing it go float upside down without folding in on itself. It locomotes via levitation which has been made possible by its incorporeal nature. The propulsion/pull that allows SCP-4126-B to move without any known limbs, wings, or other appendages required for movement has yet to be explain, and all theories regarding this have proven to be either ridiculous or false. Although being unable to collide with most physical matter, the object seems to have the ability to allow any living organism to touch it. By what has been viewed, it only grants this to individuals who it can trust, such as Dr. █████, the supervisor and discoverer of the object. Only seven known Foundation personnel besides Dr. █████ have been granted this ability.

When not trying to “spook” Foundation personnel, SCP-4126-B is generally compliant and very polite. Some personnel have taken to visiting it just to talk. For this reason, the Site Director has decided to allow all personnel with Level-1+ Clearance to visit and/or communicate with SCP-4126-B. However, SCP-4126 only stays in this form for up to twelve hours a day (See paragraph five of Description for more details), then turns back into SCP-4126-A, or its “resting” form. --It is to be located and folded neatly in its containment chamber after this change.-- As a result of the new security protocols set in place (See Special Containment Procedures for more information), SCP-4126-A can now easily be located. When becoming aware of the object’s change of form, whether it be visually or from approximated time span of sentience, the designated supervisor of SCP-4126-B is to report to SCP-4126’s containment chamber, neatly fold it, and place it in its designated area. Level-2+ Clearance is required to access SCP-4126-A, and all tests must be approved by at least one Senior Researcher or higher. If testing involves any number of Class-D Personnel, the test must be approved by personnel with Level-4+ Clearance, and must take as many Security Officers as required for an escort.

The time span in which it stays in its “haunting” form, or SCP-4126-B, depends on the current Moon phase in the lunar cycle, current holiday, and/or time of day. By default, SCP-4126 is most active at night, but is sometimes found in its “haunting” form in the middle of the day. If the moon cycle is drawing closer to a full moon, SCP-4126 becomes more active by the hour, and less active by the hour when drawing closer to a new moon. When it is a full moon, SCP-4126 remains in its “haunting” form for the full twelve-hour timespan; on the contrary, SCP-4126 remains in its “resting” form for the whole day on a new moon. The only exceptions to this “haunting cycle” are Halloween and All Saints Day. For the week leading up to Halloween, SCP-4126 will remain in its “haunting” form without end. It will also show immense joy and celebrate the holiday in a few different ways (see Addendum 4126-3). On All Saints Day, the day after Halloween, the object will remain in its “resting” form for the entire day. These two circumstances are not affected by the “haunting cycle” in any way. After these eight days, the “haunting cycle” once again takes effect until the week leading up to Halloween one year later. This has happened every year with no change in activity or dates in which activities occur.

SCP-4126 was discovered when the bedsheet of Dr. █████ from Site 12 started talking to him as he slept. He would wake up and imagine that it was simply a figment of his imagination, until the bedsheet spoke to him while he was conscious, begging him to pull it off of the mattress. The object was soon after brought upon the Foundation’s attention and given an SCP classification. --It is possible that, if applied to a mattress, SCP-4126-B is rendered completely immobile whilst maintaining sentience and cognitive functions. Testing on the matter will be done in the future, though made difficult due to the randomness of the times in which SCP-4126 changes its form.-- (See Addendum 4126-4 for results on testing with matresses.)


**Addendum 4126-1:** 

An interview was being conducted on SCP-4126-B to obtain a basic understanding of its sentience. The interview did not go as planned.
> **Interviewed:** SCP-4126-B
> 
> **Interviewer:** Dr. ███
> 
>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
> 
> **<Begin Log>**
> 
> **Dr. ███:** SCP-4126-B, would you mind if I asked you a few questions?
> 
> **SCP-4126-B:** Of course not, my man! What's up?
> 
> **Dr. ███:** How long have you been sentient?
> 
> **SCP-4126-B:** Heh, nope. That's like asking if I remember being born. Do //you//?
> 
> Dr. ███ begins to write down a few notes.
> 
> **SCP-4126-B:** Hey, what's that on your shoulder?
> 
> Dr. ███ looks at his shoulder and back, only to see that SCP-4126-B was gone. It had decided to sneak up behind him to shout “boo”, surprising Dr. ███ and causing him to flinch. SCP-4126-B returns to its side of the table, laughing.
> 
> **Dr. ███:** Okay, you had your fun. Let’s move on. Now, have you ever-
> 
> **SCP-4126-B:** (Interrupting Dr. ███) Hey, there's a mustard stain on your shirt.
> 
> Dr. ███ looks down at his shirt, only to be surprised by SCP-4126-B, who caught him by surprise after quickly emerging from the floor where his feet lay, catching Dr. ███ once again by surprise. SCP-4126 once again returns to its original position, laughing.
> 
> **Dr. ███:** SCP-4126-B, that is quite enough. Please, just answer my questions so we can make this shorter than it has to be-
> 
> **SCP-4126-B:** There's a bee above your head!
> 
> Dr. ███ looks up only to see SCP-4126-B looking down at him from above his head.
> 
> **Dr. ███:** This interview is over.
> 
> **<End Log>**
> 
> **Closing Statement:** SCP-4126-B seems to have little-to-no understanding of when serious behavior is required. It has not a care in the world, and simply wants to make people jump from their seats with its shenanigans. However, there’s something so oddly... likable about it. It could be its polite attitude or hearty (no pun intended) personality. Although it frustrates myself and other personnel at times, I have a feeling that we will soon enjoy its company.


**Addendum 4126-2:** 

SCP-4126-B does not try to leave the facility on purpose. Rather, similarly to [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-343 SCP-343], it chooses to stay within its confines. It once drifted to the surface out of curiosity, where is was quickly discovered and escorted back to the facility through use of Halloween-based candy. Since then, SCP-4126-B must stay within the supervision of at least one Foundation personnel at all times, and is only permitted to roam within Light Containment Zone. The object must also be returned to its containment chamber after a certain time depending on the phase of the moon in the lunar cycle. This does not apply to the exceptions of its “haunting cycle”, such as the week leading up to Halloween (See paragraph five of Description for more information).

**Addendum 4126-3:**

SCP-4126-B was observed to experience a behavioral change in the week leading up to Halloween. Its behavioral changes can be categorized in three stages; the first three lasting two days, while the fourth only one day. Each stage overlaps each other, with the final stage being a sort of “grand finale”. The following are the four stages of the behavioral changes:

__Stage 1: Candy__
Exactly seven days before Halloween, SCP-4126-B was seen to always be in its “haunting” form and be particularly joyful. In addition, it would start to give out candy to some on-Site personnel. This candy includes chocolate, gummy candy, and lollipops. It seems to drop out from the head area of SCP-4162-B and through the gap at the bottom. All candy given by SCP-4126-B has a Halloween theme, such as candies being shaped like pumpkins and wrapping with orange and black color schemes. This candy is completely normal with no potential anomalous health risks or anomalous properties. For this reason, all personnel who are given candy by SCP-4126-B are permitted to eat said candy, but must report any anomalous effects. To this point in time, no instances of anomalous occurrences regarding consumption of the candy have been reported.

__Stage 2: Decorations__
Two days after Stage One, SCP-4126-B will begin to hang up Halloween-themed decorations across the facility when no one is present. These decorations include Jack-o-Lanterns, rubber bats that are tied to strings, skeletons, Halloween banners, and black/orange balloons tied to stairways and tables. Whenever SCP-4126-B starts decorating, all nearby cameras turn to static for a limited time. The static ends approximately three minutes after cutting out, which is how long it takes for the decorating to end. It only does so when there are no personnel within the room, and any personnel intruding on the decorating stage are simply asked politely by the object to come back in a few minutes. It is unknown where SCP-4126-B gets access to all of these decorations, but, similar to its candy, they have no anomalous properties or effects. To this day, no anomalies have been reported about these decorations, either.

__Stage 3: Encouragement__
Another two days after Stage Two, Halloween-themes music will begin to play across the PA system at random times. This happens once per day, typically after 6:00 PM. The songs vary from //Thriller// to //Monster Mash// and have no pattern or way of predicting the next song. The object also starts to encourage all personnel to dress up for every Halloween. Ever since SCP-4126 has been contained, more and more personnel have been celebrating the season with costumes. At the time of this addendum being recorded, approximately 75% of the on-site personnel who have met SCP-4126-B have worn costumes to celebrate.

__Stage 4: The Monster Mash__
On the day of Halloween, Halloween music will play over the PA from 6:00 PM to 10:00 PM with a five-minute intermission between songs. SCP-4126-B will start setting up some sort of social gathering, which is referred to “The Monster Mash” by the item, in a main area of socialization-typically the Cafeteria in Light Containment Zone. These preparations include even more decorations, food, drinks, and candy. It is encouraged by the Site Director to attend the party if possible, though it is not a mandatory event. Personnel who consume any of the food or drink in said party start to feel a small sensation of joy that lasts up to ten minutes after consumption. The object acts as a form of overseer of the social gathering, trying its hardest to make sure that all "guests" are happy and enjoying themselves while keeping a watchful eye out. At exactly 10:00 PM, all music over the PA ceases and the the party officially ends, and all personnel are instructed to leave by the object. It does so in a calm but firm tone, and does so until all personnel vacate the premises of the social gathering.

__Aftermath__
By morning, personnel report that the area of the party and all decorated rooms have been fully reverted; no decorations, candy, or other objects from SCP-4126-B remaining. SCP-4126-A will soon be found neatly folded in its containment chamber without any explanation as to who returned it or how it was returned. Above the door that leads to its containment will be one final banner that reads “Happy Halloween!” in orange/black text. Happy Halloween, indeed.

**Addendum 4126-4:** 

As previously stated in paragraph six of Description, theories were being made regarding SCP-4126 and matresses. it was theorized that SCP-4126 is rendered completely immobile when applied to a properly-sized mattress for the object, or a king sized mattress to be specific. the test can be seen below:
> __**Test 4126-1 - 24/9/██__
> > Subject:** SCP-4126
> > **Procedure:** SCP-4126-A was applied to three different king sized matresses in three separate days to see if the theories on its reaction to mattresses are true. Rather than physically observing the test, cameras were used in order to save time.
> > **Results:** For all three mattresses, SCP-4126-b showed the same result; being unable to move in the slightest while begging in a scared and confused tone of voice for someone to "release" it.
> > **Analysis:** This test proves all theories of SCP-4126 and mattresses to be true- applying SCP-4126 to a mattress causes it so be completely immobile while maintaining sentience. It also appears that mattresses are the only form of physical matter that SCP-4126 cannot/refuses to phase through. This newly-gained information will be useful in development of future containment methods for the object.
> **__Personal Notes:__** Watching SCP-4126-B suffer in such a way was very disheartening, to say the least. I don't think I can forget about this...
>> **__Editor Notes:__** Dr. ██████ was later administered Class-C Amnestics after feeling prolonged guilt in his actions. As for SCP-4126-B, it seems to have either forgotten all about the test, or has chosen to forget. Either way, it does not seem to care, and has returned to its previously hearty and lively (once again, no pun intended) state of being.
