**Item #:** SCP-4126

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4126 is to be neatly folded and stored in  a standard anomalous object storage container. --When sentience is gained, the object is allowed to roam the facility under supervision of at least one Foundation personnel.-- Due to concerns of the security precautions regarding its permission to roam the facility freely, the object has been instructed to remain in Light Containment Zone, and may only roam for 2/3 of the time in which it maintains sentience. At least one Level-2 Foundation personnel must supervise SCP-4126-B and keep count of the time. When the time is up, SCP-4126-B is to be instructed to return to its cell (See Addendum 4126-2). This does not apply to the exceptions of its “haunting cycle” such as the week leading up to Halloween (See paragraph five of the Description for more information).

**Description:** SCP-4126 is a standard white bedsheet for a king sized mattress. The bedsheet seems to have no tag or brand on it. On the center of the sheet are two equally-sized and parallel holes cut neatly into the sheet. Closer inspections show no form of damage or wear. However, being within 0.914 meters (3 feet) of the object can cause problems with radio frequencies, specifically that of cellular devices and any form of radio. This can be compared to the rumor that ghosts, if they exist, interfere with radar and radio signals.

The object lays mostly completely still as a bedsheet, or SCP-4126-A. However, the bedsheet will occasionally rise on its own, as if being put on by someone, and will begin to manifest the abilities of a stereotypical ghost. This includes, but not limits to, being able to phase through physical matter (but only when it wants to), having an echo-y voice, and trying to catch humans by surprise by shouting “boo”. This state is classified as SCP-4126-B, or its "haunting" form. Looking under the sheet reveals nothing; no person, entity, or any form of creature, living or dead. All you see is the bottom of the sheet.

In its “haunting” form, as the objects prefers to call it, the object seems to have a similar voice to that of a 22-year-old male human, and has an average IQ estimate for that age. The object is completely sentient, and displays all normal human traits. The object enjoys “messing around” with Foundation personnel by attempting to “spook” them by shouting “Boo!” after appearing from the ground, ceiling, or surrounding walls. The objects rarely takes anything seriously, and can barely even comprehend seriousness (see Addendum 4126-1).

When not trying to “spook” Foundation personnel, SCP-4126-B is generally compliant and very polite. Some personnel have taken to visiting it just to talk. For this reason, the Site Director has decided to allow all personnel with Level-1+ Clearance are allowed to visit and/or communicate with SCP-4126-B. However, SCP-4126 only stays in this form for up to twelve hours a day (see below for more details), then turns back into SCP-4126-A, or it “resting” form. It is to be located and folded neatly in its containment chamber after this change. Level-2+ Clearance is required to access SCP-4126-A.

The timespan in which it stays in its “haunting” form, or SCP-4126-B, depends on the cycle of the moon, current holiday, and/or time of day. By default, SCP-4126 is most active at night, but is sometimes found in its “haunting” form in the middle of the day. If the moon cycle is drawing closer to a full moon, SCP-4126 becomes more active by the hour, and less active by the hour when drawing closer to a new moon. When it is a full moon, SCP-4126 remains in its “haunting” form for the full twelve-hour timespan; on the contrary, SCP-4126 remains in its “resting” form for the whole day on a new moon. The only exceptions to this “haunting cycle” are Halloween and All Saints Day. For the week leading up to Halloween, SCP-4126 will remain in its “haunting” form without end. It will also show immense joy and celebrate the holiday in a few different ways (see Addendum 4126-3). On All Saints Day, the day after Halloween, the object will remain in its “resting” form for the entire day. These two circumstances are not affected by the “haunting cycle” in any way. After these eight days, the “haunting cycle” once again takes effect until the week before next Halloween.

SCP-4126 was discovered when the bedsheet of Dr. █████ of Site-12 started talking to him as he slept. He would wake up and imagine that it was simply him dreaming, until the bedsheet spoke to him, begging him to get it pulled off of the mattress. The object was soon after brought upon the Foundation, and was given an SCP classification. It is possible that, if applied to a mattress, SCP-4126-B is rendered completely immobile whilst maintaining sentience and cognitive functions. Testing on the matter will be done in the future, though made difficult due to the randomness of the times in which SCP-4126 changes its form.


**Addendum 4126-1:** 

An interview was being conducted on SCP-4126-B to have a general understanding of its sentience. The interview did not go as planned.

> 
> **SCP-4126-B:** Of course, my man! What's up?
> 
> **Dr. ███:** How long have you been sentient?
> 
> **SCP-4126-B:** That's like asking if I remember being born. Do //you//?

> **SCP-4126-B:** Hey, what's that on your shoulder?
> 
> Dr. ███ looks at his shoulder and back, only to see that SCP-4126-B was gone. It had decided to sneak up behind him to let out a loud “boo”, making Dr. ███ jump. SCP-4126-B returns to its side of the table, laughing.

> **Dr. ███:** Okay, you had your fun. Now, have you ever-

> **SCP-4126-B:** (Interrupting Dr. ███) Hey, there's a mustard stain on your shirt.

> Dr. ███ looks down at his shirt, only to be surprised by SCP-4126-B, who jumped at him after quickly emerging from the floor where his feet lay, causing Dr. ███ once again to jump. SCP-4126 once again returns to his original position, laughing.
> 
> **Dr. ███:** SCP-4126-B, please comply. Just answer my questions so we can make this shorter than it has to be-

> **SCP-4126-B:** There's a bee above your head!

> Dr. ███ looks up, only to see SCP-4126-B floating above him, looking down at him.
> 
> **Dr. ███:** This interview is over.
> 
> **<End Log>**
> 
> **Closing Statement:** SCP-4126-B seems to have little-to-no understanding of when serious behavior is required. It has not a care in the world, and simply wants to make people jump from their seats with its shenanigans. However, there’s something so oddly... like-able about it. It could be its pranks or its hearty spirit (no pun intended). Although it frustrates other staff and me, I have a feeling that we will soon enjoy its company.


**Addendum 4126-2:** 

SCP-4126-B does not try to leave the facility on purpose. Rather, similar to SCP-343, it chooses to stay within its confines. It once drifted to the surface out of curiosity, where is was quickly escorted back to the facility by use of Halloween-based candy. Since then, SCP-4126-B must stay within the supervision of at least one Foundation personnel at all times if possible, and is only permitted to roam around Light Containment Zone. The object must also be returned to its containment chamber after a certain time depending on the cycle of the moon. This does not apply to the exceptions of its “haunting cycle”, such as the week leading up to Halloween (See paragraph five of the Description for more information).

**Addendum 4126-3:**

SCP-4126-B observed to have a behavioral change in the week leading up to Halloween. Its behavioral changes can be categorized in three stages; the first three lasting two days, while the fourth only one day. Each stage overlaps each other, with the final stage being the climax of the changes. The following are the four stages of the behavioral change:

__Stage 1: Candy__
Exactly seven days before Halloween, SCP-4126-B was seen to always be in its “haunting” form and be particularly joyful. In addition, it would start to give out candy to some on-Site personnel. This candy includes chocolate, gummy candy, and lollipops. It seems to drop out from the head area of SCP-4162-B and through the gap at the bottom. All candy given by SCP-4126-B has a Halloween theme, such as candies being shaped like pumpkins and wrapping with orange and black color schemes. This candy is completely normal with no potential anomalous health risks or anomalous properties. For this reason, all personnel who are given candy by SCP-4126-B are permitted to eat said candy, but must report any anomalous effects. To this point in time, no instances of anomalous occurrences regarding consumption of the candy have been reported.

__Stage 2: Decorations__
Two days after Stage One, SCP-4126-B will begin to hang up Halloween-themed decorations across the facility when no one is present. These decorations include Jack-o-Lanterns, rubber bats that are tied to strings, skeletons, Halloween banners, and black/orange balloons tied to stairways and tables. Whenever SCP-4126-B starts decorating, all nearby cameras turn to static for a limited time. The static ends approximately three minutes after cutting out, which is how long it takes for the decorating to end. It only does so when there are no personnel within the room, and any personnel intruding on the decorating stage are simply asked politely by the object to come back in a few minutes. It is unknown where SCP-4126-B gets access to all of these decorations, but, similar to its candy, they have no anomalous properties or effects. To this day, no anomalies have been reported about these decorations, either.

__Stage 3: Encouragement__
Another two days after Stage Two, Halloween-themes music will begin to play across the PA system at random times. This happens once per day, typically after 6:00 PM. The songs vary from //Thriller// to //Monster Mash// with no pattern or way of predicting the next song. The object also starts to encourage all personnel to dress up for every Halloween. Ever since SCP-4126 has been contained, more and more personnel have been celebrating the season with costumes. At the time of this addendum being recorded, approximately 75% of the on-site personnel who have met SCP-4126-B have worn costumes to celebrate.

__Stage 4: The Monster Mash__
On the day of Halloween, Halloween music will play over the PA from 6:00 PM to 10:00 PM with a 2-minute break between songs. SCP-4126-B will start setting up some sort of social gathering, or “The Monster Mash” as it is called by the item, in a main area of socialization, typically the Cafeteria in Light Containment Zone. These preparations include even more decorations, food, drinks, and candy. It is encouraged by the Site Director to attend the party if possible, though it is not a mandatory event. Personnel who consume any of the food or drink in said party start to feel a small sensation of joy that lasts up to 10 minutes after consumption. The object acts as a form of overseer of the social gathering, trying its hardest to make sure that all "guests" are happy and enjoying themselves while keeping a watchful eye out. At exactly 10:00 PM, all music over the PA ceases and the the party officially ends, and all personnel are instructed to leave by the object. It does so in a calm but firm tone, and does so until all personnel vacate the premises of the social gathering.

__Aftermath__
By morning, personnel report that the area of the party and all decorated rooms have been fully reverted; no decorations, candy, or other objects from SCP-4126-B remaining. SCP-4126-A will soon be found neatly folded in its containment chamber without any explanation as to who returned it or how it was returned. Above the door that leads to its containment will be one final banner that reads “Happy Halloween!” in orange/black text. Happy Halloween, indeed.
