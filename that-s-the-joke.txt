//I know the thaumaturgists already told us that it wouldn't be susceptible to targeted metaexposure, but I still maintain that it was worth a shot. I didn't even need to use the whole page.//- Researcher James, age 8.

> __00:00:__ Test commences. Subject instructed to initiate stated protocols.
> 
> __00:14:__ Subject reports gastrointestinal distress. KTE-8544-Porcelain produces characteristic vocalization.
> 
> __00:23:__ KTE-8544-Porcelain attempts to replicate via subject's posterior, but is hindered by testing protocols.
> 
> __03:19:__ Subject ceases testing protocols. KTE-8544-Porcelain observed to be subdued, but active. Subject instructed to remain on toilet in case protocols must be resumed.
> 
> __03:41:__ <CLASSIFIED> due to subject's unusually small frame and an oversight in toilet selection.
> 
> __04:19:__ <CLASSIFIED>

//I would have sworn that those cafeteria burritos would do the trick. Here's hoping they can get the guy a new butt.//- Researcher James.

Researcher James was instructed to interview KTE-8544-Porcelain to ascertain information that could assist in the entity's liquidation.
> //Researcher James is seen pacing the restroom. Camera focused on KTE-8544-Porcelain shows the entity in its toilet. Scene is dramatic.//
> 
> __<Begin Interview>__
> 
> __Researcher James:__ So. KTE eight five four four porcelain. If that //is// your real name. Who are you?
> 
> __KTE-8544-Porcelain:__ i am the butt ghost!!
> 
> __RJ:__ And why should I believe you? //<Slams his hands on the toilet seat and presumably glares at the butt ghost in a threatening manner.>//
> 
> __BG:__ im going to eat your butt
> 
> __RJ:__ How bizarre. //<Stands up from the toilet seat and accesses a plastic baggie of Goldfish crackers.>// Why do you eat our butts, butt ghost? Butts do not equal love, you know.
> 
> __BG:__ ffft fart poot poop phbbbt
> 
> __RJ:__ //<Chews on Goldfish crackers like a hard-boiled detective would chew on a cigar.>// Fascinating, truly fascinating. You know, despite your rather... prolific history of gluteocidal self-replication, you seem to be a solitary creature. Mind telling me why?
> 
> __BG:__ //<makes more hilarius farting noises>//
> 
> __RJ:__ But of course. It would only make sense, with you being a butt ghost. One last thing: //<Looks the butt ghost dead in the eye with a chilling stare.>// Wiping. Why does it get rid of you? //Where are the hostages?//
> 
> __BG:__ //<tries to eat jameses butt, butt he cant becus hes in the toilet and james isnt>// im a butt ghost
> 
> __RJ:__ //<Attempts to snap his fingers, but he hasn't quite gotten that down yet.>// It all makes sense now! What else could the moral of the story be? I've got all I need to go to the presses with this!
> 
> __<End Interview>__
> 
> __Closing statement:__ Researcher James was grounded --for unrelated reasons-- after the conclusion of this interview.

//He knows he's only allowed one snack in the afternoon. And by the way, we don't have to make him a Researcher just because only he can talk to it.//- Researcher James's Dad
