**Item #:** SCP-2026

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** Instances of SCP-2026 may be kept in a standard containment locker at Site-20. Instances of SCP-2026-1 must be kept in wooden boxes without lids in a containment cell at the same Site, so as to let the light in. Experiments involving SCP-2026 must have the approval of at least one Level 3 Researcher.

**Description:** SCP-2026 refers to a collection of mouthwash products. They are named on their packages as “Wilson & Wong’s Fun Size History”. Currently, 135 bottles are in the Foundation’s possession. Analysis of the chemical structures of the packages and the mouthwash itself reveals no anomalies. There are several flavors of SCP-2026.

SCP-2026’s anomalous properties will manifest when used by a human. Approximately 2 hours after using SCP-2026, a random tooth will fall out. It will be replaced by a new one after three days. Of note is that this effect only occurs if the individual also uses a toothbrush, toothpaste and dental floss. If not, the process will stop in the first few days. The fallen tooth will suffer a transformation over the following seven days. It will gradually be converted into a varying number of small, sapient human figures made out of the pulp and enamel. These figures (hereafter designated SCP-2026-1) will build structures out of the tooth. The nature of SCP-2026-1 and the structures depends on the flavor of the SCP-x bottle. Currently, 15 flavors have been identified. Ten of them correspond to a type of past human civilization, while the rest correspond to imaginary ones.

Instances of SCP-2026-1 are capable of speaking, writing and reading in their corresponding language. Instances of SCP-2026 will continue to build more structures out of any nearby solid materials, including plastic, concrete, steel, glass, paper and electronic devices. Living tissue is ignored by instances of SCP-2026-1. The only material encountered so far which is not converted by instances of SCP-2026-1 is wood, which can act as a barrier to stop their expansion.

Instances of SCP-2026-1 will act out the roles of common types of individuals from the corresponding civilization, such as merchants, workers, nobility, clergy, scientists and politicians. Reusing SCP-2026 will only result in the same effect after a waiting period of two months. Instances of SCP-2026-1 are incapable of perceiving humans. Should a human interact physically with an instance of SCP-2026-1, such as picking them up, they will usually interpret this as the act of a god. Introducing instances of SCP-2026-1 from one civilization to another has yielded varying results, from harmonious coexistence to constant warfare.
