**File Update <21/03/2014>:** The file for SCP-4375 can be found further down the page. This has been done due to the neutralization of SCP-4375 and the creation of SCP-4375-1. [[footnote]]See //Addendum 4375.1.//[[/footnote]]

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4375-1 is currently kept within the main containment unit of the second building of Specialized Containment And Research Site-4375-01. SCP-4375-1 is to be wearing a straitjacket and a bandage covering its eyes. It is to be strapped to its hospital bed where it is to be fed via IV Drip and is to be connected to an assigned generator via the YBOD-01 Device[[footnote]]See //Addendum 4375.5//[[/footnote]] in order to perpetuate containment. This device is to be in "Containment Mode" by default. Changing the active mode of the device requires majority approval from the O5 Council. 

Specialized Containment And Research Site-4375-01 has been outfitted with a total of 68 Scranton Reality Anchors in order to preserve the containment of SCP-4375-1, with 8 of these being located in and around the main containment unit of the second building, which is where SCP-4375-1 is contained. All persons are recommended to maintain a distance of at least 10m from SCP-4375-1, even when the anomaly is in containment, in order to avoid the effects of the anomaly. Should YBOD-01 device fail, malfunction or lose power, or should any other scenario possibly resulting in SCP-4375-1 breaching containment occur, the current site administrator of Specialized Containment And Research Site-4375-01 is to initiate a full site evacuation. 

Due to the YBOD-01 device, SCP-4375-1 is currently fully controlled by the Foundation. [[footnote]]See //Addendum 4375.5//[[/footnote]]

If the YBOD-01 device has been destroyed or damaged, resulting in SCP-4375-1 being able to use its anomalous abilities and move freely for an indefinite amount of time, the anomaly may be neutralized via sniper fire or ballistic missiles. 

[[include component:image-block name=west.png|align=right|width=250px|caption=Pvt. Aaron West prior to receiving SCP classification.]]

Level 3 researcher Dr. Adam Willow is not under any circumstances to come in contact with SCP-4375-1, any persons involved in its containment or any persons involved in the SCP-4375-1 Field Use Project. [[footnote]]See //Addendum 4375.3//[[/footnote]]


**Description:** SCP-4375-1 is a 24 year old human male of African American descent, formerly known as Private Aaron West, a former armed guard working for the SCP Foundation. SCP-4375-1 is, since Event-4375-04, a Class III Reality Bender with a Hume level of [http://www.scp-wiki.net/and-this-one-explains-humes 72/147], although its reality bending effects are not noticeable when the anomaly is in containment due to the the effects of the YBOD-01 Device.

Due to the effects of the YBOD-01 Device, SCP-4375-1 has forgotten all events that occurred prior to its containment, is suffering from major depressive disorder, and is blind due to blood poisoning caused by the device. Due to the mental state of SCP-4375-1 and its effect on its anomalous properties, SCP-4375-1 may manipulate its surroundings in completely unpredictable and often otherwise illogical or impossible ways if the YBOD-01 Device becomes inactive through any means. 

**Addendum 4375.1:** Event-4375-04

= **EVENT-4375-04 | <09/12/2013>**
-----
**Notes:** SCP-4375, which is currently neutralized, is a glade located in Northern Indiana, USA. Prior to Event-4375-04, SCP-4375 was a Safe-Class SCP that had the ability to allow persons standing on it to remember forgotten memories, even if these had been removed using amnestics. SCP-4375 also had a hume level somewhat higher than the standard level of its surroundings, although this did not alter the surroundings in any notable way. 

**Summary:** Event-4375-04 occurred when a Global Occult Coalition Aerial Vehicle flew over the site of SCP-4375 with neither any warning nor permission. The vehicle was not able to be destroyed and proceeded to bomb the anomaly, neutralizing SCP-4375, spreading a swarm of unidentified, presumably anomalous glowing spores into the air.

One armed guard, Aaron West, was apparently targeted by these and was struck by a large swarm of them. These spores seemingly had no anomalous effects on West. No other personnel were exposed to these spores.

The Global Occult Coalition has since denied its involvement in the event and the vehicle involved was never identified.

= **SCP-4375 FILE (OUTDATED) | <11/03/2012>**
-----
**Item #:** SCP-4375

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4375 is contained at its site of discovery. A border wall with a constant distance of approximately 5m from SCP-4375 has been set up around the anomaly. Security cameras have been placed on the wall, and the live feeds of these are to be monitored around the clock. In the event that an unauthorized person enters SCP-4375, they are to be detained and given Class A Amnestics before being escorted to their homes.

**Description:** SCP-4375 is a glade located in Northern Indiana, USA. The anomalous properties of SCP-4375 manifest once a person travels onto the glade. The person will immediately be informed of all of their previously lost memories simultaneously, even if these memories have been removed using amnestics or have been forgotten due to dementia or similar disorders. Amnestics can however be used with their intended effects on persons who have already been exposed to the anomalous effects of SCP-4375.

SCP-4375 also has a hume level of 76/107, although this does not in any notable way bend or manipulate the surrounding area. ^^1^^

The use of SCP-4375 to restore memories for eyewitness interviews and testimonies is only to be carried out with permission from at least one personnel with a Level 4 Clearance or higher. Unauthorized use of SCP-4375 will result in the amnesticization and relocation of the perpetrator. 

**Discovery:** SCP-4375 was discovered by level 3 researcher Dr. Adam Willow and armed guard Private Aaron West, who lived in the area at the time of discovery. 

[[size large]]**Footnotes:**[[/size]]

1. Due to this, it is theorized that SCP-4375 may originate from an Earth-like planet in an alternate universe, or that it may have been exposed to such a location through other means.

= **UA-038-POKG RECOVERY LOG TRANSCRIPT | <02/07/2014>**
-----
**Date:** 02/07/2014
**Recovery Team:** Mobile Task Force Pi-1 "City Slickers"
**Subject:** UA-038-POKG
**Team Lead:** P-1 4
**Team Members:** P-1 1, P-1 3, P-1 4, P-1 6, P-1 7, P-1 8, P-1 9

**Notes:** //Members of MTF Pi-1 "City Slickers" were sent to the apartment belonging to UA-038-POKG and Level 3 Researcher Dr. Adam Willow to retrieve both subjects.//

//The following log regards a "UA", or "Undocumented Anomaly". Therefore, the properties and abilities of the anomaly in question are not known yet.//

-----

**<Begin Log>**

**P-1 4:** We're ready, Command. Everyone, are your cameras on and are your mics working?

**P-1 7:** Check.

**P-1 3:** Testing.

**P-1 9:** Check.

**P-1 6:** Testing.

**P-1 1:** Check.

**P-1 8:** Check.


**Command:** Okay, Pi-1. You may exit the vehicle and enter the apartment building.

//MTF Pi-1 do as instructed, exiting the transport vehicle and approaching the building before unlocking the door using a code that was initially recovered from Dr. Willow's office. They walk up the stairs of the building, up to floor 2 where they stop at door 4 and assume breaching positions.//

**Command:** You may breach.

**P-1 4:** Okay, P-1 8. You kick the door down on my command. Me, you and P-1 9 find the UA while the others look through the apartment. Dr. Willow should be here as well, but the UA is our number one priority.

**P-1 8:** Roger that. Breaching on your command.

//P-1 4 nods towards P-1 8, who kicks the door in. MTF Pi-1 all make their way in, splitting up, leaving P-1 4, P-1 8 and P-1 9 alone as they move forward. They walk into what appears to be a living room, where UA-038-POKG can be seen sitting on the couch, seemingly aware of the presence of MTF Pi-1. P-1 4 puts the wrists of UA-038-POKG behind its back and ties them together using a zip tie.//

**P-1 4:** UA is detained. Now find Willow.

**P-1 9:** Roger that.

**P-1 1:** I've found Willow! He is attempting to escape! Researcher Adam Willow, stop running or you will be terminated!

//P-1 7 runs downstairs towards the now stopped Dr. Willow and puts the researcher's hands behind his back and applies zip ties to them. Shortly after, the apartment building appears to be pulled into itself, crushing all Pi-1 members except for P-1 7 before expanding to its previous size with no visible damage to the building. P-1 7 starts opening fire towards the balcony of the building as UA-038-POKG exits the building by climbing down from the balcony. All bullets fired at UA-038-POKG appear to disintegrate in mid air, resulting in no damage done to the anomaly.//

//UA-038-POKG walks towards P-1 7 slowly as P-1 7 fires at it. All weapons belonging to P-1 7 are then disintegrated and P-1 7 is lifted off of the ground and turned 180 degrees on the vertical axis before being forcefully shoved into the ground and expiring.//

**<End Log>**
-----
**Second Recovery Attempt Summary:** UA-038-POKG was informed that if it used its anomalous abilities on the MTF Pi-1 members at the location, Dr. Willow would be terminated. Recovery was successful and UA-038-POKG received SCP Classification and was assigned a temporary containment unit at Armed Biological Containment Area-14.

= **INTERVIEW WITH RESEARCHER ADAM WILLOW | <13/03/2014>**
-----
**Interviewee:** Dr. Ruth Redd 

**Interviewed:** Dr. Adam Willow

**Information:** Level 3 Researcher Dr. Adam Willow played a big part in the gathering of information relating to SCP-4375-1 and provided much of the information that is used in this document. Due to his involvement and cooperation, he was permitted to keep working for the SCP Foundation under amnesticization . According to Dr. Willow and SCP-4375-1, Adam was in a relationship with SCP-4375-1 prior to it receiving SCP Classification.
-----
**<Begin Log>**

**Dr. Redd:** How do you know SCP-4375-1?

**Dr. Willow:** He is... or was my boyfriend. 

//Dr. Willow is visibly uncomfortable.//

**Dr. Redd:** Okay. What are its abilities, exactly? What can it do?

**Dr. Willow:** He... He's a reality bender. We've never checked his humes but all I know is that he is strong. Really strong. I believe he would be a Class II or III...

**Dr. Redd:** Okay. We have had an idea since the creation of SCP-4375-1. We have an ongoing project centered around what you could call "mind control", basically allowing us to have our very own reality bender, one that we have full control over.

//Dr. Willow starts tearing up and is coughing into his arm.//

**Dr. Willow.** Please don't... please... I don't know what I would do if you did that to him. 

**Dr. Redd:** Okay. You now have a choice, Adam. Get amnesticized to forget all details about SCP-4375-1 and continue working for us, or be terminated. We expect you to comply.

//Dr. Willow is now crying.//

**Dr. Willow:** Is that really a choice, then? I don't have a choice in this. None at all. The Foundation isn't supposed to work like this. This isn't right.

//Dr. Willow rises up from his seat before being held down by a guard and detained.//

**<End Log>**

**Closing Statement:** The Field Use Project was continued and Dr. Willow was amnesticized.

-----
**SCP-4375-1 Field Use Project proposal**

 **Research Team: Specified research team from Site-45**

**Project Date: 13/05/2015**

**Proposal Statement:** //The aim of this project is to utilize SCP-4375-1 for field use through experimental technology that is currently in development. This would let the SCP Foundation have full control over the Class III reality bender, which would aid in the containment of other anomalies. Additionally, SCP-4375-1 could be used to stabilize or repair altered reality in order to prevent civilian knowledge of the SCP Foundation and prevent people being hurt by the effects of other anomalies.//
-----
**Research Team Lead:** Dr. Mo Castelo, Ph. D

**Assistant Leads:** Dr. Anna James, Ph.D, Dr. Edmund Charles, Ph. D

**Requested Resources:** 
* Full access to all documented research from Dr. Robert Scranton.
* Full access to all documented research from Dr. Jonathan Oscar. 
* Full access to all documented information regarding [DATA REDACTED].
* Full access to all documented information regarding the Scranton Reality Anchor (SRA) and all related research.
* Materials necessary to construct a specialized containment and testing facility fit for containing and researching reality bending anomalies.
* No fewer than 25 D-Class personnel for testing purposes.
-----
**Project Details:** Utilizing resources used to construct SRAs, the assigned research team has successfully constructed the miniature SRA that will be used to prevent the device used from succumbing  to the effects of SCP-4375-1. They have also utilized research from Dr. Jonathan Oscar to construct a device that can be used to manipulate brain activity and bodily movements based on a command-based system. This device will then be combined with the miniature SRA.

Specialized Containment And Research Site-4375-01 is to be constructed, disguised as a military base on the previous location of SCP-4375 in Northern Indiana, USA. It is to be constructed in a way similar to an Armed Biological Containment Site or Area, with a focus on reality bending anomalies. Only one containment unit will be needed, but more are to be constructed to be used if the initial containment unit is destroyed. SCP-4375-1 is to be contained at Armed Biological Containment Area-14 until Site-4375-01 is fully constructed.

-----
= **THE FOLLOWING DOCUMENTATION CONTAINS INFORMATION REGARDING THE SCP-4375-1 FIELD USE PROJECT, AND IS THEREFORE LEVEL 4/4375 CLASSIFIED BY ORDER OF THE ETHICS COMMITTEE.**
-----
**Foreword:** This document was developed by researchers at Research Site-45 as a way to utilize the anomalous properties of SCP-4375-1 in the field in a safe and controlled way in order to contain or destroy other anomalies and additionally to repair and restabilize reality where needed.

SCP-4375-1 has, since the completion of the SCP-4375-1 Field Use Project been relocated to the newly built Specialized Containment And Research Site-4375-01, which was created exclusively for the containment and research of and regarding SCP-4375-1. 

The project had to be delayed multiple times and had to be scrapped multiple times due to the difficulty of installing the YBOD-01 Device on SCP-4375-1 and the difficulty of working with an anomaly with such properties, although the involved researchers have agreed that the project has now given the desired results.

**The YBOD-01 Device:** The YBOD-01 Device is implanted into the Larynx, which is located at the back of the neck of the subject, where it is connected to nerves corresponding to all voluntary bodily movements, allowing non-voluntary bodily movements to continue without any alteration. The YBOD-01 Device also contains a miniature Scranton Reality Anchor to prevent the device from being affected by the anomalous properties of SCP-4375-1.

When SCP-4375-1 is in containment, the YBOD-01 Device is to have its active mode set to "Containment Mode". This prevents SCP-4375-1 from moving, forming thoughts and using its anomalous abilities.

When SCP-4375-1 is not in containment, the active mode of the device may be set to "Command Mode". Here, it can receive commands from a remote terminal, controlling its movements and anomalous properties.

The active mode of the YBOD-01 Device can be changed using a switch on the device. The device is not to be disabled at any time. Disabling the device may result in the complete destruction or reconstruction of the area surrounding SCP-4375-1.

**Note From The Ethics Committee:** //We completely understand your reservations about utilizing SCP-4375-1 for field use, especially if you knew it as Aaron West, prior to it receiving SCP classification.//

//We can assure you that the existence of SCP-4375-1 and the SCP-4375-1 Field Use Project has greatly aided the Foundation in the containment and neutralization of multiple other anomalies as we strive to keep normalcy while staying under the civilian radar.//

//And about Dr. Willow; he's not aware and will never be aware of this and is therefore not harmed by it. You should not feel sorry for him just like you should not feel sorry for SCP-4375-1.//

//For the greater good.// - The Ethics Committee.

= **RECOVERED DOCUMENTATION | <7/01/2018>**
-----
**Information:** During and after the discovery of SCP-4375, Dr. Willow utilized a notebook for documentation regarding the anomaly. The following excerpt contains said documentation:
-----
**PAGE 56:** Me and Aaron went out on a walk today. We seem to have found an undocumented anomaly. I walked onto it first and got a sharp headache and had my mind flooded with tons and tons of photographic memories of things I have experienced. All of my life from my birth and until now. Aaron got scared and backed away, so he didn't get affected. We returned home and I retrieved this notebook for documentation.

Probably a Safe-Class.
Probably a level 2 clearance file.
Promote me.
Hume reading might be somewhat higher than the surroundings. The air feels heavier, at least.
Gives you all your memories back.
You might be able to use this to bring back redacted memories, but we don't know. How do amnestics even work, man? 

**PAGE 57:** I'll probably be writing this file, so I'll just have to copy SOME of these notes and such to put in the file. 

Draft for the thing: 

Item number: SCP-?

Object class: safe

--Threat le--

Special containment procedures: SCP-? is to be contained where it was discovered. No containment is necessary, but the surrounding area is to be protected in order to prevent civilian knowledge of SCP-?

Description: SCP-? is a glade located in Indiana, USA. SCP-? restores memories of people inside its area of effect, and has a high hume level.

Discovery: SCP-? was discovered by Dr, Willow and Pvt. West 

**PAGE 58:** Can't really focus on writing the notes and file and such right now. Can't sleep either.

but like

did the chicken or the egg come first?

**PAGE 59:** I can't sleep right now. Nothing that’s very interesting has happened today, to be honest. Writing here because I’ve finished my book and looking at my phone will just keep me awake. I don’t even write here that often. 

**PAGE 60:** Nothing bad will happen.
-----
**Information:** The page transcribed below, as well as a used amnestics needle, a pile of ash and a cigarette end were retrieved from the location of Dr. Willow following his amnesticization. 
-----
**PAGE 61:** I'm burning up the last photo of us. I don't normally smoke, but I figured that this could be the first time. Won't remember it anyway, the amnestic is probably going into effect soon. I'm so sorry that it had to end like this. I love you, Aaron, I always will.
