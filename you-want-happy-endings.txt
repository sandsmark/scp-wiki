> May 12th, 2016. One of my few days off in spring. I drank milk straight from the jug without looking at the expiration date - it should have been spoiled for two days. It wasn't. Still fresh. 
> 
> 8:00 AM, Penny Naismith was off to school, and Mrs. Rosa Naismith told me that she had to go to a parent-teacher conference for Penny later.
> 
> "I'll go," I said.
> 
> "Don't," she said. "It's your day off."
> 
> "Last week, I saw a D-class eaten alive by a snake made of intrusive thoughts. I think I can deal with bitchy teachers."
> 
> Rosa grimaced, skeptical. //It's Mr. Glassman, isn't it,// I thought, starting to miss the Mind Viper.
> 
> 9:00 AM. I sip a mimosa. There's a classic Doctor Who marathon on PBS. Old Tom Bakers. Rosa catches me grinning ear-to-ear as the title theme comes on. She laughs. 
> 
> 3:00 PM. Mr. Glassman, assistant principal, told me that my daughter "doesn't handle bullies well."
> 
> I said, "then how about we do something about the kids trying to provoke her?"
> 
> He said, "look, when she's older, you won't be there to force her to toughen up. Do you want to coddle your daughter all your life, or let her build character?"
> 
> Half an hour of smiling and nodding later, I took a photo out of my wallet. Said it was of Penny at her baptism. 
> 
> The photo was a of NARCISSUS-class visual cognitohazard that had just been decommissioned. Seeing the foam come from his mouth was one of the finer points of my life as a father, and well worth the reprimand from the O5 council.
> 
> Mr. Glassman's still healthy, of course. Only difference is, he believes that if Penny ever cries, a seven-foot-tall eel-man lurking outside his peripheral vision will eat his eyeballs. 
> 
> 6:00 PM. Penny and I watched a movie that introduced her to swear words. She laughed hard enough to start wheezing. 
> 
> 8:00 PM. Penny's in bed early, contented. 
> 
> 8:30 PM. Pretty sure I can't go into detail on a Foundation email server, but Rosa's still got it after ten years. My pelvis still hurts thinking about it. God Bless America.

> Fuck you.

> You want sad endings?

> Again, fuck you.
> 
> There are only endings. If 15 years of service to a shadow fascist organization bent on locking up all our demons in boxes has taught me anything, it's that "good" and "bad" are completely subjective. One man's ZK-class reality failure is another man's orgasm.

> You got this, Lisle. You're making Penny and Rosa proud, and Dr. Henderson too, wherever he is.
>  
> Don't let the nihilists and quitters seduce you. There will be more May 12th, 2016's if you can keep the bastards locked up.

> And if you can help it, don't detonate the on-site nuke until you've finished the Tom Baker episodes.
