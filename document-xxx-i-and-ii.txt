title:Document 860-I and II
Below are the transcripts of exploration I and II into [[[SCP-860|SCP-860-1]]].
Exploration I realized on ██/██/████.
Exploration II realized on ██/██/████.

**Exploration I**

//(D-3456 is a 31-year old Caucasian male of average build. Psychological background is unremarkable. Class-D designation is the result of a demotion due to [DATA EXPUNGED]. D-3456 is equipped with a LED flashlight, a handheld camcorder fitted with a transmission stream, and an audio headset for communication with Dr. ███ at Control.)//

//D-3456 inserts SCP-860 in the door leading to an abandoned house on ████████████ street, ██████, Germany. He turns the key and opens the door, revealing SCP-860-1. D-3456 staggers.//

**Dr. ███:** Please proceed.

//D-3456 hesitates, then passes through the door. After he takes two steps, a loud bang is heard. D-3456 turns quickly. The door is closed and attached to a large concrete wall. D-3456 moves towards it and attempts to turn the knob.//

**D-3456:** ████, this ████ is locked! How the hell'm I supposed to—
**Dr. ███:** Please follow the trail, D-3456. The exit should be on the other side.

//D-3456 sighs, then turns around and walks down the trail. After walking 64 meters, D-3456 stops.//

**D-3456:** Did you hear that?
**Dr. ███:** No sound came through the audio feed.
**D-3456:** It sounded like… a howl… or… or something. Came from the woods, seemed far away.
**Dr. ███:** A howl? Like a wolf?
**D-3456:** Not… exactly. Sounded weird. Distorted.
**Dr. ███:** Please proceed down the trail.

//D-3456 starts walking again, with increased speed. After 43 meters, the mist starts to thicken and acquire a deeper shade of blue.//

**D-3456:** It's starting to get really hard to see here. This ███████ flashlight isn't—

//D-3456 suddenly starts to turn around.//

**D-3456:** [shouting] ████! ████! Did you hear it now?
**Dr. ███:** Nothing came through the audio feed, D-3456. What did you hear?
**D-3456:** [shouting] Same thing as before! Closer! How the ████ didn't you hear it, it was—
**Dr. ███:** Please continue to follow the trail, D-3456.
**D-3456:** [shouting] No, you don't get it, it—

//An loud roar can be heard coming from D-3456's left. D-3456 screams and starts running down the trail. Every ten seconds, the sound of steps coming from behind D-3456 can be heard, starting off distant and increasing in volume until they appear to be less than one meter from D-3456, at which point they stop.//

//After running more 68 meters, D-3456 reaches a large concrete wall with a door in it. D-3456 kicks the door open, revealing the main hall of the abandoned house. D-3456 enters, turns around and closes the door. Two minutes later, he opens the door again, revealing ████████████ street. D-3456 shows extreme paranoia for the following weeks, claiming to hear the same howl in the distance when alone. Effects seemed to fade after ██ weeks. D-3456 now behaves normally.//

//Close analysis of the audio feed revealed that a very low sound could be heard the second time D-3456 stopped. The sound file containing the amplified sound can be found  [http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/how-to-write-an-scp/preview.wav here.]//

**Exploration II**

//(D-5674 is a 27-year old Asiatic female of below-average physical fitness. Psychological background indicates extreme xenophobia. Subject has an extensive record of [DATA EXPUNGED]. D-5674 is equipped with an LED flashlight, a handheld camcorder fitted with a transmission stream, and an audio headset for communication with Dr. ███ at Control.)//

//D-5674 inserts SCP-860 in the door leading to an abandoned house on ████████████ street, ██████, Germany. She turns the key and open the door, revealing SCP-860-1. D-5674 passes through the door. After she takes two steps, a loud bang is heard. D-5674 turns. The door is closed and attached to a large concrete wall.//

**D-5674:** [EXPLETIVE REDACTED]
**Dr. ███:** Follow the trail, D-5674. The exit is on the other side.

//D-5674 turns around and walks down the trail. After 94 meters, D-5674 stops and turns to the woods.//

**D-5674:** Did you… did you see that?
**Dr. ███:** What?
**D-5674:** Did you see those… those…
**Dr. ███:** …yes?

//D-5674 is silent.//

**Dr. ███:** What did you see?

//D-5674 does not respond. Twelve seconds later, she resumes walking down the trail.//

**Dr. ███:** D-5674, please report what you saw, we need—
**D-5674:** It was nothing. Mist must've tricked me.

//D-5674 walks for more 10 meters before stopping again.//

**Dr. ███:** D-5674, why did you stop?
**D-5674:** [low monotone] Silence… can't you hear it?
**Dr. ███:** What?
**D-5674:** [low monotone] It's calling me… I have to… I have to go…
**Dr. ███:** D-5674, you can't—

//D-5674 removes the headset and puts the camera on the ground, facing the trees. She proceeds to walk off the trail, into the woods, until she disappears from sight. Nothing more happens until the camera's batteries run down.//

**Addendum:** The door leading to the empty room remained closed. Attempts to remove the key from the lock failed, as did all attempts to open or break the door. Seven months after the incident, the door suddenly opened and discharged a very old Asiatic woman. When questioned, she affirmed herself to be D-5674. She refused to elaborate on what happened after she left the camera on the ground, even under extreme pressure. Subject was found to be much calmer and more polite than before Exploration II, and, apart from talking about what occured to her inside SCP-860-1, followed every order issued to her without complaints. Two weeks later, she died in her sleep of natural causes.
