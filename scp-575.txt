**Item #:** SCP-575

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:**

Any and all instances of SCP-575 are to be immediately isolated and contained with Protocol AL-9O77 (see **Advanced Lighting and Emergency Containment Strategies** handbook) and transported to secured containment.  Should an instance of SCP-575 exceed a safely containable size, Protocol AL-9O77-B is to be used to divide and isolate SCP-575 in to smaller instances. Each instance should be assigned a unique sub-number to identify its containment location for proper monitoring.

Containment units are to be made of two airtight rooms connected by airlocking seals. The outer room, Containment A, is to remain lit at all times, with no less then two back-up generators on stand-by. Light fixtures are to be checked weekly, and any blackouts in Containment A will result in immediate lockdown until total illumination is restored.  No personnel should enter Containment A at any time if light sources are down, in addition all personnel entering Containment A should carry at least two personal light sources.

The inner containment unit, Containment B, is to be coated in a layer of pure calcium both inside and out.  Personnel entering Containment B are to be fitted with LED-embedded clothing and equipped with portable floodlights in case of emergency.  Interaction with SCP-575 should be limited to sample collection and observation.  Any samples obtained from SCP-575 must be treated in the same manner as the original source and all test areas must have calcium lining and emergency illumination procedures similar to those outlined here.

Any and all civilian deaths resulting from SCP-575 are to be attributed to wild animal attack/scavenger predation of an already deceased subject.  Should deeper scrutiny be applied, attacks are to be blamed on a serial killer/satanic cult, and any additional information is sealed “due to ongoing investigation”.

**Description:**

SCP-575 appears to be an unknown form of matter, taking the form of a series of amorphous black shapes and structures.  SCP-575 is difficult to observe, as it immediately dissipates when exposed to light.  Current testing seems to indicate that SCP-575 is capable of displaying the  properties of solids, gases, waves, and particles. It has also been observed to display these behaviors in any combination at any time.  Despite the lack of visible nervous systems or functioning organic components, SCP-575 displays behavior consistent with an active consciousness.

SCP-575 generally manifests in total darkness.  How this occurs is unknown, however tests have shown a variable mass of SCP-575 forming when [DATA EXPUNGED] variable, along with the time frame.  SCP-575 is capable of “floating” and can alter its density, allowing it to pass through almost any opening or breech.  SCP-575 prefers very dark, isolated locations in which to settle after its initial formation, and will remain there until it reaches “critical mass” at [DATA EXPUNGED]

SCP-575 grows with the absorption of biological material.  SCP-575 will “attack” living things by solidifying portions of itself and using these “appendages” to bludgeon, cut and crush target prey.  The tracking and selection methods used by SCP-575 are currently not understood.  Upon capturing prey SCP-575 will removes portions of the tissue and “grind” it, after which it will “absorb” the resulting material similar to the chewing process of humans.  SCP-575 either is unable to or unwilling to interact with objects rich in calcium however, and “nesting areas” for SCP-575 can be identified by the large amount of bones, teeth, and calcified dust around them. This aversion to calcium extends beyond food sources to environmental sources as well, providing an effective means of containment so long as protocol is followed correctly.

[[/div]]

SCP-575 is capable of manifesting in any area of total darkness after a period of [DATA EXPUNGED] of accelerating that time table.  The origin point of SCP-575 infestations is currently unknown and it is unclear how it spreads from area to area.  SCP-575 was initially recovered under the home of Mr. █████ ███, where it had achieved “critical mass” and had begun predation of the local population.  Since this initial contact, ███ instances of SCP-575 have been recovered, in ██ countries.  At present most instances ofSCP-575 have manifested more commonly in man-made structures. The cause for this preference is unknown and has raised concern that SCP-575 may be the evolution of a natural predator of man although it has also been suggested that the building behaviors of man simply provide more suitable “nesting” areas in structures such as underground parking and underground storage.
