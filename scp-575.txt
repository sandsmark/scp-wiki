**Item #:** SCP-575

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:**

Any and all instances of SCP-575 are to be immediately isolated and contained with Protocol AL-9O77 (see Advanced Lighting and Emergency Containment Strategies handbook) and transported to secured containment.  Should an instance of SCP-575 exceed a safely containable size, Protocol AL-9O77 is to be use to divide and isolate SCP-575 in to smaller instances.  

Containment unit is to be made of two airtight rooms with airlock seals in each.  The outer room (Containment A) is to remain lit at all times, with no less then two back-up generators on stand-by.  Light fixtures are to be checked weekly, and any blackouts in Containment A will result in immediate lockdown until total illumination is restored.

The inner containment unit (Containment B) is to be coated in a layer of pure calcium both inside and out.  Personnel entering Containment B are to be fitted with LED-embedded clothing, and equipped with portable floodlights in case of emergency.  Interaction with SCP-575 should be limited to sample collection and observation.  Any samples of SCP-575 must be treated in the same manner as SCP-575, and all test areas must have calcium lining and emergency illumination procedures.

Any and all civilian deaths resulting from SCP-575 are to be attributed to wild animal attack/scavenger predation of an already deceased subject.  Should deeper scrutiny be applied, attacks are to be blamed on a serial killer/satanic cult, and any additional information is sealed “due to ongoing investigation”.
