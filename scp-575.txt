**Item #:** SCP-575

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:**

Any and all instances of SCP-575 are to be immediately isolated and contained with Protocol AL-9O77 (see Advanced Lighting and Emergency Containment Strategies handbook) and transported to secured containment.  Should an instance of SCP-575 exceed a safely containable size, Protocol AL-9O77 is to be use to divide and isolate SCP-575 in to smaller instances.  

Containment unit is to be made of two airtight rooms with airlock seals in each.  The outer room (Containment A) is to remain lit at all times, with no less then two back-up generators on stand-by.  Light fixtures are to be checked weekly, and any blackouts in Containment A will result in immediate lockdown until total illumination is restored.

The inner containment unit (Containment B) is to be coated in a layer of pure calcium both inside and out.  Personnel entering Containment B are to be fitted with LED-embedded clothing, and equipped with portable floodlights in case of emergency.  Interaction with SCP-575 should be limited to sample collection and observation.  Any samples of SCP-575 must be treated in the same manner as SCP-575, and all test areas must have calcium lining and emergency illumination procedures.

Any and all civilian deaths resulting from SCP-575 are to be attributed to wild animal attack/scavenger predation of an already deceased subject.  Should deeper scrutiny be applied, attacks are to be blamed on a serial killer/satanic cult, and any additional information is sealed “due to ongoing investigation”.

**Description:**

SCP-575 appears to be an unknown form of matter, taking the form of a mass of amorphous black shapes and structures.  SCP-575 is difficult to observe, as it immediately dissipates when exposed to light.  However, current testing has shown that SCP-575 exhibits properties of both a solid, gas, wave, and particle, sometimes at the same time.  There also appears to be some form of consciousness associated with SCP-575, despite its total lack of any nervous system or other organic components.

SCP-575 appears to manifest in total darkness.  How this occurs is unknown, however tests have shown a variable mass of SCP-575 forming when [DATA EXPUNGED] variable, along with the time frame.  SCP-575 is capable of “floating” and can alter its density, allowing it to pass through almost any opening.  SCP-575 will typically find a very dark, isolated location shortly after its initial formation, and remain there until it reaches “critical mass” at [DATA EXPUNGED]

SCP-575 grows with the absorption of biological material.  SCP-575 will “attack” living things by solidifying portions of it, and using these “appendages” to bludgeon, cut and crush prey items.  How it is able to sense and track subjects is unknown.  SCP-575 will removes portions of tissue and “grind” it, after which it will “absorb” the resulting material.  SCP-575 appears to be unable to process calcium, however, and “nesting areas” for SCP-575 can be identified by the large amount of bones and bone dust around them.  SCP-575 also appears to be unable to “pass though” calcium, and can be trapped if high amounts of it are present.

SCP-575 is capable of manifesting in any area of total darkness after a period of [DATA EXPUNGED] of accelerating that time table.  SCP-575 was initially recovered under the home of Mr. █████ ███, where it had achieved “critical mass” and had begun predation of the local population.  Since this initial contact, ███ instances of SCP-575 have been recovered, in ██ countries.  SCP-575 seems to manifest more commonly in man-made structures then any other, however the cause for this is unknown.
