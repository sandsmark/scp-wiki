**Item #:** SCP-1575

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1575 is to be held in a 6m x 6m x 4m containment chamber at Bio-Site 23, with direct access to Research Laboratory 3 at same. Except when in use for testing, no water is to be allowed into SCP-1575's containment, and after testing all water used is to be held in quarantine for use in further tests.

**Description:** SCP-1575 is a marble statue, standing approx. 2.75m high with an additional base of 0.5m. The statue is a depiction of Venus (Roman goddess of love, beauty, fertility and seduction) clad only in wrappings from the waist downwards. The statue acts as a fountainhead; damage to the base shows that it was likely intended as a permanent installation, with a single channel running from underneath the base up through a hole in the mouth. SCP-1575 shows no anomalous properties on its own, nor do samples removed from the whole. An inscription on the base, partially obscured by the above-mentioned damage, indicates it to have been sculpted in the early 16th century for a private collection in ██████████, Italy.

Any otherwise fresh water which is allowed to pour through SCP-1575 in its nature as a fountain (henceforth referred to as SCP-1575-1) is shown to have mutagenic properties when consumed or otherwise introduced into a body; external application (including long-term submergence) does not trigger a mutation. Non-human mammalian creatures who consume at least 0.5 liters of SCP-1575-1 daily will begin mutating into a human being over the course of roughly one month, with ethnicity roughly in accordance with humans native to the species' natural habitats. For example, a European deer will have primarily Caucasian features post-mutation, while a North American deer will have features like those of Native Americans. Curiously, most modern breeds of dogs and cats will have indistinct or mixed racial features.

Survivors of this process describe it as extremely painful, and it has an approximate 25% fatality rate for females. Males experience a 95% fatality rate, with most survivors having an androgynous appearance with non-functional or completely  missing genitalia. Additionally, there is a 40% chance that the animal will retain one or more pre-mutation features, such as fur, paws instead of hands and/or feet, a tail, non-human ears, etc. The final apparent age of the subject is normally in accordance to the stage of life of the creature involved (prepubescent, adolescent, adult, elderly).

It should be noticed that cases where the subject is gaining or losing a significant amount of mass, appetites and bodily functions will shift to match. A Japanese field mouse (//Apodemus argenteus//) was observed to consume roughly 85% of its bodily mass once every two hours until it died when its circulatory system was unable to keep pace with the increase in its side; similarly, an adult American grizzly bear (//Ursus arctos horribilis//) did not consume anything besides SCP-1575-1 during its transformation, and its waste was shown to contain excessive [DATA EXPUNGED].

After a successful mutation is completed, subjects normally display an intelligence level somewhere between what is considered average for their species and average human intellect. Most subjects which develop proper vocal chords are able to learn to speak, but only those raised in captivity show any human language skills immediately after mutation, and even then only in a rudimentary form.

SCP-1575-1 does not have any notable effect on a creature's personality, memories or instincts; all carry over from the individual animal's existing self despite drastic restructuring of the brain.

Humans have not been observed to experience any notable effects when ingesting SCP-1575-1. Non-mammalian creatures will mutate, but due to significant physiological differences they will have a 99.9% fatality rate due to drastic and incongruous physiological differences. Only █ non-mammalian mutations were known to have stabilized, and both were euthanized after brief study.

**Addendum 1575-1:** SCP-1575 was recovered from a facility named "The Miracle Farm", previously owned and operated by Marshall, Carter & Dark Ltd. The stated goal of the facility was to "present our clients with the finest in custom-ordered pets, prey and companions." Mobile Task Force Theta-2 ("Moreau's Morgue") was able to secure the facility, ██ on-hand personnel, █ attending clients, and ███ living specimens in various stages of mutation; only █ specimens were deemed fit for transportation and study, all others euthanized on-site. Farm personnel and clients were detained for questioning, then given class A amnesiacs and released. A cover story of a runaway fire was implanted in their memories before release to explain the destruction of their facility.

According to obtained records, at least ██ specimens were known to be in possession of clients of MC&D. MTF Theta-2's current mission is to track down and recover or destroy said specimens; thus far, █ have been accounted for.

**Addendum 1575-2:** Notice from Dr. ████ regarding a minor containment breach involving SCP-1575:

> Following the incident on the twelfth of this month, any animals to be used in testing with SCP-1575 is to be
> thoroughly examined for both external //and// internal parasites. SCP-1575-1 apparently retains its mutagenic
> properties, even when ingested secondarily through the host's lower GI tract or blood stream. We absolutely
> do not need another instance of giant half-human-half-flea creatures, and the psychologist is having a hard
> time helping Janet with her nightmares of a seven foot long tapeworm with a screaming face tearing out of
> the belly of a dog. Remember your procedures, people!
> 
> Also, on advice from my colleagues, we have installed an electronically controlled air-lock system in Lab 3. No
> more panicked research assistants forgetting protocol and bursting out through a single door, letting control 
> subjects out, necessitating area lockdown and assuring their demotion to Security Level 0. If anyone sees
> Debra during her shift in the cafeteria, let her know it's nothing personal, just that sometimes an example must
> be set and she at least still has a job.
