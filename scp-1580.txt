**Item #:** SCP-1580

**Object Class:** Safe; Fully Contained, Instances Secured.

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1580 is currently held in the Site-30 terrarium, with a 7 by 7 meter lot. Instances of SCP-1580-1 are to be constantly monitored for alterations in behavior or vocalizations.

**Description:** SCP-1580 is a //Quercus virginiana// specimen, also known as the Southern Live Oak. It currently has a limb spread of 19 meters and is 22 meters in height. SCP-1580's age is currently estimated to be 67 years, and shows no remarkable qualities regarding its physical appearance. SCP-1580 will shed its leaves at a heightened pace, ranging from 70 to 180 in one minute. SCP-1580's main anomalous property is noticeable from the autonomous nature of its leaves, designated instances of SCP-1580-1.

Instances of SCP-1580-1 display no anomalous properties until they are no longer attached to SCP-1580; this may be caused through either manual removal by outside forces or SCP-1580's anomalous property. Upon making contact with a solid surface, an instance of SCP-1580-1 will sprout four limbs, originating from its veins. SCP-1580-1's veins will grow about 2 cm from their original positions, and are used for bipedal mobility.

After developing these limbs, SCP-1580-1 will attempt to travel to where it originally grew on SCP-1580. It will use all four limbs to climb SCP-1580's trunk; once it reaches its original location, it will seamlessly reattach its stipule to the branch by physical contact. Instances of SCP-1580-1 appear to display sentience, as they wait for other instances to reattach themselves before continuing to climb to their branch. Preventing an instance from reaching its branch will cause its limbs to recede back into itself, and it will begin to decompose normally.

Faint whispering of approximately 18 db can be heard from all instances. Attempts to record single instances of SCP-1580-1 will cause the instance to become silent, and no coherent speaking can be singled out in recordings of all instances at once. Further study on the possibility of sapience is underway.

**Addendum 1580-A:** Two instances of SCP-1580-1 were found to be emitting vocalizations louder than all others present (at 38 db). The following is a transcript of the video and audio recording from SCP-1580's containment chamber.

> **SCP-1580-1-A** Dammit, you know my patience ran out after my momma took her time growing me out. Why the fuck should I have to wait for them to move their stipules? [sic]
