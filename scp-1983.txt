**Item #:** SCP-1983

**Object Class:** Keter (Presumed Neutralized)

**Special Containment Procedures:** Outpost 54 has been built on the land surrounding SCP-1983 and disguised as a chemical plant.  The "plant" building serves as barracks for MTF Chi-13 Choir Boys.  All entry points into Outpost 54 are to be guarded at all times.  Personnel will be review Document 1983-12, which details the cover story to be given to any civilians expressing curiousity.

All MTF personnel must profess strong religious beliefs, per Chi-13 protocols.  "All ammunition stocked must have a silver or silver-tipped projectile.  A 24-hour watch is to be maintained on the front door of SCP-1983-1.  Guards are to engage any instances of SCP-1983-2 on sight.  No personnel is to approach within five meters of SCP-1983-1 outside of scheduled testing protocol.

UPDATE: Following the Event 1983-23, a standdown of Outpost 54 has been authorized.  A skeleton crew will remain to monitor SCP-1983 for any further activity.  Arms intended for use against instances of SCP-1983-2 are to be maintained at Outpost 54 armory.

**Description:** SCP-1983-1 is a one-story farmhouse in ███████ County, Wyoming.  It was abandoned in 1968 after a series of grisly murders, allegedly performed by a "Satanic" cult.  Please see capture logs for SCP-████ for further details.

The front door of SCP-1983-1, when opened, appears to contain a spatial anomaly.  Neither matter nor light has been observed to exit the doorway, save for instances of SCP-1983-2 (though the anomaly is exothermic).

SCP-1983-1 is accessible through other entrances, including windows, the back door, and entrances cut into the back of SCP-1983-1.  However, the front room does not appear to exist inside of SCP-1983-1.  Doors that should lead to the front room instead lead to other doors inside the building.  Measurements of the inside and outside of SCP-1983-1 are inconsistent.  Holes cut through the interior walls of SCP-1983-1 that should lead to the front room lead instead to the outside walls around the front of SCP-1983-1, but stop ten feet on either side of the doorway.  Attempts to drill into the front room of SCP-1983-1 from the outside have led to the exposure of smaller portions of the anomaly, though instances of SCP-1983-2 have not been observed to exit them. Further attempts to breach the wall have been forbidden by O5-03, due to the possibility of allowing increased potential for instances of SCP-1983-2 to appear.

SCP-1983-2 are bipedal creatures approximately 1.8 meters tall.  They are vaguely humanoid, and entirely black in color.  They are highly aggressive and will engage any human on sight.  When an instance of SCP-1983-2 comes into contact with a human, they extend an upper limb into the human's chest cavity, without any apparent damage to skin or tissues.  Through unknown means, they then extract the heart, killing the human.  Once it has acquired a human heart, an instance of SCP-1983-2 will return to SCP-1983-1.

Silver munitions fired while offering prayer is the only known method of killing SCP-1983-2.  The precise form of the prayer or religion of the supplicant do not appear to matter, so long as the prayer is sincere.  Once killed, the bodies of SCP-1983-2 appear to "evaporate," leaving a small layer of sulfur.

SCP-1983 was discovered after a series of mysterious deaths in the vicinity of ███████ County.  Foundation investigators encountered instances of SCP-1983-2 and were able to trace them back to SCP-1983-1.

**Addendum 1:** A team from MTF Chi-13 was sent through the front doorway to attempt to investigate the anomaly.  They did not return.  However, shortly after they entered, the front door appeared, closing in the frame.  No further manifestations of SCP-1983-2 appeared.

**Addendum 2:** A second assault team entered SCP-1983-1 to determine the fate of the first assault team.  They did not return.  The door did not close.  Shortly after new manifestations of SCP-1983-2 appeared, Agent Morris entered the doorway, which closed shortly after.

**Addendum 3:** On May 23, 1989, D-14134 was given a closed circuit camera tethered to a monitor by a 25 meter cord.  He was instructed to examine as much of the area as he could, and then attempt to return.  Once through the doorway, feed from the camera was interrupted.  The cord was pulled taut, and then snapped.

Several hours afterward, the anomaly in SCP-1983-1 disappeared.  Inside, the dessicated remains of several agents were discovered, as well as [[[Document 1983-15]]], an informal SCP report written by an agent within the anomaly.  The SCP is presumed to have been neutralized by D-14134, who was posthumously awarded the Foundation star (one of only two awarded to Class-D Personnel).  Due to information contained in Document 1983-15, it is believed that the anomaly was not localized, as previously believed, and renewed resources have gone into attempting to locate similar incidents.
