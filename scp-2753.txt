**Item #:** SCP-2753

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** A Foundation-operated bot (I/O-DOOM) is to monitor internet traffic for SCP-2753. Upon discovery, all data containing SCP-2753 is to be destroyed. Anyone outside of Foundation personnel aware of SCP-2753 is to be apprehended, interrogated, and amnesticized.

Instances of SCP-2753-A are to be kept disassembled in a secure locker on-site. Instances of SCP-2753-B and SCP-2753-C are to be handled on a case-by-case basis. Tests are prohibited at this time.

**Description:** SCP-2753 is a 3 dimensional ratio that can be used to describe the relationship between the sides of a block.

Instances of SCP-2753-A are blocks which match SCP-2753's projection within a certain threshold; they can otherwise be of any size and material. They exhibit their anomalous property only when 42 instances of similar size and material are assembled into a standard Jenga[[footnote]]Jenga is a game wherein blocks are assembled into a tower; players then take turns removing blocks and placing them on top while trying to avoid a collapse.[[/footnote]] tower: If this tower collapses, any structure containing it will immediately collapse with it. 

Since 2009, the growing popularity and accuracy of 3D printing combined with SCP-2753's presentation within OBJ files[[footnote]]OBJ is a geometry definition file format used as instructions for many commercially available 3D printers.[[/footnote]] as a printable Jenga set has led to 21 structural collapses, 35 injuries, and 14 deaths.

> The collapse of a warehouse used to host the Boston Anomalous Art Expo[[footnote]]The Boston Anomalous Art Expo (BAAE) is an underground art exposition dedicated to sharing works from various anartists.[[/footnote]] was linked to an instance of SCP-2753-A. 14 additional anomalous objects (including SCP-████, SCP-████, and SCP-████) were also recovered amidst the wreckage. The collapse left over 49 participants injured and 21 dead. The following note was discovered nearby:
> 
>> How High Can High Art Get? Let's Find Out!
>> 
>> This tower is to be assembled at the start of the exposition; audience members are encouraged to take turns trying to take art higher and higher!
>> 
>> But be warned: High art carries high risk! Reach too high, and you might just find your paradigm comes crashing down right on top of your head!

> Based on information provided by an undisclosed source, the Foundation-operated bot (I/O-DOOM) was used to search for SCP-2753 projections in financial market data. The collapse of several investment firms and multi-level marketing[[footnote]]Multi-Level Marketing (MLM) is a business strategy relying primarily on pyramid-shaped commission systems to produce profits.[[/footnote]] companies were unexpectedly linked to SCP-2753. 
> 
> Further investigation has demonstrated the existence of SCP-2753-B instances. Instances are financial assets that match SCP-2753's projection within a certain threshold; they can otherwise be of any value and type. They exhibit their anomalous property only when 42 instances of similar value and type are assembled into an interdependent network: If this network loses solvency, any corporate entity linked to it will experience an immediate catastrophic financial collapse.
> 
> Foundation efforts are currently underway to discover all such networks and safely disassemble them.

Instances are files with specific attributes matching SCP-2753's projection within a certain threshold; they can otherwise be of any size and type. They exhibit their anomalous property only when 42 instances of similar size and type are accessed simultaneously by a single program. If this program crashes unexpectedly, any network running this program will experience an immediate catastrophic failure.
