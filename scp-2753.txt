**Item #:** SCP-2753

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** A Foundation-operated bot (I/O-YUZE) is to monitor internet traffic for SCP-2753. Upon discovery, all data containing SCP-2753 is to be destroyed. Anyone outside of Foundation personnel aware of SCP-2753 is to be apprehended, interrogated, and amnesticized.

Instances of SCP-2753-A are to be kept disassembled in a secure locker on-site. Instances of SCP-2753-B are to be handled on a case-by-case basis. Tests are prohibited at this time.

**Description:** SCP-2753 is a 3D geometric projection typically contained in an OBJ file[[footnote]]A geometry definition file format used as instructions for many commercial 3D printers.[[/footnote]]. This projection describes a distinctly shaped block.

Instances of SCP-2753-A are blocks which match SCP-2753's projection; they can be of any size and material. They exhibit their anomalous property only when 54 identical instances are assembled into a standard Jenga[[footnote]]A game wherein blocks are assembled into a tower; players then take turns removing blocks and placing them on top of the tower while trying to avoid causing a collapse.[[/footnote]] tower: If this tower collapses, any structure containing it will collapse with it. Although SCP-2753-A instances are not indestructible, they consistently survive these collapses without suffering significant damage.

SCP-2753 was discovered on 19/02/1991 after the collapse of a warehouse being used to host the Boston Anomalous Art Expo[[footnote]]An underground art exposition dedicated to sharing works from various anartists.[[/footnote]]. Amidst the wreckage, the Foundation recovered an instance of SCP-2753-A along with 16 other anomalous objects (including SCP-████, SCP-████, SCP-████, and SCP-████). The collapse left over 60 participants injured and 14 dead. The following note was discovered nearby:

> How High Can High Art Get? Let's Find Out!
> 
> This tower is to be assembled at the start of the exposition; audience members are encouraged to take turns trying to take art higher and higher!
> 
> But be warned: High art carries high risk! Reach too high, and you might just find your paradigm comes crashing down right on top of your head!

Since 1991, the emergence of 3D printing combined with SCP-2753's presentation as a printable Jenga set has led to 17 structural collapses, 21 injuries, and 9 deaths.

**Addendum:** On 12/07/2011, a minor bug led the Foundation-operated bot (I/O-YUZE) to search for SCP-2753 projections in financial market models. The collapse of several investment firms and multi-level marketing[[footnote]]A marketing strategy relying on pyramid-shaped commission systems to produce profits.[[/footnote]] companies were unexpectedly linked to SCP-2753. 

Further investigation has demonstrated the existence of SCP-2753-B instances. Each instance is a network of 54 identical interdependent financial holdings. Should this network experience an overall loss of solvency, any corporate entity linked to those holdings will immediately experience a catastrophic financial collapse.

Foundation efforts are currently underway to discover all SCP-2753-B instances and safely disassemble them.
