**Item #:** SCP-2753

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** A Foundation-operated bot (I/O-YUZE) is to monitor internet traffic for SCP-2753. Upon discovery, all data containing SCP-2753 is to be destroyed. Anyone outside of Foundation personnel aware of SCP-2753 is to be apprehended, interrogated, and amnesticized.

Instances of SCP-2753-A are to be kept disassembled in a secure locker on-site. Instances of SCP-2753-B are to be handled on a case-by-case basis. Tests are prohibited at this time.

**Description:** SCP-2753 is a 3 dimensional ratio that can be used to describe the relationship between the sides of a block. 

Instances of SCP-2753-A are blocks which match SCP-2753's projection within a certain threshold; they can otherwise be of any size and material. They exhibit their anomalous property only when 54 instances of similar size and material are assembled into a standard Jenga[[footnote]]A game wherein blocks are assembled into a tower; players then take turns removing blocks and placing them on top of the tower while trying to avoid causing a collapse.[[/footnote]] tower: If this tower collapses, any structure containing it will immediately collapse with it. Although SCP-2753-A instances are not indestructible, they consistently survive these collapses without suffering significant damage.

SCP-2753 was discovered on 19/02/1991 after the collapse of a warehouse being used to host the Boston Anomalous Art Expo[[footnote]]An underground art exposition dedicated to sharing works from various anartists.[[/footnote]]. Amidst the wreckage, the Foundation recovered an instance of SCP-2753-A along with 16 other anomalous objects (including SCP-████, SCP-████, SCP-████, and SCP-████). The collapse left over 60 participants injured and 14 dead. The following note was discovered nearby:

> How High Can High Art Get? Let's Find Out!
> 
> This tower is to be assembled at the start of the exposition; audience members are encouraged to take turns trying to take art higher and higher!
> 
> But be warned: High art carries high risk! Reach too high, and you might just find your paradigm comes crashing down right on top of your head!

Since 2007, the growing popularity and accuracy of 3D printing combined with SCP-2753's presentation within OBJ files[[footnote]]A geometry definition file format used as instructions for many commercially available 3D printers.[[/footnote]] as a printable Jenga set has led to 17 structural collapses, 21 injuries, and 9 deaths.

**Addendum 2753.1:** On 12/07/2011, a minor bug led the Foundation-operated bot (I/O-YUZE) to search for SCP-2753 projections in financial market data. The collapse of several investment firms and multi-level marketing[[footnote]]A marketing strategy relying on pyramid-shaped commission systems to produce profits.[[/footnote]] companies were unexpectedly linked to SCP-2753. 

Further investigation has demonstrated the existence of SCP-2753-B instances. Each instance is a financial asset that matches SCP-2753's projection within a certain threshold; they can otherwise be of any value and type. They exhibit their anomalous property only when 54 instances of similar value and type are assembled into an interdependent network: If this network loses solvency, any corporate entity linked to it will experience an immediate catastrophic financial collapse. SCP-2753-B instances consistently survive these events without losing additional value. Foundation efforts are currently underway to discover all such networks and safely disassemble them.

**Addendum 2753.2:** On 15/05/2015, several IntSCPFN[[footnote]]The International SCP Foundation Network, a secure global network established in 1993 with the purpose of synchronizing the availability of Foundation information across Sites and countries.[[/footnote]] servers experienced critical crashes simultaneously. Analysis of data found the crash occurred as a result of an update made to an SCP file which invalidated several cross-links to that file.

Further analysis determined the existence of a network of crosslinks involving 54 such files, all of which describe similar (and related) anomalies. It is now believed these anomalies are associated with the AWCY organization.
