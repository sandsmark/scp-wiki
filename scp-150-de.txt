**Item #.:** SCP-150-DE

**Object Class:** Thaumiel

**Special Containment Procedures:** Although its existence and properties cannot be kept secret from the personnel of the Foundation, information regarding SCP-150-DE, its manufacture, and the content of Protocol ATLAS are only to be made available for staff with the security clearance 3/150-DE or higher. 

Instances of SCP-150-DE are only to be produced on demand and only when a suitable user has been chosen. Should the user expire before the completion of the instance or if they are no longer available for other reasons, then either a fitting replacement is to be procured as fast as within the bounds of the protocol possible or the SCP-150-DE instance to be stored in at least three (3) different locations to impede theft until a new fitting user has been found. 

Users of SCP-150-DE are to be chosen from trained MTF of security personnel exclusively. Significant traits for this qualification include character, psychological profile, experience, bodily fitness, physique and loyalty towards the Foundation. Their bodies are to be modified for the usage and the probands to be subjected to further training, so that they may work with the sensory input from SCP-150-DE. The exact specifications to this and the process of the selection procedure are documented in Protocol ATLAS.

Users of SCP-150-DE may not enter the public and have to remain in Foundation sites outside of deployment. Families of subjects, if existing, will be informed of their death and receive all Foundation benefits due in these circumstances. Potential candidates are to be informed about these conditions, as well as the following surgeries for the usage of SCP-150-DE and the subsequent psychological changes before the selection procedure and have to agree to them in written form.

SCP-150-DE users are to be assigned to MTF DE4-𝔙 "Die Verteidiger" (i.e. "The Defenders") and are lent to other MTFs only when necessary. To this end, MTF DE4-𝔙 is to be stationed at multiple sites. MTF DE4-𝔙 itself may out only move out in extreme situations, like a containment breach of an extremely dangerous anomaly or to prevent an imminent K-class scenario. On missions, SCP-150-DE instances are to be transported exclusively via police trucks or helicopter and, when practical, only to be deployed at sites where a public witnessing isn't possible. Should a discrete operation not be possible, witnesses are to be amnesticized and media depicting these objects to be censored. Alternatively, if applicable, they can be presented as advertisements for the video game //Counter Shock//, which is being developed and marketed by the Foundation front company Superior Console Performance.

SCP-150-DE users must subject themselves to monthly tests to analyze their psyche. Should a user become unstable, they are to be decommissioned and to be classified as Class-E personnel until a decision regarding further steps has been reached. Acceptable methods in this regard are psychological therapy with subsequent employment as security personnel of the respective site, incarceration or, in emergencies, termination.    

Should an SCP-150-DE user expire, their remains are to be properly interred and the materials of his SCP-150-DE instance to be returned to the production cycle after thorough study. 

If they are not being studied, instances of SCP-150-DE-Α[[footnote]]A is this case stands for the Greek letter Alpha.[[/footnote]] and SCP-150-DE-Ω are to be disassembled and locked within medium value containment lockers.

If instances of SCP-150-DE-Α or SCP-150-DE-Ω are encountered outside of the Foundation, they are to be confiscated or, upon retaliation, to be neutralized using heavy kinetic energy penetrators or other suitable weapons. The information in this paragraph is to be relayed to all agents involved in combat missions, regardless of the classification of this document.  

**Description:** SCP-150-DE describes a series of Tactical Power Armors with anomalous properties. All currently stored or used models encase their wearer completely and make them capable of greater performance than that possible for a normal human. Some technologies used were until now not completely understood by the Foundation, although a great part of them is reproducible. 

**Discovery:** Since 1995, the Foundation conducts research to create a functional exoskeleton for combat missions, medical treatment, and logistics. The first non-anomalous models were finished in the year 2000, but there were several problems regarding their carrying capacity and their energy supply, rendering them unsuited for practical applications. 

In 2001, the Foundation took notice of the technology of Raptor Tec. Industries and showed great interest in their Tactical Combat Armors. They weren’t capable of enhancing the performance capability of their users and to suppress their emotions, but also possessed haptic sensors on all surfaces and could be equipped with different weapon systems, such as grenade launchers, cannons, or lasers. Additionally, they provided reliable protection against several environmental influences and could be linked with the neural system of their wearer, allowing support of all actions undertaken by an inbuilt AI. At this time, the Foundation didn't know that Raptor Tec. Industries worked with anomalies and was obligated by contract to not research their products. For this reason, the power armor did not get an SCP classification and wasn’t studied. They were successfully deployed several times in controlled environments but were only used once in the field.  

During Incident [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/028-de-i2 #028-DE/I2], the Foundation took possession of several Tactical Power Armors of the [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/skp-portal SKP], residing in a parallel universe. At the same time, their obvious anomalous properties came to light, it was also noted that R.T.I.-Armors possessed capabilities unexplainable by the Foundation, as for example the temporary prevention of the death of a fatally wounded user and the forced take over us his body by the integrated AI. Raptor Tec. Industries were subsequently ordered to surrender to the Foundation and to hand over their anomalous technologies. Following this, the company went into hiding and from then on kept acting from the underground. Its armors were classified as SCP-150-DE-A, while the captured models of the SKP gained the designation SCP-150-DE-Ω.

The replication of these technologies proved difficult in the beginning until computer technicians from Site-DE03 managed to download big parts of the SKP database from R-3379-DE. While the Foundation is still not capable of understanding the basic principles of most technologies, it managed to replicate them after initial difficulties. 

While technologies like the required servomotors and general construction could be replicated one-to-one, problems arose in creating the required materials, amongst other things. R.T.I. and the SKP used materials with structures, which could be produced not at all, only with great effort or only with high material costs. Foundation engineers were capable of substituting these materials with normal ones in most cases, but this resulted in lowered performance and resilience. For the bigger part, they could help themselves on this matter with data collected from files of Section XXV by Research Team 25, also in cases were the usage of normal materials wasn’t feasible. Section XXV too had searched for stronger, lighter and especially easy to produce materials to counteract the constant shortage of resources in the GDR, basing themselves on documents of the SKP formerly residing in this universe, amongst others. 

Another problem was posed by the supply with energy. R.T.I. used a currently for replication insufficiently analyzed accumulator, while the SKP relied on a motor, whose reverse engineered Foundation prototypes don’t operate stably at this time. This obstacle could be overcome with the aid of [[[SCP-156-DE]]], which delivered information on the construction and cost-effective production of glass batteries.  

Since the neuronal connection of SCP-150-DE-Α or SCP-150-DE-Ω could not be replicated until recently, pressure sensors on the armors inside were initially used to move the armor with the wearer. However, that resulted in unwanted oscillations.

> **Foreword:** In this test, the third try was undertaken to get SCP-150-DE components to mimic their wearer's movements. The test subject is a D-Class personnel, whose right arm is inserted up to the shoulder in an SCP-150-DE prototype (It is a glove with the corresponding arm) fixed to a frame to not burden the test subject with the weight. The test is being conducted by Dr. Kulzer in a standard testing chamber in Site-DE12. Medical personnel is available on call.

> - Dr. Kulzer, Robotics Department

In the end, pressure sensors were discarded. The approach of a neuronal connection by R.T.I. and the SKP proved itself to be to complex for the Foundation engineers. Instead, the technological enhancements of members of the [http://www.scp-wiki.net/church-of-the-broken-god-hub Church of Maxwellism] were studied and replicated for the use as control elements for SCP-150-DE. These elements establish a neuronal connection between humans and machines, similar to SCP-150-DE-A and SCP-150-DE-Ω, and enabled the exchange of information between both. Input from SCP-150-DE is directly projected into the mind of the wearer. In opposition to the original, the ports developed by the Foundation have to be surgically implanted into the user's body and connected to its central nervous system. 

[[include component:image-block name=http://scp-int.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-150-de/surgery_surgeons_operation_medical_health_doctors_human_table-709372.jpg!d.jpg|caption=Agent Häusler during one of the operations preparing him for the use of SCP-150-DE.|width=300px]]

For these implants, users have to subject themselves to several surgical procedures. The ports are located at:
* Both temples
* Below the shoulder between the shoulder blades 
* Ca. 1 cm below the thorax at the spine
* Ca. 1 cm above the pelvis at the spine
 
After tests with Class-D personnel had been concluded, the first models of SCP-150-DE were presented. Due to the composition of their materials, the machines with a hight between 2 and 2,3 m are not as heavily armored and efficient as the originals, but about 100 kg lighter, enabling them to reach the same velocities. The first models could be operated for three hours, a duration that could be expanded widely since then. The armors can be equipped with weapons which, depending on the model, can be attached at the arms, the hip, the shoulders and/or the back. An interface helps to acquire and attack targets, to navigate, to coordinate with others and to register their status. In addition, infrared vision allows navigating in total darkness, although the models do not possess haptic sensors. For deployment in areas hostile to life, all SCP-150-DE instances seal themselves hermetically, additionally, every unit carries a supply of oxygen that lasts for ca. 20 minutes and in some models up to one hour. If it isn't used, a ventilation system supplies the user with air and cools him down if necessary. With the exception of the application of stimulants, SCP-150-DE possesses no functions for keeping his wearer combat-ready, including means of medical supply. 

Due to the limited storage capacity of the storage media inside the armor, a less efficient AI had to be used as employed by SCP-150-DE-A or -Ω, even though research in this avenue is still being conducted. This AI is capable of identifying and neutralizing cognitohazards before they can take effect. It is, however, incapable of communicating with its wearer and watch the surroundings in his stead, forcing wearers to actively decide what they want to see on their interface. To circumvent this problem a little, all instances SCP-150-DE possess a proximity alert, warning of incoming projectiles and units. The exact technical specifications can be taken from Technology Report 150-DE/98T.

Wearers of instances of SCP-150-DE have demonstrated several remarkable feats, such as:
* Breaking through 50 cm thick concrete walls via ramming 
* Maintaining a constant speed of 60 km/h for a duration of 90 minutes
* One SCP-150-DE user eliminating and/or overpowering 11 hostile units with equipment similar to the American military standard 
* Lifting ca. 340 kg of weight
* Repelling hacker attacks directed towards the armor through the dual system of human and machine
* Continued combat readiness 72 hours (with recharging of energy reserves in regular intervals)

Several models of SCP-150-DE were developed, designed for different tasks. [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/document-150-de-argonaut Document 150-DE/ARGONAUT] contains a list of all models currently being produced. 

To equip SCP-150-DE the armors and the helmets are opened by electrical servo motors. Then, the user has to enter SCP-150-DE, causing the device to seal itself hermetically. Attention should be paid to the user wearing special turnout gear that does not cover the ports on the body, so the machine can connect with the subject.

Probably because the controls of SCP-150-DE rely heavily on the brain of its wearer, the psyche of its users slowly transforms because the brain tries the accommodate for the unusual requirements This transformation leads to an improvement of analytical thinking, environmental perception, multitasking and reaction speed but at the same time impairs emotional reactions and empathy to the point of complete suppression. Subjects also will after a while to wear SCP-150-DE as often as possible, presumably because the brain adapts to the conditions of the armor and not fully readjusts to the stimuli outside of SCP-150-DE. Because of that, candidates for which SCP-150-DE instances are to be created, are to be informed about the side-effects to rule out later disobedience as good as possible.

> I had five victims of SCP-150-DE in evaluation for a while now and I am using the word victim deliberately. Those armors take the humanities of their wearers. They become more like robots, drilled to fulfill their task as fast and effectively as possible. At this point, they are no more than the machines they wear. I urgently suggest we do something against that, to decrease the load those armors burden their wearers with. Otherwise, we also can right away view the Verteidigers not just as dead on paper. 
> //- Dr. Stier, Psychology Department//

Usually, the psychological change proceeds without incident, but in rare cases the subject develops split personalities, catatonia ore paranoia, presumed to be a defensive reaction of the own psyche against the change. Five such cases are known to date of which three became violent. Especially Incident 150-DE/017Z, which occurred on a mission, resulted in 13 causalities, among them seven Foundation employees. 

> We have gained increased complaints from the Psychology Departments of some sites because of the condition of the SCP-150-DE users. I have to agree in the regard that we indeed put together a bunch of psychopaths and they are one of the strongest MTF we have. They are //now// loyal but what if more than one goes postal or a rebellion is planned? 
> //- O4-2//

> Our technology is just not enough to enable the same form of controls like R.T.I. and the SKP use them, although we are working on that. And even if they are psychopaths, they are, as you mentioned correctly, one of our strongest MTFs and according to calculations still not capable to go toe to toe with SCP-150-DE-A und -Ω and prevail. And that are surely not all threats that the creators of those power armors can throw at us. We need more of them. I will request the Mother Foundation to lend us a few [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2000 Hominid Replicators], so we can circumvent this lengthy selection process. Also, I view the use of evidence enforcing memes or, if everything fails, [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2140 SCP-2140] for adequate to prevent an uprising.
