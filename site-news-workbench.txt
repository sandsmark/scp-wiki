@@@@
The OCT, or, [[[scp-oct-hub | Original Character Contest]]], was created by [[*user PeppersGhost]] to encourage some community fun. Every contestant entered with a character of their own creation to be paired against another contestant in a tale. Fighting, drinking, hanging out, nothing was off the table so long as it starred both parties equally. Though many entered, only one will win. The first two rounds have come and gone, so let's take a look at the matchups!

= [[size 250%]]**Fun contest facts!**[[/size]]
@@@@
This contest has brought out all sorts of characters from different walks of life, meaning that different Groups/Persons of Interest appearing was inevitable. Let's take a look at which G/PoI's came out to play!

* from [[[dado-hub | dado's fine laundry and tan]]] is dado himself yes
* From [[[wilson-s-wildlife-solutions-hub | Wilson's Wildlife Solutions]]] hail [[[ringo | Ringo]]], [[[critter-profile-wobbles | Wobbles]]], and [[[critter-profile-maya | Maya]]], some of the wildest contestants yet!
* [[[critter-profile-wobbles | Wobbles]]], [[[ringo | Ringo]]], and [[[maya-the-magnificent | Maya the Magnificent]]] have ties to other GoI; The Shark Punching Center , [[[chaos-insurgency-hub | The Chaos Insurgency]]] and [[[herman-fuller-hub | Herman Fuller's Circus of the Disquieting]]] respectively. 
* [[[danger-in-the-manger | Heather Mason]]], otherwise known as 'Ms. Mad About Video Games' is a [[[gamers-against-weed-hub | GAW]]] affiliated anomaly. 
* [[[SCP-4799 | Shock]]] has indirect ties to the [[[goc-hub-page | Global Occult Coalition.]]]

Since we're looking at the backgrounds of some characters, why not take a look and see what kind of article they came from as well?

* [[[the-summer-of-bad-memories | Ruslav Diaghilev]]], [[[slice-of-life | Tyrone]]], and [[[ethics | Agent Johnson]]] come from Tales. 
* [[[ringo | Ringo]]], [[[critter-profile-wobbles | Wobbles]]], and [[[critter-profile-maya | Maya]]] all originated from GoI Format articles, with the lattermost even having a [[[maya-the-magnificent | double feature premiere!]]]
* [[[scp-wow-j | Dr. Fynegan]]] is the only contestant originating from a Joke article. 
* All other contestants originated from a main-list SCP article.

Assorted fun facts
* [[[a-romantic-comedy-starring-a-dead-mosquito-guest-starring-th| Let Her Heart DEET Once More]]] - by [[*user OthellotheCat]] was the first OCT entry posted in the contest.
* [[[the-antihero-by-dado| the antihero by dado]]] - by [[*user djkaktus]] was the last Round 1 OCT article posted.
* Four entries used custom CSS themes, including [[[a-bearly-thought-out-plan| A Bear-ly Thought Out Plan]]] which uses the WWS Theme, [[[the-abyss-gazes-back| The Abyss Gazes Back (And It's ASCII On A CRT Screen)]]] uses the Pataphysics Theme, and [[[tyrone-joins-the-family| Tyrone Joins the Family]]] and [[[cater-duty| Cater Duty]]] both use the Spicy Crust Pizza theme.
* Nine contestants (Maya, Gunhead Anomalocaris, Wobbles, Ringo, poky, Leslie, Tree Critter, Robber Ducks, Buddy, and Anoati) are non-humanoids. 
* Two entrants (Robber Ducks and poky) are more than one character, with poky bringing The Great Carnegias along for the ride, and Robber Ducks consisting of five separate entities. 
* The Plague Doctor is the oldest contestant in the OCT, with SCP-049 being posted on the 10th of December 2009.
* In contrast; The Great Anoati is the youngest entrant, with SCP-3416 having been posted on the 24th of August 2018.
* [[*user newyrose]] made custom Snapchat CSS for use in [[[grin-and-bear-it| Grin and Bear It]]] and [[[a-bearly-thought-out-plan| A Bear-ly Thought Out Plan.]]] She did an excellent job! 
* [[[prehistoric-artillery-strike| Derailment By Prehistoric Artillery Strike]]] and [[[trilobastards| Trilobites: Many Reasons To Kill Them, and 0 Reasons Not To]]] are both tagged with 'interactive', meaning there's listpages magic afoot!
* [[[grin-and-bear-it| Grin and Bear It]]] and [[[a-bearly-thought-out-plan| A Bear-ly Thought Out Plan]]] tell a continuous story, and are the only Round 1 tales with a chronological order between contestants. 
* There were not one, but two ties in the contest, meaning there will be two three-way character meetings next round, not counting the Bonus Round contestants. 
* Nine Round 1 tale titles are puns. We'll let you figure out which ones they are. 
* Two Round 2 tales are song title references. 
* [[*user othellothecat]] was the first entrant to post their entry in Round 2. Fast fingers on this one!
* [[*user othellothecat]] and [[*user gabriel jade]] tied again, this time [[*user the great hippo]] tied as well leading to the first three-way tie of the contest!
* [[[the-scent-of-a-toaster| The Scent of a Toaster]]] marks the start of the second season of [[[bird|Team Bird's]]] Doomcon canon!

[[*user Varaxous]]
> [http://www.scp-wiki.net/poky-ch-arms Poky ChArms] - Call me biased, but I love [[size 75%]]poky[[/size]] and I love armando. [[*user Weryllium]] manages to bring out the best of both of the characters in, as is customary, a wild ride.

> [http://www.scp-wiki.net/snapchat-trilobash-cannon-fire-can-t-fix-everything Snapchat Trilobash (Cannon Fire Can't Fix Everything)] - Speaking of wild rides, this one is the perfect example of one. It's got action, it's anomalcaris, it's got dead trilobites. Probably my favorite entry into the OCT.

[[*user Uncle Nicolini]]
> [[[grin-and-bear-it| Grin and Bear It]]] is probably my favorite of the entire round. Not only do we get to explore 3009-C and see a kinder side to the Foundation, but we also get a field trip to the Wilson Terrestrial Center! Excellent use of CSS, beautiful characterization and loving attention to detail come together to make this an easy pick for a highlight.
> 
> [[[incorrective-unconsciousness| incorrective unconsciousness]]] is a gorgeous display of prose and character moments, I highly recommend it.

You will notice little '📈' emojis besides some articles. That denotes SCP articles which were under 30 and tales which were under 20 when this edition of site news was posted. Give them a little love! Speaking from personal experience, the most frustrating thing that can happen to an article is not deletion, but stagnating below 20 without any comments. So try to read, vote, and comment on these articles! They're often hidden gems :)

+* Q&A:

++* Q: Can I replace a blurb that you wrote for one of my articles with my own? I'm not satisfied with it.

A: Absolutely. You will always have that option at any point.

++* Q: I noticed an error/typo/incorrect information and wish to correct it. May I?

A: Sure! If the changes are not limited to your own article(s) and/or are substantial changes across multiple entries, you should post in that month's discussion page and then make the changes.

++* Q: I wrote an article and it seems to have stuck. Can I send a blurb of mine to one of the frequent collaborators?

A: Yup! It's much easier if you come to us about it, and it gives you the control over what you want shown on the news page.
