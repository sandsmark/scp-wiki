You will notice little 'üìà' emojis beside some articles. That denotes SCP articles which were under 30 and tales which were under 20 when this edition of site news was posted. Give them a little love! Speaking from personal experience, the most frustrating thing that can happen to an article is not deletion, but stagnating below 20 without any comments. So try to read, vote, and comment on these articles! They're often hidden gems :)

* [[[a-bold-choice| A Bold Choice]]] - "You know my standards, you know how I feel about things, even if you don't agree. But while you're saying I won't want any part in this, you're also trying to convince me to join you. What's the point?" Written by [[*user Calibri Bold]].
* [[[four-sides-of-the-same-imaginary-coin| Four Sides of the Same Imaginary Coin]]] - "Test was undertaken as a component of CIA Collaborative Project "JAL√ú", designed to serve as a power conduit by feeding off the brainwaves of higher-dimensional entities." Written by [[*user TheHouseOfBalloons]].
* [[[disconnect| Disconnect]]] - "I do not know who you are that reads this. To list those who I feel might eventually set eyes on these pages would become strangely exclusionary to those that actually do that are inevitably not listed here, and so I will refrain." A new installment for the //What a Wonderful World// and //Those Twisted Pines// canons, written by [[*user DarkStuff]].
* [[[a-history-of-the-arcadia-logo| A History of the Arcadia Logo]]] - "Mr. Bushnell likes to say he created it, but really calling him the "founder" is all you need to say." Written by [[*user JackalRelated]].
* [[[alto-clef-jr-doorcrasher| Alto Clef Jr.: Day of the Doorcrasher]]] - "Dealing with full-on robots and androids can be more complicated. They emulate human eccentricities, and some of their programming is predictable, but they're not subject to the same physical limitations. They can be built with stronger frames, tougher muscles or faster reflexes. Maybe their CPU isn't in their cranium at all!" Written by [[*user Tsercele]].
* [[[serus| Serus]]] - Because updates are gud. Still written by [[*user Roget]], with now, the fancy artworks of [[*user UncertaintyCrossing]].
* [[[carnivores| Carnivores]]] - "John and Bailey were seated at a table right in the middle of the restaurant. The couple stared at each other for a moment. Each looking for signals that everything was ok. Bailey was used to getting this look from John." A new installment for the //End of Death// canon, written by [[*user Captain Kirby]].

++++* GoI Formats

* [[[the-eschaton| Serpent Bound \\\ BEAR WITNESS]]] - [Serpent's Hand] "The Eschaton was the de-materialization of all guests to the Library, occurring after 1,143,837,925 Cycles, in midday. Since this time, no individual has entered the Library or attempted to contact the Head Librarian. As a result, twelve million loaned books are currently marked Overdue." Written by [[*user Nagiros]].
* [[[sc-48-404-97-786| SC-48/404-97/786]]] - [Chaos Insurgency] "When the beast is slain, and the deed is done, the hero will lie by the hearth of Hestia. Then what would a quest be without a home to return to?" Written by [[*user Ethagon]].

++++* Misc
* [[[niram-art| Niram's Gallery]]] - Hey, have you heard the news ? There's these paintings about Sarkics who will be shown in a few days. And the artist responsible for this will be present. I don't know their name... it's [[*user niram]], I think.
* [[[yuannn-s-artwork-page| YUANNN's Artwork Page]]] - [[*user YUANNN]] is responsible for the sudden cat rain of today, but don't bother too much. All these cats and animals are pretty cute.

+* Q&A:

++* Q: Can I replace a blurb that you wrote for one of my articles with my own? I'm not satisfied with it.

A: Absolutely. You will always have that option at any point.

++* Q: I noticed an error/typo/incorrect information and wish to correct it. May I?

A: Sure! If the changes are not limited to your own article(s) and/or are substantial changes across multiple entries, you should post in that month's discussion page and then make the changes.

++* Q: I wrote an article and it seems to have stuck. Can I send a blurb of mine to one of the frequent collaborators?

A: Yup! It's much easier if you come to us about it, and it gives you the control over what you want shown on the news page.
