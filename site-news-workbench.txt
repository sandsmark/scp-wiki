* [https://www.reddit.com/r/SCP/comments/9mkms3/hi_this_should_be_the_first_iteration_of_the/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=new&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=SCP SCP-173 Original 4chan post] - This cropped up on reddit this month and caused a bit of a stir, with good reason. As it implies, this is the closest thing we have to original 4chan thread for SCP-173 and some of the other objects. Check it out!
* [[[and-then-i-died-series-2| And Then I Died IV - Series 2]]] - [[*user Shaggydredlocks]] restarted this old game! The premise is simple: someone writes a small entry ending with 'and then I died' featuring a single SCP and you guess what SCP did the killing! If you guess correctly, then it's your turn to write an entry. We're eleven entries in so far and this last one seems to be quite the head scratcher. Go and give it a go!
* [[[SCP International]]] - The International Wiki has teamed up with us to post some of their best articles over the month of October, with the last being posted in November! They have a hub but we've also made a collection of the articles posted at the bottom of this page. Go check it out!

++++* Featured Articles

* [[[SCP-2232]]] ("Birdphone. Think Different."), by [[*user minmin]], a quick look at Birdphone!â„¢ the next logical step following carrier pigeons.
* [/CryogenChaos-Comment-Tales CryogenChaos' Comment Tales], by, you guessed it, [[*user CryogenChaos]], A collection of neat gems hidden in the comments of other SCPs.
* In [/the-dark-web-dke79-o2rg5-4jlw6 'The Dark Web' (DKE79/O2RG5/4JLW6)], by [[*user drchandra]], MC&D make their first venture into the wonderful world of THE CLOUD! 


++++* Event Featured Articles

The theme for the month of October was //Shadow!//

* In [[[SCP-2524]]] ("No Strings"), by [[*user tygently]], a wax candle has a bit of fun with the Foundation.
* In [[[SCP-1806]]] ("Shadow Sculpture"), by [[*user sandrewswann]], we see what happens when your shadow crosses over the path of true darkness.
* In [[[SCP-1553]]] ("Dr. Wondertainment's Shadow Paint Play-Set!"), by [[*user fortunefavorsbold]], leave shadow puppets behind with shadow paint! (Note: may cause fatigue, vomiting, and fading into the void.)

You will notice little 'ðŸ“ˆ' emojis besides some articles. That denotes SCP articles which were under 30 and tales which were under 20 when this edition of site news was posted. Give them a little love! Speaking from personal experience, the most frustrating thing that can happen to an article is not deletion, but stagnating below 20 without any comments. So try to read, vote, and comment on these articles! They're often hidden gems :)

+* Q&A:

++* Q: Can I replace a blurb that you wrote for one of my articles with my own? I'm not satisfied with it.

A: Absolutely. You will always have that option at any point.

++* Q: I noticed an error/typo/incorrect information and wish to correct it. May I?

A: Sure! If the changes are not limited to your own article(s) and/or are substantial changes across multiple entries, you should post in that month's discussion page and then make the changes.

++* Q: I wrote an article and it seems to have stuck. Can I send a blurb of mine to one of the frequent collaborators?

A: Yup! It's much easier if you come to us about it, and it gives you the control over what you want shown on the news page.[[/size]]
