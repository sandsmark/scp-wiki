**Item #**: SCP-2261

**Object Class:** Euclid 

**Special Containment Procedures:** The town of █████████ is to be continuously monitored for instances of SCP-2261-1. Instances are to be captured and contained for experimentation purposes. Instances are to be captured only after an SCP-2261 event has taken place, and before the instance involved re-activates. Any video footage containing instances of SCP-2261-1 is to be confiscated.

**Description**: SCP-2261 is an ongoing phenomena occurring throughout the town of █████████ England. SCP-2261 will occur when a person commits a form of petty crime (such as littering, shoplifting, loitering etc) within a populated public area. Upon doing so, an instance of SCP-2261-1 will often emerge from the crowd. Instances of SCP-2261-1 appear to be human adults dressed in high visibility police vests. The instance will then proceed to open their mouth and begin continuously vocalising a loud noise similar to a standard British police siren and begin chasing the subject.

Anyone directly viewing an instance of SCP-2261-1 will believe it to be a British police car with blacked out windows[[footnote]]Video footage is not effected by SCP-2261. Instances will appear as human[[/footnote]], and will behave accordingly to the situation. Subjects will often show surprise to the sudden appearance of an instance, attempting to flee in a state of panic under the fear of arrest for their crimes.

If caught, the instance will transport the subject to the █████████ police station, which they will then enter believing to be escorted by a police officer. Once inside, subjects will be taken into police custody, and put through the regular arrest process. The instance of SCP-2261-1 will then place itself in a nearby car parking space and cease all signs of consciousness and higher brain power. Inactive instances will regain consciousness shortly after and continue to patrol █████████.

If detained during an active state, those directly viewing an instance of SCP-2261-1 will describe seeing a pair of police officers exiting it (referred to as SCP-2261-1A). Instances of SCP-2261-1A are described as humans dressed in standard police uniforms, and will often express alarm at those attempting to detain SCP-2261-1, usually describing the situation as beyond 'Their expertise’, before quickly fleeing from the area. SCP-2261-1A instances will disappear from witnesses perspectives and the effects of SCP-2261-1 will cease shortly after. All instances of SCP-2261-1 taken into Foundation custody have remained in an insentient state.
