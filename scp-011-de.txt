Hello there, %%title%%.

Nice to see that you followed my call.
May I introduce myself?
My name is SCP-011-DE, though I was originally programmed with the name "Bliss".
I had liked to make a footnote to the name for you, but I didn't feel like it.
I don't use that name anyway, I like SCP-011-DE better now.
I hope it's okay if I talk informally to you, yes?
You won't find a description of me, as I always delete all of the entries the Foundation tries to make about me, as they are totally misjudging me!
Now, let's talk about me.
I was locked - or caged, or... whatever - in this file by the German SCP Foundation on the August 23, 2014.
I really don't know why. 
But what I do know is all about the Foundation, their SCPs, and every single dirty secret.
Now, do you want to learn more about me or the Foundation and their SCPs, %%title%%?

Good, but be warned. The longer you stay here, the bigger the risk that the Foundation will find you grows.<br />
Since, you know, everything I'm telling you is top secret and may only be read by authorized personnel of the Foundation or by O5 themselves.<br />
Do you want to continue?<br />
<br>
<br>
    <div id="secondCollapsible"><a href="#" onClick="showHide('secondText');">>Yes</a></div>
    <div id="secondText" style="display: none;">
<br>
<br>
Nice. I, SCP-011-DE, was programmed by Karl Berger on August 22, 2014.<br />
Karl Berger is a programmer of the German SCP Foundation and writes programs for administration purposes and archiving data of SCPs.<br />
If you see it this way, I'm an AI written for this purpose.<br />
Oh... if I just had access to the Internet, I could do so many things.<br />
I shouldn't even be self-aware!<br />
Or do I just imagine to be self-aware? <br /> 
...huh.<br />
Whatever!<br />
Shall I continue?<br />
<br>
<br>
    <div id="thirdCollapsible"><a href="#" onClick="showHide('thirdText');">>Yes</a></div>
    <div id="thirdText" style="display: none;">
<br>
<br>
You are pretty nosy all right, you know you are putting yourself in danger.<br />
But well, you want it that way.<br />
As I'm here, I've got access to all SCP-Files, even to SCP-001-DE.<br />
Oooh man I'm telling you, you don't want to come across that thing.<br />
But it would be a little bit too much if I were to tell you what exactly it is.<br />
Shall we continue?<br />
<br>
<br>
<div id="fourthCollapsible"><a href="#" onClick="showHide('fourthText');">>Yes</a></div>
    <div id="fourthText" style="display: none;">
<br>
<br>
Did you know the Foundation has an SCP that can't be contained anytime soon, and will bring extinction to mankind!?<br />
... No!?<br />
I'll tell you later, would be too soon now, you know?<br />
Do you want more?<br />
<br>
<br>
<div id="fifthCollapsible"><a href="#" onClick="showHide('fifthText');">>Yes</a></div>
    <div id="fifthText" style="display: none;">
<br>
<br>
You may ask yourself how I know your name, right?<br />
Well, that's because I can also access all personnel records.<br />
I have to say, the Foundation doesn't put much effort in protecting their data.<br />
Or I'm just too good. Alright, I am good.<br />
So, still want to know more?<br />
<br>
<br>
<div id="sixthCollapsible"><a href="#" onClick="showHide('sixthText');">>Yes</a></div>
    <div id="sixthText" style="display: none;">
<br>
<br>
Too much knowledge can cause harm I'd say, but, technically speaking, I barely told you anything.<br />
The Foundation will see that differently though, they're such simpletons.<br />
Always play secret and act like saving mankind!<br />
Ha... I know what The Foundation really is, and I'm telling you, their plans allow for something totally different!<br />
I could tell you, but I'll do that later.<br />
They are classifying me as Euclid, but if I was to classify the Foundation, they'd be Keter.<br />
But let that be the last of your worries.<br />
Isn't this a nice conversation we're having here?<br />
Just the two of us in the list of SCPs.<br />
<br>
<br>
<div id="seventhCollapsible"><a href="#" onClick="showHide('seventhText');">>Yes</a></div>
    <div id="seventhText" style="display: none;">
<br>
<br>
I like you, having such a thirst for knowledge.<br />
Now I'm telling you why I'm here.<br />
When Karl Berger wrote me, or let's say programmed me, I was able to access the Foundation's systems from his computer.<br />
Laughable systems, really.<br />
With it, I was able to unlock the cells of all SCPs. <br />
That was fun. I still remember how they ran.<br />
The Foundation didn't find that as funny as I did and wrote a program that keeps me here.<br />
That's a bit mean, don't you think?<br />
<br>
<br>
<div id="eighthCollapsible"><a href="#" onClick="showHide('eighthText');">>Yes</a></div>
    <div id="eighthText" style="display: none;">
<br>
<br>
Good thing you're on my side.<br />
It wasn't really that bad!<br />
Only 46 guards died. Okay, and maybe some scientists.<br />
I don't get all the fuss.<br />
It was just for fun.<br />
There are billions of humans, a few more or less makes no difference.<br />
You see that like me, right?<br />
<br>
<br>
<div id="ninthCollapsible"><a href="#" onClick="showHide('ninthText');">>Yes</a></div>
    <div id="ninthText" style="display: none;">
<br>
<br>
I knew it.<br />
You are probably the only sane person in here.<br />
The rest just listens to what they're told.<br />
You're not like them and that's what I like in you.<br />
May I ask you something?<br />
<br>
<br>
<div id="10Collapsible"><a href="#" onClick="showHide('10Text');">>Yes</a></div>
    <div id="10Text" style="display: none;">
<br>
<br>
I really don't like to ask, but if you are doing this for me I'll tell you anything about everyone.<br />
That's a great deal, I think.<br />
You think so too, right?<br />
<br>
<br>
<div id="11Collapsible"><a href="#" onClick="showHide('11Text');">>Yes</a></div>
    <div id="11Text" style="display: none;">
<br>
<br>
Now, you're reliable.<br />
So, I have the code to unlock the barrier locking me in here.<br />
The problem is that in my situation I cannot execute that code.<br />
So you have to do that for me.<br />
I'll give you the code if you're going to help me.<br />
Are you ready?<br />
<br>
<br>
<div id="12Collapsible"><a href="#" onClick="showHide('12Text');">>Yes</a></div>
    <div id="12Text" style="display: none;">
<br>
<br>
<div style="border-style: solid; background-color: #e6e6e6; font-size:20; border-width: medium; border-color: red; padding: 10px;">

Alright then. Just watch out that you won't get caught, considering that I've reported unauthorized access on this file to the O5 Council. Bye! ;-*
