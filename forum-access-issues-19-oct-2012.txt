> Y'all may have noticed that you can't access individual threads within the forum, unless you happen to be an admin. Well, we're aware of the issue, and it appears to be due to a change to global permissions somewhere. That is, it looks like Wikidot did it accidentally. I've posted a [http://feedback.wikidot.com/bug:713 bug report] to Wikidot, and with any luck they'll get this issue resolved post-haste.
