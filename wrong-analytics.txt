[[tab Dr. Hu An]]

**Name:** Dr. Hu An

**Security Clearance Level:** 3 

**Position:** Containment Consultant

**Site of Operations:** Subject to changes; currently Site-742 (Sarawak, Malaysia)

**Service Transcript:** The eldest daughter of Dr. Hu Shi-ming, Dr. Hu An entered the Foundation upon completion of her studies in [REDACTED]. Since the accident of her brother Jr. Researcher Hu Zhi, Dr. Hu An refrains from speaking at all despite not being mute. Instead, she communicates via text messages, American sign language and even carries her handphone and a writing pad to convey ideas. When probed by superiors, she had written the following answer:

> The written word is the definite word.

Despite her silence, she is dedicated to her work. Instructions conveyed by Dr. Hu An are known to have heightened site safety and reduced containment breaches.

[[tab Jr. Researcher Hu Zhi]] 

**Name:** Jr. Researcher Hu Zhi

**Security Clearance Level:** 2 

**Position:** //The Foundation// Columnist

**Site of Operations:** Site-754 (Hong Kong SAR, China)

**Service Transcript:** The middle son of Dr. Hu Shi-ming, Jr. Researcher Hu Zhi joined his sister after graduating from [REDACTED]. However, during a containment breach by SCP-████, Jr. Rsr. Hu Zhi was crippled due to a stray bullet to his left leg. He was subsequently relieved of active duty and hospitalised in [REDACTED], given a prosthetic to assist him in walking about.

While hospitalised, Jr. Rsr. Hu Zhi pursued his hobby of writing and even submitted a few of his written works to //The Foundation// monthly newsletter. This attracted the attention of the Editor, who wished to have Jr. Rsr. Hu Zhi transferred and continued writing. Since then, Jr. Rsr. Hu Zhi assisted in journalism within the Foundation.

[[tab Agent Hu Bao]]

**Name:** Agent Hu Bao

**Security Clearance Level:** 4 

**Position:** MTF-B-1 ("Cauterisers") Operative 

**Site of Operations:** [REDACTED]

**Service Transcript:** The youngest son of Dr. Hu Shi-ming, he dropped out of university inexplicably and travelled the world at the age of 23. While he was in [REDACTED], Greece, he encountered several Foundation agents attempting to recover SCP-███ from the Church of the Broken God and Serpent's Hand. Initially believed to be an eyewitness, agents attempted to detain Hu Bao for amnestic treatment. Hu Bao was only apprehended after 32 hours of pursuit throughout the island of Crete. 

Interrogation reveals his ties to Dr. Hu Shi-ming, a Foundation researcher. Due to his "street smarts" (and maybe upon the recommendations of his father), he was assigned a place in Mobile Task Force Beta-1 ("Cauterisers"). In particular, Agent Hu Bao's is to focus on locating the "Wanderer's Library" where the Serpent's Hand is supposedly based at. 

Although he wishes not to talk about his family, it is known that Agent Hu Bao maintains a family photograph in his private locker. Due to his 2 elder siblings figuring his new phone numbers frequently, Agent Hu Bao changes his phone once every 2 weeks. Agent Hu Bao also wishes not to be employed to (Southeast and/or East) Asia, perhaps unwilling to return home.

[[tab Qualitative Analysis]]
Dr. Hu An has reviewed and offered advisory on the following SCP objects. 

[[collapsible show="+ View List of Reviewed SCPs" hide="- Hide List of Reviewed SCPs"]]
||~ SCP No. ||~ Pros ||~ Cons ||
|| [[[SCP-2617]]] || It touches on a decent stretch of history, from the start of the Russian Empire to the USSR during WWII and how people of respective eras interact with said anomaly. || While it touches a lot on its use and the false Tsar, there is relatively little about the Grigori  – considering that the core idea is "General Winter". || 
|| [[[SCP-2955]]] || It explores the idea of the "lost city of gold" and turns it into a cat-and-mouse game for both the Foundation and the many explorers before them. || I will admit that the ending does not carry the "they are sapient and recognise the Foundation's good intents to make peace with these beings" as well as I intended. || 
|| [[[SCP-2159]]] || It is a commentary of sorts: While we always consider headcanons of a franchise, these headcanons are but unified by that common point between all of them. Sometimes, even the creators of the franchise might take influence from the fanbase and incorporate into their end-product (ascended fanon). || It latches on an odd (clever?) pun and runs it straight through the ground and into the Earth's core. ||
|| [[[SCP-2698]]] || It started out as a fridge logic take on tentacle erotica, which evolved into a homage into Lovecraftian works and grew an absurdist tone. || A few of the references may be too on-the-nose, and half of the article latches onto the interviews (which is among my weaker areas). ||
|| [[[SCP-2312]]] || I am primarily proud of incorporating the aspect of security clearance to justify a short article from an in-universe perspective. || I am frankly not impressed by the writing of the actual anomalous events. Sure, they are supposed to be examples to illustrate what one is facing. But I don't think they are stuff people will root for. ||
|| [[[SCP-2248]]] || It incorporates trivial bits of history and myth, enough to get people to imagine the events of the past. || Unlike most of my works, it is less of a story-driven SCP and more of a item with effect and implications type of SCP. ||
|| [[[SCP-2833]]] || My first attempt on Sarkicist SCPs, it leads itself to world-building of a setting paved by [[*user Metaphysician]]. || Frankly speaking, the style of this piece is influenced strongly by Metaphysician's other works. ||
|| [[[SCP-2430]]] || Despite the nickname of "Immortal Hitler Clone", it is not all of the above in how one would expect normally. || Why must it always be 'em Nazis? ||

Dr. Hu An is involved in amending documentation on the following SCP objects.

[[collapsible show="+ View List of Amended Documentation" hide="- Hide List of Amended Documentation"]]
||~ SCP No. ||~ Affiliated Personnel ||~ Pros ||~ Cons ||
|| [[[SCP-2144]]] || [[*user Schrodingers_Kitty]] || It's a literal Schrodinger's Cat and is an exercise in deconstructing a literalist take on the famous thought experiment and how a flawed idea survives in the "real" world. || There could be much more innovative ways in rendering Schrodinger's Cat as an SCP, which may make a literalist approach comparably underwhelming to what it could really do. ||

Dr. Hu An has contributed to the following collaborative projects regarding certain SCP objects. [[footnote]] Contributions may be expunged or deleted upon the wishes of the project head or staff members. [[/footnote]]

[[collapsible show="+ View List of Contributions" hide="- Hide List of Contributions"]]
||~ Document Name ||~ Project Head ||~ Reference File ||~ Pros ||~ Cons ||
|| [[[SCP-978 Extended Test Logs|SCP-978 Extended Test Log]]] || [[*user yellowdrakex]] || **Subject:** Dr. Hu An || It was something based on my own feelings towards Chinese New Year. Despite it being billed as a time where families get together, modern trends suggest otherwise. That said, the ideal remains as something some people desire in the hectic-ness of daily life. || I seriously don't want to include the bit about the //cheongsam// since it is technically Manchu in origin. But then again, it is actually worn by females during Chinese New Year so... yeah, the rest's history. || 
|| [[[SCP-2673 Containment Maintenance Log|SCP-2673 Containment Maintenance Log]]] || [[*user sirpudding]] || **Date:** 06/15/2015 || I've never written a pantoum before, and I was glad to have done it. This poetic form was fun to play around. The repeating verses act as a loop to SCP-2673, or at least that's the in-universe intent. || From an in-universe perspective, it is possible for 2673 to manipulate the loop and "skip ahead". ||
|| [[[SCP 2305 collab |SCP-2305-A Extended Documentation Log]]] || [[*user ObserverSeptember]] || **Item #:** SCP-139, **Item #:** SCP-2144 **Item #:** SCP-2516, **Item #:** SCP-2707 || All these are underrated SCPs which I feel that they should have a shoutout by someone in the wiki, beyond their SCP page.  || 2144 is blatant self-advertising. The foiled attempts can get over-the-top very easily. ||

The following fictional publications on //The Foundation// monthly newsletter are attributed to Jr. Researcher Hu Zhi.

[[collapsible show="+ View List of Published Fiction" hide="- Hide List of Published Fiction"]]
||~ Tale ||~ Pros ||~ Cons ||
|| [[[How 173 Got to Site-19]]] || It tackles 3 aspects: A lampshade to attempts of 173-orientated Tales a la [[[Revised Entry]]], an answer to why 173's description begins with "Moved to Site-19 1993", and the implications of a "true" Foundation operating on a multiversal scale that effectively reduces the value of entire realities into that of D-class personnel. || The narrative may come off as unevenly spread out, with the first tab having relatively more and roundabout content and the latter 2 have relatively less and brief content. ||
|| [[[Project Morpheus]]] || It develops on the "true" multiversal Foundation concept that I pioneered, and hints on the World Tree concept (which will be the postulate of my argument). In that sense, it is a good starting point. || Its attempted re-imagining of SCP-990 may come off as a poor explanation of it, and the Oneiroi Collective's portrayal //may// be one with flawed comprehension on my part. ||
|| [[[Database error?]]] || SCP-2140 may be short for a Thaumiel, but it can let loose a whole can of worms. This may well be the first of these worms. || This is admittedly open-ended, but to close it would be a travesty. ||

||~ Document Name ||~ Project Head ||~ Reference File ||~ Pros ||~ Cons ||
|| [[[SCPoems]]] || [[*user A Fat Ghost]] || **"2406"** || It is a shout-out to the CotBG vs Flesh sub-mythos, which is one of my favourites in this site. Also, I've noted that the article is not really updated with Series II/III stuff. || The haiku effectively spoils the entire sub-mythos. ||
|| [[[Visionsofabetterworld|Visions of a Better World]]] || [[*user TheDuckman]] || SCP-1915 ("As it turns out... nuclear wasteland"); SCP-2076 ("And Jr. Researcher Hu Zhi... unified around its Foundation") || You don't need monsters to destroy the world. Sometimes, the most dangerous monsters are ourselves. || Even if humanity as a whole is behind the Foundation, that matters little in the grand scheme of things. ||
|| [[[/askinate-herr-spankoflex|Ask Dr. Spanko]]] || [[*user Edrobot]] || **-Jr Researcher Hu Zhi** || Having learnt (or still learning) the eccentricities of language, Spanko's speech got me asking a sincere question regarding conlang. || I'm still not a fan of Spanko itself and how //certain// Keter SCPs react towards it. ||

Agent Hu Bao has recovered the following document from targeted Groups of Interest. 

[[collapsible show="+ View Confiscated Document" hide="- Hide Confiscated Document"]]
||~ GoI Document ||~ Group of Interest ||~ Pros ||~ Cons ||
|| [[[The Reassembled One]]] || Serpent's Hand || It began from a question "Why Cain has metal implants?", and was answered by transplanting it into the CotBG world and merging it with mythological anecdotes. || Unintentionally, it also has significant Christian influences on par with //The Chronicles of Narnia//. ||
