Since the accident of her brother Jr. Researcher Hu Zhi, Dr. Hu An refrains from speaking at all despite not being mute.

[[tab Jr. Researcher Hu Zhi]] 

**Name:** Jr. Researcher Hu Zhi

**Security Clearance Level:** 2 

**Position:** //The Foundation// Columnist

**Site of Operations:** Site-754 (Hong Kong SAR, China)

**Service Trancript:** The middle son of Dr. Hu Shi-ming, Jr. Researcher Hu Zhi joined his sister after graduating from [REDACTED]. However, during a containment breach by SCP-████, Jr. Rsr. Hu Zhi was crippled due to a stray bullet to his left leg. He was subsequently relieved of active duty and hospitalised in [REDACTED], given a prosthetic to assist him in walking about.

While hospitalised, Jr. Rsr. Hu Zhi pursued his hobby of writing and even submitted a few of his written works to //The Foundation// monthly newsletter. This attracted the attention of the Editor, who wished to have Jr. Rsr. Hu Zhi transferred and continued writing. Since then, Jr. Rsr. Hu Zhi assisted in journalism within the Foundation.

[[tab Agent Hu Bao]]

**Name:** Agent Hu Bao

**Security Clearance Level:** 4 

**Position:** MTF-B-1 ("Cauterisers") Operative 

**Site of Operations:** [REDACTED]

**Service Transcript:** The youngest son of Dr. Hu Shi-ming, he dropped out of university inexplicably and travelled the world at the age of 23. While he was in [REDACTED], Greece, he encountered several Foundation agents attempting to recover SCP-███ from the Church of the Broken God and Serpent's Hand. Initially believed to be an eyewitness, agents attempted to detain Hu Bao for amnestic treatment. Hu Bao was only apprehended after 32 hours of pursuit throughout the island of Crete. 

Interrogation reveals his ties to Dr. Hu Shi-ming, a Foundation researcher. Due to his "street smarts" (and maybe upon the recommendations of his father), he was assigned a place in Mobile Task Force Beta-1 ("Cauterisers"). In particular, Agent Hu Bao's is to focus on locating the "Wanderer's Library" where the Serpent's Hand is supposedly based at. 

Although he wishes not to talk about his family, it is known that Agent Hu Bao maintains a family photograph in his private locker. Due to his 2 elder siblings figuring his new phone numbers frequently, Agent Hu Bao changes his phone once every 2 weeks. Agent Hu Bao also wishes not to be employed to (Southeast and/or East) Asia, perhaps unwilling to return home.

[[tab Qualitative Analysis]]
Dr. Hu An has reviewed and offered advisory on the following SCP objects. 

||~ SCP No. ||~ Pros ||~ Cons ||
|| [[[SCP-2617]]] || It touches on a decent stretch of history, from the start of the Russian Empire to the USSR during WWII and how people of respective eras interact with said anomaly. || While it touches a lot on its use and the false Tsar, there is relatively little about the Grigori  – considering that the core idea is "General Winter". || 
|| [[[SCP-2955]]] || It explores the idea of the "lost city of gold" and turns it into a cat-and-mouse game for both the Foundation and the many explorers before them. || I will admit that the ending does not carry the "they are sapient and recognise the Foundation's good intents to make peace with these beings" as well as I intended. || 

Dr. Hu An is involved in amending documentation on the following SCP objects.

||~ SCP No. ||~ Affiliated Personnel ||~ Pros ||~ Cons ||
|| [[[SCP-2144]]] || [[*user Schrodingers_Kitty]] || It's a literal Schrodinger's Cat and is an exercise in deconstructing a literalist take on the famous thought experiment and how a flawed idea survives in the "real" world. || There could be many (potentially innovative) ways one goes about in rendering Schrodinger's Cat as an SCP, and a literalist approach may be among the most straightforward of them. || 

Dr. Hu An has contributed to the following collaborative projects regarding certain SCP objects. [[footnote]] Contributions may be expunged or deleted upon the wishes of the project head or staff members. [[/footnote]]

||~ Document Name ||~ Project Head ||~ Reference File ||~ Pros ||~ Cons ||
|| [[[SCP-978 Extended Test Logs|SCP-978 Extended Test Log]]] || [[*user yellowdrakex]] || **Subject:** Dr. Hu An || It was something based on my own feelings towards Chinese New Year. Despite it being billed as a time where families get together, modern trends suggest otherwise. That said, the ideal remains as something some people desire in the hectic-ness of daily life. || I seriously don't want to include the bit about the //cheongsam// since it is technically Manchu in origin. But then again, it is actually worn by females during Chinese New Year so... yeah, the rest's history. || 
|| [[[SCP-2673 Containment Maintenance Log|SCP-2673 Containment Maintenance Log]]] || [[*user sirpudding]] || **Date:** 06/15/2015 || I've never written a pantoum before, and I was glad to have done it. This poetic form was fun to play around. The repeating verses act as a loop to SCP-2673, or at least that's the in-universe intent. || From an in-universe perspective, it is possible for 2673 to manipulate the loop and "skip ahead". ||

The following fictional publications on //The Foundation// monthly newsletter are attributed to Jr. Researcher Hu Zhi.

||~ Tale ||~ Pros ||~ Cons ||~ Trivia ||
|||||||| **[DATA CLASSIFIED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE]** ||

Agent Hu Bao has recovered the following document from targeted Groups of Interest. 

||~ GoI Document ||~ Group of Interest ||~ Pros ||~ Cons ||
|| [[[The Reassembled One]]] || Serpent's Hand || It began from a question "Why Cain has metal implants?", and was answered by transplanting it into the CotBG world and merging it with mythological anecdotes. || Unintentionally, it also has significant Christian influences on par with //The Chronicles of Narnia//. ||
