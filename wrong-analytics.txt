[[tab Dr. Hu An]]

**Name:** Dr. Hu An

**Security Clearance Level:** 3 

**Position:** Containment Consultant

**Site of Operations:** Subject to changes; currently Site-742 (Sarawak, Malaysia)

**Service Transcript:** The eldest daughter of Dr. Hu Cuo, Dr. Hu An entered the Foundation upon completion of her studies in [REDACTED]. Since the accident of her brother Jr. Researcher Hu Zhi, Dr. Hu An refrains from speaking at all despite not being mute. Instead, she communicates via text messages, American sign language and even carries her handphone and a writing pad to convey ideas. When probed by superiors, she had written the following answer:

> The written word is the definite word.

Despite her silence, she is dedicated to her work. Instructions conveyed by Dr. Hu An are known to have heightened site safety and reduced containment breaches.

[[tab Jr. Researcher Hu Zhi]] 

**Name:** Jr. Researcher Hu Zhi

**Security Clearance Level:** 2 

**Position:** //The Foundation// Columnist

**Site of Operations:** Site-754 (Hong Kong SAR, China)

**Service Transcript:** The middle son of Dr. Hu Cuo, Jr. Researcher Hu Zhi joined his sister after graduating from [REDACTED]. However, during a containment breach by SCP-████, Jr. Rsr. Hu Zhi was crippled due to a stray bullet to his left leg. He was subsequently relieved of active duty and hospitalised in [REDACTED], given a prosthetic to assist him in walking about.

While hospitalised, Jr. Rsr. Hu Zhi pursued his hobby of writing and even submitted a few of his written works to //The Foundation// monthly newsletter. This attracted the attention of the Editor, who wished to have Jr. Rsr. Hu Zhi transferred and continued writing. Since then, Jr. Rsr. Hu Zhi assisted in journalism within the Foundation.

[[tab Agent Hu Bao]]

**Name:** Agent Hu Bao

**Security Clearance Level:** 4 

**Position:** MTF Delta-5 ("Front Runners") Operative 

**Site of Operations:** [REDACTED]

**Service Transcript:** The youngest son of Dr. Hu Cuo, he dropped out of university inexplicably and travelled the world at the age of 23. While he was in [REDACTED], Greece, he encountered several Foundation agents attempting to recover SCP-███ from the Church of the Broken God and Serpent's Hand. Initially believed to be an eyewitness, agents attempted to detain Hu Bao for amnestic treatment. Hu Bao was only apprehended after 32 hours of pursuit throughout the island of Crete. 

Interrogation reveals his ties to Dr. Hu Cuo, a Foundation researcher. Due to his "street smarts" (and maybe upon the recommendations of his father), he was assigned a place in Mobile Task Force Delta-5. In particular, Agent Hu Bao's is to focus on locating the "Wanderer's Library" where the Serpent's Hand is supposedly based at. 

Although he wishes not to talk about his family, it is known that Agent Hu Bao maintains a family photograph in his private locker. Due to his two elder siblings figuring his new phone numbers frequently, Agent Hu Bao tends to change his phone once every two weeks. Agent Hu Bao also wishes not to be deployed to (Southeast and/or East) Asia, perhaps unwilling to return home.

[[tab Qualitative Analysis]]
Dr. Hu An has reviewed and offered advisory on the following SCP objects. 

[[collapsible show="+ View List of Reviewed SCPs" hide="- Hide List of Reviewed SCPs"]]
||~ SCP No. ||~ Codename ||~ Commentary ||
|| [[[SCP-2617]]] || Winter Battalion Command || It touches on a decent stretch of history, from the start of the Russian Empire to the USSR during WWII and how people of respective eras interact with said anomaly. ||  
|| [[[SCP-2955]]] || Every Wandering Golden City of the Caesars || It explores the idea of the "lost city of gold" and turns it into a cat-and-mouse game for both the Foundation and the many explorers before them. || 
|| [[[SCP-2159]]] || Head-"Kanon" || It is a commentary of sorts: While we always consider headcanons of a franchise, these headcanons are but unified by that common point between all of them. Sometimes, even the creators of the franchise might take influence from the fanbase and incorporate into their end-product (ascended fanon). || 
|| [[[SCP-2698]]] || O Great One Communing Human via Computer || It started out as a fridge logic take on tentacle erotica, which evolved into a homage into Lovecraftian works and grew an absurdist tone. || 
|| [[[SCP-2312]]] || A Petty King || I am primarily proud of incorporating the aspect of security clearance to justify a short article from an in-universe perspective. ||
|| [[[SCP-2248]]] || Temple of Luna Primogenita || It incorporates trivial bits of history and myth, enough to get people to imagine the events of the past. || 
|| [[[SCP-2833]]] || Lineage of Vaski || My first attempt on Sarkicist SCPs, it leads itself to world-building of a setting paved by [[*user Metaphysician]]. || 
|| [[[SCP-2430]]] || Immortal Hitler Clone || Despite the nickname of "Immortal Hitler Clone", it is not all of the above in how one would expect normally. || 
|| [[[SCP-2511]]] || Kappa Population Distribution: More in Mongolia than anywhere else || While there is SCP-140, SCP-1237 or SCP-2140 that shift reality on a whim, we don't really see the results. This SCP here //may// or //may not// be the aftermath of this manner of anomalies. Either that or God is a bunch of novelists with weird sense of humour. || 
|| [[[SCP-2372]]] || Soulmates || In many cultures, they believe that the soul is not singular and has many sub-components. Even in your intimate moments, you are not alone and this article butts into the intimate moments of a person. || 
|| [[[SCP-2752]]] || Junk Male || This is my experimental attempt at weirdness-oriented SCPs. || 
|| [[[SCP-2457]]] || 母を見たい ("//haha o mitai//") || This brings out the investigative aspects of the Foundation's employees. ||
|| [[[SCP-2478]]] || Ordinary Japanese People || If one can become part of the in-group, does it matter if you become monstrous (literally and figuratively)? ||
|| [[[SCP-2953]]] || Polymorphism-Inducing Rocks || While anomalies can be used for political manipulation, why bother when there is good old-fashion military might? Also, there is more to [[[SCP-953]]] than the generic monster everyone made her to be. ||
|| [[[SCP-2748]]] || Driving Roadkill from Xiangxi || A prompt from reddit was the inspiration for this, and it became the vehicle for an idea I did not find time or means to get about. ||
|| [[[SCP-392]]] || A Plant Now Found in Site-103, and Formerly Found in the Households of Nobility || An expansion on Daevite culture, and how other cultures use this piece of decontextualised culture. || 
|| [[[SCP-2720]]] || Penguin Honeymoon Suite || A semi-homage to //Love Live Sunshine!//, something that I grew fond of. The other half is a brief consideration about Foundation fronts that would rather do their "fake" job for real. ||
|| [[[SCP-2781]]] || Bodhisattva of the High Seas || Between the previous duty of the Foundation and newfound duty of a bodhisattva, the Middle Way prevails. ||
|| [[[wrong-proposal|SCP-001 (Wrong Proposal)]]] || The Consensus || My magnum opus and entry for History Contest 2017. It is a summation of my headcanon and the things I like about the Foundation-verse manifested on the site for posterity. A.K.A. runner-up entry for the History Contest 2017. ||
|| [[[SCP-2596]]] || A Big Ship-load || I wanted to focus on the Horizon Initiative and explore a more subtle side to their not-really-elaborated anti-cult movements. ||
|| [[[SCP-3434]]] || ...And We'd Rather Remain in the Darkness || My entry for SCP-3000 Contest. While some get to live in the light, what happens in the darkness? ||

Dr. Hu An is involved in amending documentation on the following SCP objects.

[[collapsible show="+ View List of Amended Documentation" hide="- Hide List of Amended Documentation"]]
||~ SCP No. ||~ Affiliated Personnel ||~ Codename ||~ Commentary ||
|| [[[SCP-2144]]] || [[*user Schrodingers_Kitty]] || Misconception of a Brainchild || It's a literal Schrodinger's Cat and is an exercise in deconstructing a literalist take on the famous thought experiment and how a flawed idea survives in the "real" world. || 
|| [[[SCP-1186]]] || [[*user Bunton]] || Cochlear Cicadas || I looked at the original version, and thought to myself //Journey to the West// and Xuanzang (a.k.a. the Golden Cicada). And it gave me the direction to press for rewrite. || 
|| [[[SCP-2247]]] || [[*user TimmyTim ]] || "What did I go through to seek a new employer?" || When it comes to anomalous humans, the usual question is "How did they adapt from life as a normal human?" Now, what if it is reversed, that an object become human instead? ||

||~ Document Name ||~ Project Head ||~ Reference File ||~ Commentary ||
|| [[[SCP-978 Extended Test Logs]]] || [[*user agatharights]] || **Subject:** Dr. Hu An || It was something based on my own feelings towards Chinese New Year. Despite it being billed as a time where families get together, modern trends suggest otherwise. That said, the ideal remains as something some people desire in the hectic-ness of daily life. || 
|| [[[SCP-2673 Containment Maintenance Log]]] || [[*user sirpudding]] || **Date:** 06/15/2015 || I've never written a pantoum before, and I was glad to have done it. This poetic form was fun to play around. The repeating verses act as a loop to SCP-2673, or at least that's the in-universe intent. Also, from an in-universe perspective, it is possible for 2673 to manipulate the loop and "skip ahead". ||
|| [[[SCP 2305 collab|SCP-2305-A Extended Documentation Log]]] || [[*user ObserverSeptember]] || **Item #:** SCP-139, **Item #:** SCP-2144 **Item #:** SCP-2516, **Item #:** SCP-2707 || All these are underrated SCPs which I feel that they should have a shoutout by someone in the wiki, beyond their SCP page.  ||  
|| [[[SCP-1471-J Supplement Log]]] || [[*user Cyantreuse]] || **Recorded instance #358, documented 02.27.2016** || My first contribution to a -J article, this is a joke that preludes a change of mobile phone. ||

The following fictional publications on //The Foundation// monthly newsletter are attributed to Jr. Researcher Hu Zhi.

[[collapsible show="+ View List of Published Fiction" hide="- Hide List of Published Fiction"]]
||~ Tale ||~ Commentary ||
|| [[[How 173 Got to Site-19]]] || It tackles 3 aspects: A lampshade to attempts of 173-orientated Tales a la [[[Revised Entry]]], an answer to why 173's description begins with "Moved to Site-19 1993", and the implications of a "true" Foundation operating on a multiversal scale that effectively reduces the value of entire realities into that of D-class personnel. ||
|| [[[Project Morpheus]]] || It develops on the "true" multiversal Foundation concept that I pioneered, and hints on the World Tree concept (which will be the postulate of my argument). In that sense, it is a good starting point. || 
|| [[[Database error?]]] || SCP-2140 may be short for a Thaumiel, but it can let loose a whole can of worms. This may well be the first of these worms. || 
|| [[[Santa's New Home]]] || A strange interpretation of Santa in the SCP multiverse, mixed with a Christmas tale. || 
|| [[[SCP the Anime, part 4 (Gears/Iceberg, Clef/Kondraki, Rights/Light, Kain, monkey!Bright)]]] || It manages to be an outlet for me to throw down quite a number of my headcanon in writing, and allow me to do the anime-SCP Foundation crossover that I struggle to accomplish. Also, I get to smash the 4th wall. ||
|| [[[Indwelling of Bright]]] || The Doctors of the Church canon was among the first canons I read, and I am fascinated by the different takes on common Foundation tropes (e.g. the D-class). It is only an absolute shame for them to be left buried in the flood of new stuff. ||
|| [[[Etymology of die Glocke]]] || Modified from my entry for 2016 X-mas Art Exchange, I took MacLeod's character of Otto Weber and made him a character. He may have worked for the Nazis, but not all Nazis have to be painted with the same stroke. ||

||~ Document Name ||~ Project Head ||~ Reference File ||~ Commentary ||
|| [[[SCPoems]]] || [[*user A Fat Ghost]] || **"2406"** || It is a shout-out to the CotBG vs Flesh sub-mythos, which is one of my favourites in this site. Also, I've noted that the article is not really updated with Series II/III stuff. || 
|| [[[Visionsofabetterworld|Visions of a Better World]]] || [[*user TheDuckman]] || SCP-1915 ("As it turns out... nuclear wasteland"); SCP-2076 ("And Jr. Researcher Hu Zhi... unified around its Foundation") || You don't need monsters to destroy the world. Sometimes, the most dangerous monsters are ourselves. || 
|| [[[/askinate-herr-spankoflex|Ask Dr. Spanko]]] || [[*user Edrobot]] || **-Jr Researcher Hu Zhi** || Having learnt (or still learning) the eccentricities of language, Spanko's speech got me asking a sincere question regarding conlang. ||

Agent Hu Bao has recovered the following documents from targeted Groups of Interest. 

[[collapsible show="+ View Confiscated Document" hide="- Hide Confiscated Document"]]
||~ GoI Document ||~ Group of Interest ||~ Commentary ||
|| [[[The Reassembled One]]] || Serpent's Hand || It began from a question "Why Cain has metal implants?", and was answered by transplanting it into the CotBG world and merging it with mythological anecdotes. || 
|| [[[SPC-2615]]] || Shark Punching Center/The Centre || At any rate, I would say that I dare to make an "SPC goi-format" work out to the best of my ability and lends itself to world-building of the Centre's world. || 
|| [[[SC-95/347-00/723]]] || Chaos Insurgency || SCP-042 ended off at an awkward note, to me. And I felt there is much more to it than meets the eye. || 
|| [[[MEMORANDUM 321 REGARDING PROJECT 707]]] || Organisation for The Reclamation of Islamic Artefacts || While Eskobar's interpretation of ORIA gives off the vibe of progressiveness, it also seems very idealistic. Ergo, ORIA is a tough ship to manage. ||
