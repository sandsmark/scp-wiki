**Item #:** SCP-3307

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3307 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell, currently in Site-17. The containment chamber for SCP-3307 is modified to allow for transport and disposal of produced materials through a garbage chute installed on a wall. During testing, any windows present must be covered, or otherwise made unavailable for SCP-3307 to see through, in order to limit unintended production of materials. Food items produced by SCP-3307 outside of a testing environment are to be confiscated and destroyed immediately. 

**Description:** SCP-3307, formerly known as Agent J. ███████, is a human male roughly 32 years of age. SCP-3307 has no abnormal outward characteristics, and is physically healthy. However, when in the presence of any other human[[footnote]]This appears to be dependent on whether or not SCP-3307 can observe an individual. If unaware of an individual's presence, the process will not begin.[[/footnote]], SCP-3307 will begin to produce food or drink inside its body, which is expelled by vomiting or defecation. This food forms in the stomach via an unknown process, and travels up the esophagus, or down the intestines, depending on the type of material created. This process does not cause SCP-3307 any physical distress, as SCP-3307's internal organs appear to be able to expand to allow harmless transport of materials, but can cause significant psychological distress, as SCP-3307 experiences trouble breathing while expelling food through the mouth. Since recovery, SCP-3307 has not felt the need to eat, and has been unable to stomach any food it has been given. 

Food items produced by SCP-3307 are edible, and have roughly the same nutritional value as a normal food item would. SCP-3307 is able to produce virtually any food, or combination of foods; the type of food or drink created appears to depend on the individual SCP-3307 has been exposed to, and is almost always identified by the individual as a 'comfort food' or 'favorite food'. Solid food items are expelled through the mouth, or anus in some instances. Liquid food items are most often expelled in a manner similar to urination. These food items, due to their method of expulsion, are often visually unappealing, being smashed or coated with saliva or mucous. Due to the method by which food and drink items are produced, most individuals report feeling disgusted by the process, and will not willingly consume produced items. If exposed to multiple individuals at the same time, food production will begin in order of which individual was perceived first. The time it takes for the process to be complete varies based on the type of food or beverage produced, but averages around 2 minutes per item. 

SCP-3307 was recovered following a field mission on 11/23/██[[footnote]]This day was Thanksgiving day in America on that year.[[/footnote]] during which ██ members of MTF Theta-90 ("Angle Grinders") were exposed to a Class 2 spatial anomaly. Agent J. ███████ was, for approximately 30 minutes, missing in action, having reportedly lost contact with the rest of his team after being pulled into the spatial anomaly. Following this, Agent ███████ was ejected, unharmed, along with what appears to be a decorative plastic cornucopia, which has since been confiscated. After recovery of Agent ███████, and subsequent discovery of anomalous effects, Agent ███████ was designated SCP-3307, and contained. 

**Addendum 01:** Following a short episode of inactivity, SCP-3307 produced a pu-pu platter, in which each individual piece of meat possessed a letter, number, or symbol carved into its surface. After roughly two hours of production, SCP-3307 ceased activity, allowing researchers to collect the produced food, which contained letters and symbols from roughly 40 languages, numeric codes, and hieroglyphics[[footnote]]Some of which were unknown, or considered to be dead languages.[[/footnote]]. After comparing the compiled data, researchers believe the complete message to be 'IS THIS GIFT NOT TO YOUR LIKING[?]'. SCP-3307 claims to have no knowledge behind the meaning and/or sender(s) of this message, and is being monitored for any similar transmissions.
