**Item #:** SCP-4635

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4635 is to be contained in Locker-348 in Site-32. Access to Locker-348 and use of SCP-4635 for experimental purposes is only permitted to MTF Alpha-7 ('Literature Professors') operatives who have been administered with a Class-LE amnestic[[footnote]] Class of amnestic used to erase all knowledge of a particular language. [[/footnote]] or who do not possess any grasp of the English language.

Personnel exposed to SCP-4635 without the above prerequisites are to be administered Class-A and/or Class-LE amnestics and placed under observation for any manifestations of SCP-4635's effects.

**Description:** SCP-4635 is a VHS tape with the label 'Language Mastery, Tape 1: English' taped on one side. No manufacturer logo or name can be found on the tape. SCP-4635 can be played and rewound normally on any VHS tape players without any internal problems with the tape player.

SCP-4635's contents include a six minute, thirty-five second video hereby designated as SCP-4635-1. SCP-4635-1 resembles an instructional video on how to speak basic English (A comprehensive summary of SCP-4635-1's details are covered in Addendum 4635-2).

SCP-4635-1's anomalous effects will only manifest should an individual who has a grasp of the English language watch it, regardless of their mastery of the language. Should such an individual watch or listen to SCP-4635-1 for a duration of greater than one minute, they will experience a temporary paralytic shock and are subsequently incapacitated for a maximum duration of 24 hours.

Following the individual's recovery from their initial shock, they will begin to experience the following symptoms within three months:

* Difficulty in understanding words or sentences being spoken in English
* Difficulty in reading documents or messages written in English
* Difficulty in writing words or sentences in English
* Difficulty in speaking English words or sentences

After a duration of three months, the individual’s grasp of the English language will degenerate to a point where they will find themselves completely unable to understand or express their thoughts in English. All attempts to help these individuals re-learn English or to help them forget SCP-4635-1 using amnestics at that point of manifestation have been unsuccessful.

**Addendum 4635-1:** //Discovery//

SCP-4635 was discovered in the home of Mr. A██████ (PoI-4367) in Liverpool, England on September 25th, 19██. Following the recovery of SCP-4635, Mr. A███████ was interrogated by Foundation agents about SCP-4635.

Dr. Orwell,

It has come to our attention that you have been conducting an excessively large number of tests with SCP-4635 with D-Class personnel. In addition, several of your fellow researchers have claimed that you have not been recording these tests, putting forward the possibility that you are not observing the regulations of Foundation testing on D-Class personnel. Hence, the Ethics Committee would like to send an official warning to you.

Should this warning not be heeded, disciplinary action may follow. This may include banning you from testing for an extended period of time.

This warning also comes following several reports given by your fellow researchers regarding your irregular behaviour in recent weeks. If you are facing problems, psychological or otherwise, consult with your Site Psychological Team for the best solution that can help you.

- The Ethics Committee

> We must punish ourselves to rid ourselves of our sins.
> 
> Praise be to Asuzak.
