**Item #:** SCP-353

**Object Class:** Keter 

**Special Containment Procedures:** Standard biological hazard UN 2814 precautions are to be maintained at all times (Biohazard Threat Level 4). Full hazardous materials suits, gloves and oxygen supply will be required to examine subject. A disinfectant shower and decontamination spray is standard procedure before and after contact with SCP-353.  The whole unit is to be kept underground, at negative pressure, and hermetically sealed at all times to prevent accidental contamination to the outside area. In the case of containment breach, all affected personnel are to be placed in immediate Biohazard Level 4 Quarantine. Termination will be required in the possibility of an outbreak of one or more Class 9 infectious agents.

SCP-353 itself is to be kept docile through the use of euphoric drugs in its food and water supply. Clothing in the form of disposable surgical scrubs are to be provided as needed: should SCP-353 need to leave its containment facility for any reason, it is to be fitted with explosive collar, time release drug delivery device (for euphorics) and biohazard containment suit. Should SCP-353's suit breach containment, emergency sterilization procedures up to and including incineration of the affected area are to be carried out. 

Aside from its crutches (necessary for ambulation), and the temporary use of some minor items for entertainment SCP-353 is to be allowed no personal property at this time. Should SCP-353 attempt to escape, all illumination in the facility is to be changed to night-vision red: SCP-353 has undergone hypnotic aversion therapy to cause an immediate paralyzing terror reaction to red-tinted light. Personnel equipped with biohazard gear may then retrieve her at their leisure.

**Description:** SCP-353 appears to be a normal human female, nineteen years old, of average physical capacity and average intelligence. Subject previously had blonde hair, which it preferred to tint black, but has since undergone full-body electrolysis for sanitary purposes.

SCP-353 is immune to the harmful effects of all bacterial and viral infections. Subject has been observed siphoning infectious agents from the air, nurturing them within her body, and then redistributing them with devastating effect to pandemic severity while remaining immune to the symptoms herself. SCP-353’s mood directly effects the radius of infections recorded, with increased emotional states leading to massively increased potency.

As of the writing of this report, SCP-353's blood contains traces of over one thousand different infecious agents, including Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Ebola, Marburg, sixty-seven different strains of the common cold, Herpes Simplex A, E. Coli, Cholera, Bubonic Plague, and malaria. At least 30% of said infectious agents were previously unknown to the medical community, making SCP-353 an invaluable resource.

**Addendium 353-2** History
SCP-353 was originally encountered in [DATA EXPUNGED] South Africa, where she seemed to be deliberately seeking to pick up strains of the Ebola virus. Foundation Personnel pursued SCP-353 to Germany, where they determined that she had successfully contracted Marburg and redistributed said virus to [DATA EXPUNGED]. Subject was eventually subdued by physical means and taken into Foundation custody with minimal loss of life.

SCP-353 initially refused to comply with any SCP Foundation requests and testing, but was later convinced to do so in exchange for certain concessions. To date, her true identity is unknown, as she gave no name other than "Vector," and refused to answer any questions about her past. SCP-353 claimed to have traveled the western world seeking greater infections for her 'collection': when asked why, she could not give a satisfactory response aside from, "Because I can." SCP-353 did not claim to recall when her ability manifested, but had expressed she was not always capable of such a function.

Initial containment procedures allowed SCP-353 several luxury items, including hair dye (SCP-353 preferred to dye its hair black for aesthetic purposes), personal electronics (CD player, television, etc), and various other minor luxuries. However, SCP-353's demands soon became unreasonable, culminating in a request for sexual male companionship. Denial of said request resulted in threats of violent response. Foundation personnel responded by forcibly removing all prior luxury items from SCP-353's confinement. Subject attempted to infect several D-Class personnel with viral agents (specifically necrotizing fasciitis) in retaliation. Foundation personnel then responded by tranquilizing SCP-353 and remitting her to the Division of Training and Development for retraining.

SCP-353 then underwent extensive psycho-technical therapy, implanting an extreme aversion to red light as a preventive measure and heightening her obedience reflex. Therapy proved to be extremely successful, resulting in a 200% increase in subject's Compliance Index. Final examination was carried out by Drs. Kondraki and Clef on ██-██-████: subject was placed in the presence of [[[SCP-625]]] and ordered not to move. As subject remained still even after its left foot was traumatically amputated, the treatment was deemed a success.

SCP-353 is currently used as a biohazard hotlab for the containment and study of infectious agents. Personnel wishing to make use of SCP-353 may contact Dr. Dumont at extension X████.
