**Item #:** SCP-353

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-353's unit is sealed with standard biological hazard UN 2814 precautions. Full hazardous materials suits, gloves and oxygen supply will be required to examine subject. A shower and decontamination spray is standard procedure before and after contact with SCP-353. The whole unit is sealed airtight at all times to prevent accidental contamination to the outside area. Due to the nature of SCP-353's ability, the entire level is certified Biohazard threat level 4. Direct communication with SCP-353 is to be performed only by certified personnel with skills in diplomacy, psychology, hostage negotiation situations and an overall friendly demeanor. A knowledge of music and musicians is greatly desired in these personnel. Above all else SCP-353 is to be kept placid and generally positive in attitude at all times. 

**Description:** SCP-353 or 'Vector' as she is happily referred to, was picked up in a [DATA EXPUNGED] near Dresden, Germany. By all means she is a normal human female, nineteen years old, of moderate attractiveness with average physical strength and constitution. Vector is an intelligent girl, wears only black, dyes her hair so, and applies equally dark makeup. She is incredibly fond of music, and will be kept happy by supplying new music and other modern entertainments regularly. She is particularly fond of American movies and video games. 

Vector does not claim to recall when her ability manifested, but she assures personnel that she was not always capable of such malevolent function. 

Vector can, seemingly at will, siphon viral infections into the air around her. It appears she can pick up dormant strains from local areas, nurture the infection within her body, and then redistribute them with devastating effect to pandemic severity while remaining immune to the symptoms herself. Her mood directly effects the radius of infections recorded, with increased emotional states leading to massively increased infections. Originally encountered in [DATA EXPUNGED] South Africa, where she seemed to be deliberately seeking to pick up strains of the Ebola virus, she was pursued to Germany where she successfully contracted the Marburg viral strain, and began redistributing the virus at a pop music festival when personnel attempted to arrest her. Eventually subdued by physical means and brought to the facility. 

Vector claims to have traveled the western world seeking greater infections for her own morbid 'collection'. She claims to be able to distribute Bubonic Plague, Smallpox, Yellow Fever, and other mostly extinct infections. She is eager to expand her collection, for unknown means. 

Recently, Vector has begun to express a desire for male company. Personnel with appropriately aged male children willing to take part in an experiment should report to Dr. [DATA EXPUNGED] ASAP.

**Note:** //See what I mean, Kondraki? Put a highly dangerous SCP in the body of an attractive female, and the Foundation turns into a bunch of simpering morons.// Clef.

**Note:** //If she's that hard up for sex, send her one of the Class D's. I'm sure after a couple of rapists pass through her, she'll have second thoughts about the requests she makes.// Dr. Bright

**Note:** //The wanton disregard for human life, and her embrace of the 'Vector' persona through the nickname and active collection signal a possible malignant narcissist.  Requesting approval for a psychological examination, would be willing to do personally.  This girl has the potential to be quite dangerous to us if we don't handle her correctly.// Dr. Glass
