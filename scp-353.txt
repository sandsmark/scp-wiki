**Item #:** SCP-353

**Object Class:** Neutralized

**Special Containment Procedures:** 

SCP-353 is to be kept on euphorics in her food and water at all times to prevent her power from overdeveloping. In situations where it is necessary for her to have more developed power she is to be given a cocktail of anti-euphorics and stimulants.

SCP-353's unit is sealed with standard biological hazard UN 2814 precautions. Full hazardous materials suits, gloves and oxygen supply will be required to examine subject. A shower and decontamination spray is standard procedure before and after contact with SCP-353.  The whole unit is sealed airtight at all times to prevent accidental contamination to the outside area. Due to the nature of SCP-353's ability, the entire level is certified Biohazard threat level 4. 

The entire level is to be turned into an advanced biological research hotlab, of which SCP-353 is the center. Time in the hotlab is to be rented out to interested agencies. These persons must not learn of SCP-353 though they are to be allowed to take advantage of SCP-353’s abilities.

SCP-353 is to wear full biohazard garb at all times outside the hotlab. Within the hotlab subject is to wear green scrubs and green paper ‘shoes’. Should any hair be reported as growing on SCP-353 it’s location is to be reported for immediate electrolysis.

SCP-353 is always to remain in close proximity with a handler. All of her handlers are hand picked to be absolutely loyal to the Foundation, and to be either male and gay, or female and strait.

Direct communication with SCP-353 is to be performed only by her handlers. SCP-353 is to wear a biological containment outfit at all times when her abilities are not actively being used. SCP-353 has been trained to fear all other humans and the world outside the hotlab to prevent an escape/liberation attempt.

SCP-353 is to be kept docile, and helpful and to be punished when she fails to cooperate, as well as rewarded when she cooperates. Punishment and rewards are to be determined by her handlers who have no desire of sparing the rod or spoiling the child

Any food, drink, or objects leaving the hot lab are to undergo total sterilization procedures.

**Description:** 

SCP-353 appears to be a normal human female, nineteen years old, of average physical capacity and average intelligence. Subject entirely lacks bodyhair due to full body electraloysis. Subject also fears the world outside the hotlab and has been trained to refuse to leave without a handler by her side.

SCP-353 can, seemingly at will, siphon viral infections into the air around her. It appears she can pick up dormant strains from local areas, nurture the infection within her body, and then redistribute them with devastating effect to pandemic severity while remaining immune to the symptoms herself.

SCP-353’s mood directly effects the radius of infections recorded, with increased emotional states leading to massively increased infections. Subject is used to promote the growth of bacterial and viral strains and cultures within the hotlab on demand.

**Addendium 353-2** History
SCP-353 was originally encountered in [DATA EXPUNGED] South Africa, where she seemed to be deliberately seeking to pick up strains of the Ebola virus, she was pursued to Germany where she successfully contracted the Marburg viral strain, and began redistributing the virus at a pop music festival when personnel attempted to arrest her.

SCP-353 was picked up in a [DATA EXPUNGED] near Dresden, Germany. Subject was eventually subdued by physical means and brought to the facility.  Subject's intelligence had appeared to be above average, but has refused to complete any of the provided intelligence tests.  

Initially after containment Subject's pathology was uncertain.  Subject preferred to be referred to as 'Vector', and refused to divulge any other name.  SCP-353 prefered to wear black, dye her hair, and apply equally dark makeup. 

SCP-353 claimed to have traveled the western world seeking greater infections for her 'collection'. Subject claimed to be able to distribute Bubonic Plague, Smallpox, Yellow Fever, and other mostly extinct infections. 

She was eager to expand her collection, for unknown means. SCP-353 did not claim to recall when her ability manifested, but had expressed she was not always capable of such a function.

When SCP-353 requested sex her bad attitude finally became too much. A special torture and interrogation team was brought in to break SCP-353’s mind then retrain SCP-353 as a docile hot lab. Shock and disorientation were used, as well as drugs and amnesiactics. both classical conditioning and operant conditioning were used. 

**Addendum 353-3** Archived notes prior to procedure change
**Note:**//Recently, SCP-353 has begun to express a desire for male company. Personnel with appropriately aged male children willing to take part in an experiment should report to to me ASAP// Dr. [DATA EXPUNGED]

**Note:** //Denied. Denied. DENIED. Who's bright idea was this twisted "Bring your kid to work day" thing anyway?// -Dr. Kondraki

**Note:** //See what I mean, Kondraki? Put a highly dangerous SCP in the body of an attractive female, and the Foundation turns into a bunch of simpering morons.// Clef.

**Note:** //The wanton disregard for human life, and her embrace of the 'Vector' persona through the active use of her powers and attire signal a possible malignant narcissist.  Requesting approval for a psychological examination, and counseling or therapy if necessary.// Dr. Glass

**Note:** //Given that this girl is a walking time bomb of viruses, I recommend that we tranq her, strap her to a table, and give her a massive dose of a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribavirin ribavirin]/[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon interferon]/██████████ cocktail to flush her system.// Dr. ████████

**Note:** //Flush her system, HELL no! Did you know that this girl somehow has the original strain of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu 1918 Spanish Flu?] As well as a half-dozen strains of viruses we've never seen? The research possibilities alone. . .// Dr. ██████████

**Note:** //Limited research approved.// O5-██

**Note:** //Give the girl access to some pornography if her base needs are so unquenchable. She is refused contact again this quarterly review. I for one don't need my son being sucked off by a virulent little goth girl and coming home with Lassa.// Containment Officer Devereux.
