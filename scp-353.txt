**Item #:** SCP-353

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Standard biological hazard UN 2814 precautions are to be maintained at all times (Biohazard Threat Level 4). Full hazardous materials suits, gloves and oxygen supply will be required to examine subject. A disinfectant shower and decontamination spray is standard procedure before and after contact with SCP-353. The whole unit is to be kept underground, at negative pressure, and hermetically sealed at all times to prevent accidental contamination to the outside area. In the case of containment breach, all affected personnel are to be placed in immediate Biohazard Level 4 Quarantine. Termination will be required in the possibility of an outbreak of one or more Class 9 infectious agents.

Subject should be fed three times a day, as standard, and provided with the minimum required comfort items; a twin size bed, a pillow, and a blanket. Clothing in the form of disposable surgical scrubs are to be provided as needed, but requests for items should otherwise be denied. Should SCP-353 need to leave its containment facility for any reason, it is to be fitted with explosive collar, time release drug delivery device (for dosages of euphoric substances) and biohazard containment suit. Should SCP-353's suit breach containment, emergency sterilization procedures up to and including incineration of the affected area are to be carried out.

**Description:** SCP-353 appears to be a normal human female, nineteen years old, of average physical capacity and average intelligence. Subject is immune to the harmful effects of all bacterial and viral infections. Subject has been observed siphoning infectious agents from the air, nurturing them within her body, and then redistributing them with devastating effect to pandemic severity while remaining immune to the symptoms herself. SCP-353’s mood directly effects the radius of infections recorded, with increased emotional states leading to massively increased potency.

As of the writing of this report, SCP-353's blood contains traces of over one thousand different infecious agents, including Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Ebola, Marburg, sixty-seven different strains of the common cold, Herpes Simplex A, E. Coli, Cholera, Bubonic Plague, SARS, and malaria. At least 30% of said infectious agents were previously unknown to the medical community, making SCP-353 an invaluable resource.

**History:**
SCP-353 was originally encountered in [DATA EXPUNGED] South Africa, where she seemed to be deliberately seeking to pick up strains of the Ebola virus. Foundation Personnel pursued SCP-353 to Dresden, Germany, where they determined that she had successfully contracted Marburg and redistributed said virus to [DATA EXPUNGED]. Subject was eventually subdued by physical means and taken into Foundation custody with minimal loss of life.

To date, her true identity is unknown, as she gave no name other than "Vector," and refused to answer any questions about her past. SCP-353 claimed to have traveled the western world seeking greater infections for her 'collection': when asked why, she could not give a satisfactory response aside from, "Because I can." SCP-353 did not claim to recall when her ability manifested, but had expressed she was not always capable of such a function.


**Note:** //The embrace of this 'Vector' persona, the fixation on the color black for cosmetic purposes, and the wanton disregard for human life all signal towards malignant narcissism, and possible paranoid schizophrenia.  Requesting approval for psychological examination; counseling or therapy may be useful in reducing her difficult demeanor.// Dr. Glass

**Note:** //Given that this girl is a walking time bomb of viruses, I recommend that we tranq her, strap her to a table, and give her a massive dose of a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribavirin ribavirin]/[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon interferon]/██████████ cocktail to flush her system.// Dr. ████████

**Note:** //Flush her system? Hell no! Did you know that this girl somehow has the original strain of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu 1918 Spanish Flu?] As well as a half-dozen strains of viruses we've never seen? The research possibilities alone. . .// Dr. ██████████
