    **Item #**: SCP-308

    **Object Class:** Euclid
    
    **Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-308 is placed in a 20 by 20ft sterilized room and is to have 2 armed personnel outside entrance. Any personnel entering containment room are to be decontaminated and wearing sealed bio-hazard gear.  No organic material is to placed inside SCP-308 without proper authorization. A observation window is on the right side of the room and should be checked for cracks or breaches daily. After experiment #42-██, no personnel is to be placed inside SCP-308. SCP-308 should remain open unless being used.

 
    **Description:** SCP-308 is a large ornate sarcarphagus of Aztec origin. SCP-308 was found at location ███████ among similar sarcophagi, SCP-308 was the only one that was empty. SCP-308 is covered in hieroglyphs that have been found to be not to be of the Aztec language and are currently indecipherable. Any living organic material placed inside SCP-308 will be rendered paralyzed, once the coffin is sealed with the lid the organic material will rapidly decay until only bone remains. Bone appears to be unaffected by SCP-308. Likewise, if dead organic material is placed inside SCP-308 and sealed, it will become active again. It has been found that SCP-308 only affects human organs this way. A whole human body will NOT become active after placement inside SCP-308 (see experiments #47-██ through ████). If a human heart is placed within SCP-308 and sealed it will become active and begin to beat. 

    	Further studies of this phenomenon have found that a series of organs placed inside SCP-308 will begin to grow a network of veins and arteries connecting the series of organs. Oddly, it has been found that if two of the same organs are placed within SCP-308 they will also grow connections. During experiment #51██ (see below), a human brain was found to have above normal brain function and would have an IQ of roughly 184. A complete set of organs have been completed and resembles a typical human body minus skin, muscle and skeletal structure. The mass of organs has been designated SCP-382 and has been moved to a holding tank in order to sustain it's life for further testing.
   																					
**Document #342-3: Experiment #51██ Transcript:**
Dr.████████:"Okay, attaching the electrodes."
Assistant 1: "Hmm, this can't be right, check the connections Doctor."
Dr.████████: "Everything's fine here"
Assistant 1: " Well, these readings are off the charts. It's surpassing the limits of human ability."
Dr.████████:"Ah! The Administrator will be pleased with these results, █████ go get the results to networking."
Dr.████████:██████! Are you listening? Go now."
Assistant 2 was acting as if paralyzed and was unresponsive.
Assistant 2 began speaking unintelligibly and had to be escorted from the room. He became violent and had to be terminated. It can be assumed that the brain or SCP-308 had affected him in some way, further studies are required.
