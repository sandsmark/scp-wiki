**Item #**: SCP-308

**Object Class:** Safe
    
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-308 is stored in a sterilize containment room under armed guard all times. Any personnel entering the room must be decontaminated and fitted with Level A encapsulation suits, and remotely observed for the duration of their visit. No organic material is to be placed in SCP-308 without Level 2 authorization. SCP-308 will remain open unless being studied.

**Description:** SCP-308 is an ornate funerary casing of Aztec origin, dated ~500 years old with dimensions 1.8m x .9m x 1.2m. It was found at the ███████ archaeological excavation among similar (though mundane) artifacts in a temple complex. SCP-308 is covered in Nahuatl pictographs consistent with ceremonial practices of its time, though unusual in the care and expense devoted to it. Under normal conditions the artifact is inert, but it seems to exert an entrancing effect on injured organisms nearby. This effect was first observed when Dr. ██████ injured his leg while excavating the artifact, [DATA EXPUNGED]

Regardless of the condition of an organism prior to entering the coffin (with one exception, see below), the creature will exhibit certain traits upon leaving it. Superficially the subject remains unchanged, including injuries or conditions sustained prior to exposure. Despite the nature and seriousness of any such trauma, however, the subject appears alive and responsive to the extent its injuries allow. For example, a subject exposed to a fatal dose of cyanide (in excess of 100x fatal dosage) conversed normally, respired, and displayed vital signs such as heartbeat and brain activity. The subject also displayed classical signs of acute poisoning such as shortness of breath, drowsiness, headache, and cyanotic skin, but did not succumb even after a period of many days. Another subject was pierced in several major arteries and exsanguinated, then exposed to SCP-308. Further examination revealed a heartbeat but no discernible blood pressure, and the subject was conversant though conscious of great pain in the injured areas. (For further experimental logs see 308-a, attached)

Subjects in this altered state will neither succumb to any injury, no matter how severe, nor heal any wound, no matter how minor. In addition they display a dependence on the artifact similar to addiction, insisting on regular exposure and becoming erratic and violent when this is withheld. Subjects suffering from advanced trauma experience pain normally, and as a result their psychological state deteriorates rapidly. Progressing conditions such as cancer and infectious diseases continue to advance in subjects exposed to SCP-308, though instead of dying they simply suffer from ever escalating symptoms. Additionally, parts of a whole organism can be animated through this means, provided the area used contains a heart (see below; for more information, consult 308-a). 

The only exception to the 

Living organic material placed inside SCP-308 is paralyzed, once the coffin is sealed with the lid the matter will rapidly decay until only bone, or other endurable substance, remains. The living tissue inside bones will be dissolved, but the actual bone is unaffected by SCP-308. Likewise, if dead organic material is placed inside SCP-308 and sealed, it will become active again. It has been found that SCP-308 only affects human organs and connective tissue this way. A deceased human body sealed in SCP-308 will have its organs and various blood vessels/arteries restored, while the skin and muscle tissue remains decayed (see experiments #47-██ through ████). For example, if a human heart is placed within SCP-308 and sealed it will become reactivated and begin to beat.

Further studies of this phenomenon have found that a series of organs placed inside SCP-308 will begin to grow a network of veins and arteries connecting them all. Oddly, it has been found that if two of the same organs are placed within SCP-308 they will also grow connections. During experiment #51██ (see below), a human brain was found to have above normal brain function and would have an IQ of roughly 256. A complete set of organs have been completed and resembles a typical human body minus skin, muscle and skeletal structure. Further study is required; SCP-308 could have useful purposes in reanimating dead personnel if scientific study shows that eventually the makeshift body will gain sentience and could be used by the Foundation. It is currently unknown what SCP-308 will do to a human who has one or more organs that are non-functioning, but it can be presumed it would make them recover while decaying the human itself.
   																					
**Document #342-3: Experiment #51██ Transcript:**
> Dr. ████████: Okay, attaching the electrodes.
> Assistant 1: Hmm, this can't be right, check the connections, Doctor.
> Dr. ████████: Everything's fine here.
> Assistant 1: Well, these readings are off the charts. It's surpassing the limits of human ability.
> Dr. ████████: Ah! The Administrator will be pleased with these results. █████, go get the results to storage.
> Dr. ████████: ██████! Are you listening? Go now.
> (Assistant 2 was acting as if paralyzed and was unresponsive.)
> (Assistant 2 began speaking unintelligibly and had to be escorted from the room. He became violent and had to be terminated. It can be assumed that the brain or SCP-308 had affected him in some way. Further studies are required.)

**Addendum 342-c:** Use of SCP-308 to pacify organic humanoid-sized SCPs has been suggested and is awaiting formal discussion.
