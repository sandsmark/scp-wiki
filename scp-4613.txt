**Item #:** SCP-4613

**Special Containment Procedures:** MTF Omega-17 ("Tears in Rain") are to use social media scraping software to determine the locations of SCP-4613 outbreaks. Any social media posts involved in an SCP-4613 event are to be archived and removed immediately. 

Once an SCP-4613 event is detected, cellphone and internet service to the area is to be suspended. After approximately 4 hours, this suspension may be lifted at the discretion of the SCP-4613 project head. 

The SCP-4613 project head must approve the entry of any individuals attempting to enter a location undergoing a SCP-4613 event. Under no circumstances are Foundation personnel allowed to directly interact with any SCP-4613 sufferers.

**Update**: Tests involving SCP-4613 are to be suspended under all circumstances pending an update to these containment procedures [[footnote]]See Incident 4613-65 for more information.[[/footnote]]. 

**Description:** SCP-4613 is a shared delusion predicated on the belief that Edward James Olmos[[footnote]]An actor and director.[[/footnote]](hereafter referred to as SCP-4613-1) will imminently arrive at the location occupied by the sufferer. SCP-4613 sufferers are capable of sharing this delusion among others at the same location through the usage of the phrase "Edward James Olmos is on his way". 

SCP-4613 lasts for approximately 3 hours, after which the originator of the delusion will convince other affected individuals that the event was a hoax. Secondary sufferers will, if separated from the originator of the effect, lose memory of SCP-4613 after the event ends.

SCP-4613 events generally originate from an individual that fulfills certain criteria. This includes knowledge of SCP-4613-1's name (plus familiarity with at least one work SCP-4613-1 directed or appeared in) and the ability to communicate vocally.

The SCP-4613 originator will often attempt to inform others of works featuring SCP-4613-1. The vast majority of secondary sufferers will become excited at the prospect of meeting SCP-4613-1, even if they previously knew little or nothing about SCP-4613-1. This will not preclude an individual leaving SCP-4613 affected locations, however.

SCP-4613's self-resolving nature makes it difficult to determine how long SCP-4613 has existed. SCP-4613 was first detected by automated social media scraping software utilized in other projects. Social media posts promoting SCP-4613 can attract others to the event, and will persist after the event concludes.

> On April 13th 2019, an SCP-4613 event occurred at a Denny's restaurant in Clifton Heights, PA. The event was determined to be anomalous despite the fact that SCP-4613-1 was making an appearance nearby. Foundation personnel prevented access to the affected location. 
> 
> The 4613 project head approved a previously planned test during this 4613 event. The test involved Foundation personnel persuading SCP-4613-1 to visit the location suffering from SCP-4613. This attempt was successful, and a Foundation driver began to transport SCP-4613-1 to the 4613 event.
> 
> Once SCP-4613-1 was within 11 kilometers of the event, SCP-4613 sufferers behaved in a manner inconsistent with previous incidents. The following log is compiled from video surveillance throughout the location (no audio was available).
> 
> **Incident 4613-65 Event Log:**
> 
> **13:59:** SCP-4613-1 is 11 kilometers from the SCP-4613 sufferers. The affected individuals (14 people between the ages of 17 and 64) begin to seek out and collect any paper that is available. Individuals stop performing any tasks they were previously performing. Work in the kitchen stops and diners no longer eat. 
> 
> **14:03:** SCP-4613-1 is 4 kilometers from the SCP-4613 sufferers. Affected individuals have begun to craft origami cranes with the available paper. None of the individuals present had a history of or training in the creation of such works. The SCP-4613 sufferers hold the cranes and do not move.
> 
> **14:10:** SCP-4613-1 arrives at the SCP-4613 affected location. He is allowed entry by Foundation personnel. All 14 SCP-4613 sufferers look directly at SCP-4613-1, place the cranes on the nearest available surface and then experience a sudden and violent cranial inversion. All individuals immediately expire.
> 
> **14:11:** SCP-4613-1 shakes his head, speaks for approximately 2 seconds, and leaves.
> 
> Following this incident Foundation personnel transported SCP-4613-1 away from the location. Continued surveillance of SCP-4613-1 has shown no further discussion of the event with any individuals.

> We are still attempting to understand this anomaly, and the containment procedures should be updated soon to reflect new knowledge gained during the test. It should be noted that lip reading experts have determined that SCP-4613-1's statement at the end of the test was "That wasn't funny the first time."
