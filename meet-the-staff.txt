title:Meet The Staff
[[div class="content-panel standalone series" style="background-color: #ffffeb;"]]

++ Senior Staff and You

These are the people who are assigned responsibilities on the site. It's their job to help keep the site running as smoothly and as well as possible. Most of them are veterans, with experience built up from the time spent here. Here's a small dossier to help show who the senior staff are. **If you have an issue for staff to address, please refer to the [[[Contact Staff]]] page.**

**Note:** You are expected to know who staff are when you encounter them "in the wild", because you have to know when to listen to them. You don't have to memorize or even thoroughly read these bios. But you do have to know which people are staff.

PS: Yes, these are tongue-in-cheek, but they're still true, so don't be surprised. We warned you.

++ Administrators

**[[[decibelle|Decibelles]]]:** Decibelle is Ex-Team Captain for Community Outreach, Rewrite, Ambassador and Mom (although she is not a mom herself). Rumor has it she makes sick beats, but current sightings of said sick beats are as of yet unconfirmed. She is most likely to be on IRC, but not too talkative. She also can't shut up about anime or weed (or unfortunately, when high, both). She also would like everyone to read the [http://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/ Wanderer's Library] and participate there, because why not? Have a nice day!

**[[[dr-django-bridge-personnel-file |Dexanote]]]:** Canadian Pokemon Master. Good at brainstorming and expanding on ideas, not so great when it comes to rewrites and refining failed drafts. Excellent at grammar and phrasing. Possibly part hobbit. Has not, in fact, caught them all.

**[[[dr-manns-personnel-file |Dr. Mann]]]:** A pretty cool guy, and a great writer. He's got a very impressive creative mind, [[[One Bad Mother| though sometimes it's used for evil.]]] Good choice for asking military-related questions. Also runs the [http://wanderers-library.wikidot.com Wanderers Library].

**[[[quikngruvn-personnel-file |Quikngruvn]]]:** Not that quick and rarely ever groovin', he's a cynical but generally easy-going old fart (born during Nixon's second term). By and large out of the critique business, but willing (and sometimes able) to answer specific questions in chat. Holds a degree in chemistry, is a --sysadmin-- developer by trade, and is a fan of trivia. Has an affinity for sarcasm and puns. Occasionally goes by Teratophobia in chat[[footnote]]Or, when feeling particularly edgy, [[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_grand_stellated_120-cell|GreatGrandStellated120Cell]]].[[/footnote]].

**[[[dr-rogets-file|Roget]]]:** The lil' Stalin himself. Very active, and willing to help people out, if you send him a PM. Tries to answer every wikidot PM sent to him... eventually. Administrates the [http://scp-foundation-origins.wikidot.com/ Foundation Origins] SCP role-playing game, and moderates the [http://wanderers-library.wikidot.com Wanderer's Library]. He's also written the [http://www.scp-wiki.net/history-of-the-universe-hub History Of The SCP Foundation] essay series, so he's the best person to ask questions about site history.

**[[[silberescher-personnel-file | Silberescher]]]:** Alias Silber. Pretty much everything he says is tongue-in-cheek or sarcastic. Remember that, and you'll get along with him well. Gives solid advice, and is an exceptional writer, even if he doesn't think he is (just read his writing). Also, kind of into comics and CCGs. Ask him about his SCP Magic Expansion.

**[[[doctor-s-s-personnel-file| SoullessSingularity]]]:** Quirky and bizarre --sometimes-- pretty much all the time, but mostly harmless. Soulless has an intense passion for horror, strong prose, and compelling fiction- and will be happy to help any drafts out in becoming these things! He'll gladly listen to just about anyone's concerns and can be waved down on the chat or in Private Message. Go ahead and ask him what 'lmapo' means.

**[[[the-deadly-moose-personnel-file |TheDeadlyMoose]]]:** Kind of sassy, but has a good eye for what works. Said to be a good editor. Has a tendency to leave lots of criticism. Likes talking about anthropology, psychology (ish), gender, and sexuality. Token admin of non-binary-gender (usually 'they'/'zie' pronouns). Admin at the [http://wanderers-library.wikidot.com Wanderers Library]. Current [[[Chat Guide|chat owner of #site19]]] and help chat ([http://05command.wikidot.com/chat #site17]). Will answer almost any question you care to ask.

**[[[dr-bright-s-personnel-file |TheDuckman]]]:** A.K.A. Bright. A self described "crotchety old man", so beware. He's blunt and crude, but always working for the best. Has been reliably active longer than any other present administrator. He is not now, nor has he ever been in recent memory, a monkey. 

**[[[researcher-zyn-s-personnel-file |Zyn]]]:** Psychology and social behavior major (formerly biology), [http://www.scp-wiki.net/into-that-good-night poetry enthusiast], part-time violin tutor, and butterfly caretaker (generally of //Nymphalis antiopa//, in the spring), Zyn is readily available for answering of questions in the IRC (send her a private message, or try #thecritters) and through wikidot PM. She can help if you want your articles to evoke non-scary emotions. Favors "Marp" as an onomatopoeia. Is kaiju butterfly ninja master on the weekends.

++ Moderators

**[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/dr-arvind-desais-personnel-file |A Random Day]]]:** SCP Wiki in the streets, IRC chat in the sheets. Promoted to staff because people were too lazy to explain why he shouldn't be. Inordinately proud of editing the SCP Site News. Resident expert on clinical tone - he even wrote [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/clinical-tone-declassified |the guide on it]]].

**[[[accelerando-personnel-file|Accelerando]]]:** Resident tagger of articles and music --aficionado-- dilettante. His attention span keeps him away from chat, and usually drops in once every 3 months before zipping back into the void. Highly willing to discuss and brainstorm article ideas (or albums) through PMs.

**[[user Blaroth]]:** AKA Roth. Probably not a cat. Runs the [http://scp-wiki-official.tumblr.com/ official tumblr] and a bunch of other things for Internet Outreach. Does way too much and is way too helpful.

**[[user ChaoSera]]:** Also answers to Chao, Sera and "that nerd in the corner". Can answer most Computer Science and Robotics related questions, happy to give critique on all kinds of drafts. Usually available in IRC and via PM. Has been made mod but nobody really knows why. Foul play is strongly suspected.

**[[[dr-magnus-personnel-file | DrMagnus]]]:** Most easily available via Wiki PM.  Current captain of the technical team, and Black Lion of the tech team voltron.  Teaches Historical Fencing, has three black belts, odd obsession with fountain pens + paper, and is in to tea.  Has been around the site //forever// and probably remembers whoever you're talking about.  Don't hesitate to reach out if there's a tech issue.

**[[[researcher-conwell-s-personnel-file|Jacob Conwell]]]:** After being hand crafted in Portland, Oregon, Conwell came to the wiki to write about robots, lasers, and people who make robots both with and without lasers. He’s usually in the chat, and is happy to look at drafts of all kinds. He’s better used for developing ideas than for fixing grammar, because words are hard.

**[[[leveritas-personnel-file|Leveritas]]]:** If Leveritas isn't in the [http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/c-50864/help:drafts-and-critiques drafts and critiques forum], call somebody. Currently the moderator pruning the [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/experiment-log-914 |experiment log for SCP-914]]]. Especially enjoys drafts with a strong sub-narrative. He's also fluent in Dutch, if you need that for some reason.

**[[[workers-of-the-world-unite |LilyFlower]]]:** Comrade Lily is now a Mod! She's happy to help with whatever you need as long as you //source your goddamn images//. Literally always on IRC, or send her a Wikidot PM. Always up to chat if you want, too! Just don't mention Thatcher.

**[[user ProcyonLotor]]:** is the only raccoon currently on staff, and thus the coolest one by default. He can appear grumpy at times, but in reality he's just a fan of whining and hyperbole. One of the chief licensing dorks, and always happy to answer questions about Creative Commons.

**[[[randomini|Randomini]]]:** will shout at you for not doing enough conceptual development, or help fix your CSS or JS shenanigans. Recommends the Characters Killed Per Paragraph (CK/P) as a metric for high-quality writing.

**[[[Dr. Adileh Khayyam's Personnel File|Taffeta]]]:** Taffeta is hungry for responsibility, horny for teamwork, ready to bust a nut up in this wiki. Skills include an 8-foot vertical leap. Young, dumb, and full of... [[[criticism-policy|you know. ;)]]] ##green|OH SHIT, THIS HAS OTHER COLOURS.## Thanks for your time. I love you.

**[[[tuomey-author-page|Tuomey]]]:** Juggles responsibilities, balls, and clubs - sometimes all at the same time. Celtic takeover now in progress. Frequently found lurking in IRC.

**[[[vincent-redgrave-s-author-page |Vincent_Redgrave]]]:** Vince is a graphic designer/marketing analyst in training and a fountain of nerd culture and useless general trivia. He's also an SCP wiki hype-man who helps run the [https://www.facebook.com/scpfoundation Official SCP Foundation Facebook Page] and wants you to go 'like' it this instant. Contact him if you need help with a story, with editing an image, or want to learn who 'Booster Gold' is or why Helvetica is literally the worst font.

**[[[wrongjohnsilver-s-author-page|WrongJohnSilver]]]:** WrongJohnSilver is known for his penchant for cufflinks and tie clips, providing patient, high-level draft critique, and the ability to be unfazed by any topic. He's the sort of person who can go from vacationing in a German spa town, to dodging the city watch and a zombie invasion on the streets of Prague within the week. Ask him about his extensive wine collection, or if you would like to rewrite an article.

++ Operational Staff

**[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/absentmindednihilist-s-personnel-file|AbsentmindedNihilist]]]:** AKA Niles. Neuroscience geek, aspiring screenwriter, empress of the bookworms. Active in chat and on site. Will happily critique the heck out of your grammar or your concept and is always delighted to receive PMs asking for advice. Recurring themes in her work include reimagining of mythology, evocative imagery, and gay dogs. May or may not be 5 corgis in a trenchcoat. Bork. 

**[[[pastry-based-aquatic-life-form-p13f15h |ChrisAKAPiefish]]]:** ChrisAKAPiefish is possibly a pastry, possibly a fish, possibly both. He runs the [https://www.facebook.com/scpfoundation Official SCP Foundation Facebook Page] and also draws possibly the worst Microsoft Paint drawings of SCP's the world has ever seen. He's a Support Analyst mostly working with SQL, he's an avid gamer and can usually be found lurking in [http://www.scp-wiki.net/chat-guide IRC].

**[[user Dankaar]]:** Another staffer who is mostly under the radar, the rarely spotted dankaar is Good With Critique.

**[[[Dr Bleeps Author Page| DrBleep]]]:** Most easily reached via IRC, or PM. Is a career Microbiologist, working towards graduate school, knowledgeable in most topics involving bacteria and viruses. Avid gamer, part of the Wikiwalk team. Staff member in other communities not involved with SCP. Sometimes on a full moon when they aren't running mad science, they are available to give critt.

**[[[fantem-s-poi-file |Fantem]]]:** Regularly found answering weird questions on the official tumblr, Fantem is a known bun and is to be apprehended on sight.

**[[[fieldstone-ao-file|fieldstone]]]:** Gives mostly solid advice in forum crit and posts randomly in other places. Also works on site news. Will almost always respond to PMs... eventually. --Sometimes-- disappears suddenly from IRC for spouse/parent duty. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_behavior_support Mental health professional.] Cares a lot about making sure people feel welcome here, and about this whole thing in general.

**[[[jr-psych-chibis-personnel-file|ghostchibi]]]:** Also goes by Blake or Maxson on IRC, because why not be as confusing as godly possible. Answers asks on the serious official SCP tumblr blog, kicks down the door to #site19 to come scream about stuff, and loves Fallout so much, so so much, listen it's a GOOD SERIES you guys I'm TELLING YOU IT'S

**[[user Joreth]]:** People think Joreth is a wolf - but he's actually a dog wearing a wolf hat. Believed to be made staff in a failed attempt to curb shitposting. Does Internet Outreach because no one wants him on the site.

**[[[personnel-file-lyusternik-lazar|Lazar]]]:** Draft critter. Idea critter. Possibly swamp critter. Can be found frequenting IRC and forums. Keeps a watchful eye on draft and idea forums to poach unsuspecting posts.

**[[user Mistbourne]]:** "The Man with the Red Pen", his grammarian tendencies tend to result in much nitpicking of the use of the English language.  Enjoys thunderstorms, mowing his lawn and gently correcting poor critique.


**[http://www.scp-wiki.net/modern-erasmus-author-page Modern_Erasmus]:** Erasmus tends to write about either deep historical mysteries or low quality puns. The Black Moon Howls with laughter at his dad jokes. Whether you need Crit, crosslinks, or rewrites, Erasmus is your guy. 

**[[user MrAnakinSpecter]]:** Master of ghosts and terrible jokes. Might one day finally one-up Tuomey, but it is unlikely.

**[[[wrong-analytics|MrWrong]]]:** Apparently the only staff member from Asia (specifically, Singapore) and alleged Japanophile (who //really// should try to venture out of articles based on Japanese cultural anecdotes). While he has written many articles, the ratings are admittedly not spectacular (SunnyClockwork attributes that to a lack of "plugging", so here's another avenue). Will be willing to look through drafts if asked to. Prefers to engage the site via a laptop. 

**[http://www.scp-wiki.net/sly161-s-author-page Sly161]:** Sly is a forum critter, they help run one of the Tumblr blogs, a fan of horror, and is an up and coming forensic investigator. You can come to them if you need crit on a draft. You can find them in 17 or #thecritters, and they will always try to answer Wikidot PMs.

**[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/dr-solo-s-personnel-file Dr Solo]:** Solo's usually around in 19, 17, or any of the hundred million unofficial side chats to lend a hand with crit and tell you that evolution doesn't work the way you think it does. You may know him as the author of such hits such as "the mayo one", "the potato one", and "the skeleton one".

**[[user subtletea]]:** The fastest pun in the west even though they live in the Northeast, would love to hear about your pets. Majors in wildlife biology. Is a bit of a homebody, and does not in fact have a wild life, unless you count seal rescue and horseshoe crab tagging. Also is the only staff with literally nothing posted on the main site. Come find them running the SCP dA or on the IRC chat! 

**[[[scp-tretter-j|tretter]]]:** tretter exists. You're most likely to see him on the draft forums or sharing his knowledge on the SCP Foundation and the lore of the universe that he's accrued from his unreasonable amount of time spent on the site. He's best contacted through wikidot PM, or you can find him in #thecritters. Also goes by trots when he's on his laptop. 

**[[[wogglebug-author-page|Wogglebug]]]:** Wogglebug is some guys who woggles, and definitely not a robot of some description. A fan of oldish books and coolish names, he's very much interested in both your article and you as a person. Tends to hang around Site19, and is (almost) always available for help with drafts on tales and SCPs. Rather great at editing.

**[[[the-file-of-an-acid-junkie-college-flunky-dirty-puppy-daddy |Zachary Maxwell]]]** is Acid Junkie College Flunky Dirty Puppy Daddy Bastard who will check your draft, fix your grammar, and link to useful stuff, when he's not selling lavender and wildflowers on Brighton beach.
