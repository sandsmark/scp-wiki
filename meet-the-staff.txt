title:Meet The Staff
[[div class="content-panel standalone series" style="background-color: #ffffeb;"]]

++ Senior Staff and You

These are the people who are assigned responsibilities on the site. It's their job to help keep the site running as smoothly and as well as possible. Most of them are veterans, with experience built up from the time spent here. Here's a small dossier to help show who the senior staff are. **If you have an issue for staff to address, please refer to the [[[Contact Staff]]] page.**

**Note:** You are expected to know who staff are when you encounter them "in the wild", because you have to know when to listen to them. You don't have to memorize or even thoroughly read these bios. But you do have to know which people are staff.

PS: Yes, these are tongue-in-cheek, but they're still true, so don't be surprised. We warned you.

++ Administrators

**[[[dr-django-bridge-personnel-file |Dexanote]]]:** Canadian Pokemon Master. Good at brainstorming and expanding on ideas, not so great when it comes to rewrites and refining failed drafts. Excellent at grammar and phrasing. Possibly part hobbit. Has not, in fact, caught them all.

**[[[dr-manns-personnel-file |Dr. Mann]]]:** A pretty cool guy, and a great writer. He's got a very impressive creative mind, [[[One Bad Mother| though sometimes it's used for evil.]]] Good choice for asking military-related questions. Also runs the [http://wanderers-library.wikidot.com Wanderers Library].

**[[[quikngruvn-personnel-file |Quikngruvn]]]:** Not that quick and rarely ever groovin', he's a cynical but generally easy-going old fart (born in the 70s). By and large out of the critique business, but willing (and sometimes able) to answer specific questions in chat. Holds a degree in chemistry, is a developer by trade, and is a fan of trivia. Has an affinity for sarcasm and puns. Occasionally goes by Teratophobia in chat[[footnote]]Or, when feeling particularly edgy, [[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_grand_stellated_120-cell|GreatGrandStellated120Cell]]].[[/footnote]].

**[[[dr-rogets-file|Roget]]]:** The lil' Stalin himself. Very active, and willing to help people out, if you send him a PM. Tries to answer every wikidot PM sent to him... eventually. Wrote the [http://www.scp-wiki.net/history-of-the-universe-hub History Of The SCP Foundation] essay series, so he's the best person to ask questions about site history.

**[[[silberescher-personnel-file | Silberescher]]]:** Alias Silber. Pretty much everything he says is tongue-in-cheek or sarcastic. Remember that, and you'll get along with him well. Gives solid advice, and is an exceptional writer, even if he doesn't think he is (just read his writing). Also, kind of into comics and CCGs. Ask him about his SCP Magic Expansion.

**[[[doctor-s-s-personnel-file| SoullessSingularity]]]:** Quirky and bizarre --sometimes-- pretty much all the time, but mostly harmless. Soulless has an intense passion for horror, strong prose, and compelling fiction- and will be happy to help any drafts out in becoming these things! He'll gladly listen to just about anyone's concerns and can be waved down on the chat or in Private Message. Go ahead and ask him what 'lmapo' means.

**[[[the-deadly-moose-personnel-file |TheDeadlyMoose]]]:** Kind of sassy, but has a good eye for what works. A good editor. Has a tendency to leave lots of criticism when de-lurked. Likes anthropology, psychology, gender, and sexuality. Non-binary-gender (usually 'they' or 'zie/zir' pronouns). Admin at the [http://wanderers-library.wikidot.com Wanderers Library]. Current [[[Chat Guide|chat owner of #site19]]] (now a ceremonial position!) and help chat ([http://05command.wikidot.com/chat #site17]). Permanently on Reserve.

**[[[dr-bright-s-personnel-file |TheDuckman]]]:** A.K.A. Bright. A self described "crotchety old man", so beware. He's blunt and crude, but always working for the best. Has been reliably active longer than any other present administrator. He is not now, nor has he ever been in recent memory, a monkey. 

**[[[researcher-zyn-s-personnel-file |Zyn]]]:** Psychology and social behavior major (formerly biology), [http://www.scp-wiki.net/into-that-good-night poetry enthusiast], part-time violin tutor, and butterfly caretaker (generally of //Nymphalis antiopa//, in the spring), Zyn is readily available for answering of questions in the IRC (send her a private message, or try #thecritters) and through wikidot PM. She can help if you want your articles to evoke non-scary emotions. Favors "Marp" as an onomatopoeia. Is kaiju butterfly ninja master on the weekends.

**[[[drclef-member-page |Clef]]]:** No.

++ Moderators

**[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/dr-arvind-desais-personnel-file |A Random Day]]]:** SCP Wiki in the streets, IRC chat in the sheets. Promoted to staff because people were too lazy to explain why he shouldn't be. Former editor of the SCP Site News, now captain of Community Outreach alongside his arch-nemesis [[user ProcyonLotor]]. Resident expert on clinical tone - he even wrote [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/clinical-tone-declassified |the guide on it]]].

**[[[accelerando-personnel-file|Accelerando]]]:** Resident tagger of articles and music --aficionado-- dilettante. His attention span keeps him away from chat, and usually drops in once every 3 months before zipping back into the void. Highly willing to discuss and brainstorm article ideas (or albums) through PMs.

**[[user ChaoSera]]:** Also answers to Chao, Sera and "that nerd in the corner". Can answer most Computer Science and Robotics related questions. Usually available in IRC and via PM. Has been made mod but nobody really knows why. Foul play is strongly suspected but witnesses keep mysteriously disappearing.

**[[[dr-magnus-personnel-file | DrMagnus]]]:** Most easily available via Wiki PM.  Current captain of the technical team, and Black Lion of the tech team voltron.  Teaches Historical Fencing, has three black belts, odd obsession with fountain pens + paper, and is in to tea.  Has been around the site //forever// and probably remembers whoever you're talking about.  Don't hesitate to reach out if there's a tech issue.

**[[[researcher-conwell-s-personnel-file|Jacob Conwell]]]:** After being hand crafted in Portland, Oregon, Conwell came to the wiki to write about robots, lasers, and people who make robots both with and without lasers. He’s usually in the chat, and is happy to look at drafts of all kinds. He’s better used for developing ideas than for fixing grammar, because words are hard.

**[[[leveritas-personnel-file|Leveritas]]]:** If Leveritas isn't in the [http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/c-50864/help:drafts-and-critiques drafts and critiques forum], call somebody. Currently the moderator pruning the [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/experiment-log-914 |experiment log for SCP-914]]] (don't PM him to ask if your entry will be good, makes him very cranky). Especially enjoys drafts with a strong sub-narrative. He's also fluent in Dutch, if you need that for some reason.

**[[[workers-of-the-world-unite |LilyFlower]]]:** When she's not organising a revolution or deleting copyrighted images, Lily can be messaged for help with biology (particularly zoology), socialism, queer stuff, and licensing. Always in #site19 and checks her wikidot PMs regularly. Ask her about her music tastes.

**[[[scp-mayday-j|Mayday]]]:** Mayday, also known as MayD, is almost always around and will generally respond to most Wikidot PMs and IRC Messages. They have an almost encyclopedic knowledge on film, film history, and literature and about as much knowledge on site culture, history, and lore. They'll generally try to answer any question asked. 

**[http://www.scp-wiki.net/modern-erasmus-author-page Modern_Erasmus]:** More like Mod-ern Erasmus am I right? Erasmus tends to write about either deep historical mysteries or low quality puns. The Black Moon Howls with laughter at his dad jokes. Whether you need critique, crosslinks, reddit moderation, or rewrites, Erasmus is your guy. 

**[[user ProcyonLotor]]:** is the only raccoon currently on staff, and thus the coolest one by default. He can appear grumpy at times, but in reality he's just a fan of whining and hyperbole. One of the chief licensing dorks, and always happy to answer questions about Creative Commons.

**[[[bluesoul-s-author-page| pxdnbluesoul]]]:** Professional IT by day, and actually professional IT by night as well. Operates several services including the scp.bz link shortener and S-CSS-P browser addon, and is an IRCOP and server administrator for SynIRC, our home. Runs a podcast and makes merch. Can answer questions about wiki formatting and usage, IRC, and most other technical aspects of the wiki universe.

**[[[randomini|Randomini]]]:** will shout at you for not doing enough conceptual development, or help fix your CSS or JS shenanigans. Recommends the Characters Killed Per Paragraph (CK/P) as a metric for high-quality writing.

**[[[Rat Lord|Rat Lord]]]:** Despite their repeated claims to be "The Giant Rat who makes all of the rules," little evidence has been found to verify any of these claims. As far as anyone can tell, they're at most a normal sized rat with a cardboard crown. Further research is required. 

**[[[Dr. Adileh Khayyam's Personnel File|Taffeta]]]:** This is Taffeta. They've got your back. They could crit all your drafts in one paragraph. I would advise not getting downvoted by them -- their forum posts trap the threads of their victims.

**[[[tuomey-author-page|Tuomey]]]:** Juggles responsibilities, balls, and clubs - sometimes all at the same time. Celtic takeover now in progress. Frequently found lurking in IRC.

**[[[vincent-redgrave-s-author-page |Vincent_Redgrave]]]:** Vince is a graphic designer/marketing analyst in training and a fountain of nerd culture and useless general trivia. He's also an SCP wiki hype-man who helps run the [https://www.facebook.com/scpfoundation Official SCP Foundation Facebook Page] and wants you to go 'like' it this instant. Contact him if you need help with a story, with editing an image, or want to learn who 'Booster Gold' is or why Helvetica is literally the worst font.

**[[[wrongjohnsilver-s-author-page|WrongJohnSilver]]]:** WrongJohnSilver is known for his penchant for cufflinks and tie clips, providing patient, high-level draft critique, and the ability to be unfazed by any topic. He's the sort of person who can go from vacationing in a German spa town, to dodging the city watch and a zombie invasion on the streets of Prague within the week. Ask him about his extensive wine collection, or if you would like to rewrite an article.

++ Operational Staff

**[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/a-wild-alces-alces-is-plugging|Alces_alces]]]:** Local crazy horse lady who only comes out of the barn for an occasional cup of coffee and forum critique. Most easily contacted via discord and wikidot pms.

**[[[captain-kirby-s-personal-file|Captain Kirby]]]:** Not as famous as the video game character, but appears in chat and on the forums more often. Also known for complaining about Computers, Robots, and Other Things He Deals With On A Daily Basis. Most easily contacted on IRC and wikidot PMs. And before you ask, yes, I did put valuable time and energy into making this witty. Thanks for noticing.

**[[[cone|Croquembouche]]]:** Knows things about CSS and ListPages. Changed the password to the coffee machine in the staff room and won't tell anyone what it is. Deals format screws in dark alleyways from trenchcoat pockets. The trenchcoat is also for sale.

**[[user Dankaar]]:** Another staffer who is mostly under the radar, the rarely spotted dankaar is Good With Critique.

**[[[Dr Bleeps Author Page| DrBleep]]]:** Most easily reached via IRC, or PM. Is a career Microbiologist, working towards graduate school, knowledgeable in most topics involving bacteria and viruses. Avid gamer, part of the Wikiwalk team. Staff member in other communities not involved with SCP. Sometimes on a full moon when they aren't running mad science, they are available to give critt.

**[[[fantem-s-poi-file |Fantem]]]:** Regularly found answering weird questions on the official tumblr, Fantem is a known bun and is to be apprehended on sight.

**[[[fieldstone-ao-file|fieldstone]]]:** Gives mostly solid advice in forum crit and posts randomly in other places. Also works on site news. Will almost always respond to PMs... eventually. --Sometimes-- disappears suddenly from IRC for spouse/parent duty. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_behavior_support Mental health professional.] Cares a lot about making sure people feel welcome here, and about this whole thing in general.

**[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/fingo7-s-cute-stuff|Fingo7]]]:** Possible ladybug with a [http://www.scp-wiki.net/fingo7-s-art-i-guess-3 drawing tablet] and a green tea addiction that's somehow an active occultist, a decently-read Marxist, and an exotic millipede hobbyist all at once. Send him a Wikidot message or talk to him on IRC if you need (urgent) occult advice or just any kind of crit/brainstorming help. Secretly planning a site-wide takeover with his comrade, Lily.

**[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/gabriel-jade|Gabriel Jade]]]:** Friendly neighborhood hermit.  Eldritch binding magics may be used to compel this creature to provide critique on drafts.

**[[[jr-psych-chibis-personnel-file|ghostchibi]]]:** Also goes by Blake or Maxson on IRC, because why not be as confusing as godly possible. Answers asks on the serious official SCP tumblr blog, kicks down the door to #site19 to come scream about stuff, and loves Fallout so much, so so much, listen it's a GOOD SERIES you guys I'm TELLING YOU IT'S

**[[user Joreth]]:** People think Joreth is a wolf - but he's actually a dog wearing a wolf hat. Believed to be made staff in a failed attempt to curb shitposting. Does Internet Outreach because no one wants him on the site.

**[[user LadyKatie]]:** LadyKatie is our primary staff member for translation work on the wiki, as well as our primary contact for the INT Community and the translation sites. She also helps around the forums, giving crit and offering advice. She has an excellent cat named Pepper. 

**[[[personnel-file-lyusternik-lazar|Lazar]]]:** Draft critter. Idea critter. Possibly swamp critter. Can be found frequenting IRC and forums. Keeps a watchful eye on draft and idea forums to poach unsuspecting posts.

**[[user Mistbourne]]:** "The Man with the Red Pen", his grammarian tendencies tend to result in much nitpicking of the use of the English language.  Enjoys thunderstorms, mowing his lawn and gently correcting poor critique.

**[[user MrAnakinSpecter]]:** Master of ghosts and terrible jokes. Might one day finally one-up Tuomey, but it is unlikely.

**[[[wrong-analytics|MrWrong]]]:** Apparently the only staff member from Asia (specifically, Singapore) and alleged Japanophile (who //really// should try to venture out of articles based on Japanese cultural anecdotes). While he has written many articles, the ratings are admittedly not spectacular (SunnyClockwork attributes that to a lack of "plugging", so here's another avenue). Will be willing to look through drafts if asked to. Prefers to engage the site via a laptop. 

**[[user Shaggydredlocks]]:** Shaggy is currently helping with a ton of projects and initiatives for the wiki. He's a moderator on our reddit, as well as leading the charge on the User-Curated lists project. 

**[http://www.scp-wiki.net/sly161-s-author-page Sly161]:** Sly is a forum critter, they help run one of the Tumblr blogs, a fan of horror, and is an up and coming forensic investigator. You can come to them if you need crit on a draft. You can find them in 17 or #thecritters, and they will always try to answer Wikidot PMs.

**[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/dr-solo-s-personnel-file Dr Solo]:** Solo's usually around in 19, 17, or any of the hundred million unofficial side chats to lend a hand with crit and tell you that evolution doesn't work the way you think it does. You may know him as the author of such hits such as "the mayo one", "the potato one", and "the skeleton one".

**[[user subtletea]]:** The fastest pun in the west who would love to hear about your pets. Majors in wildlife bio. Is a bit of a homebody, and does not in fact have a wild life, unless you count seal rescue and horseshoe crab tagging. There's plenty of bio.  Come find them running the SCP dA or on the IRC chat! 

**[[user taylor_itkin]]:** Resident guitarist/singer, Operational Staff of the Forum Criticism Team, Community Outreach, Internet Outreach, and Chat Staff. Most easily reachable through IRC, but checks his wikidot inbox too. Sometimes does a podcast called [http://www.scp-wiki.net/author-s-corner-podcast-hub Author's Corner] that is sometimes pretty awesome. Likes dogs and also guitars and food. You look cute today <3

**[[user TSATPWTCOTTTADC]]:** Probably more human than ro[!--She knows.--]bot, probably doesn't sleep. Finds and takes care of lots of little tasks and projects around the wiki that got forgotten and left by the wayside of bigger things. Has a hard time saying no to orphaned pages in need of a loving home. 

**[[user Uncle Nicolini]]:** Possibly one of the more easy-going people on staff. On Community Outreach and Forum Crit teams. Is a GoI Extraordinaire, certified teddy bear, and bonified buffoon. Is also a member of Tech Team on the Spanish Wiki. Yeehaw, friends! 🤠🤠🤠

**[[[UraniumEmpire]]]:** Resident indie trash cat. Contact her for crit, suggestions, writing help on pieces that tackle Judaism/Computers/Music/Anarcho-Syndicalism, and that cool bug pic you wanted to share with everyone.

**[[[wogglebug-author-page|Wogglebug]]]:** Wogglebug is some guys who woggles, and definitely not a robot of some description. A fan of oldish books and coolish names, he's very much interested in both your article and you as a person. Tends to hang around Site19, and is (almost) always available for help with drafts on tales and SCPs. Rather great at editing.

**[[[the-file-of-an-acid-junkie-college-flunky-dirty-puppy-daddy |Zachary Maxwell]]]** is Acid Junkie College Flunky Dirty Puppy Daddy Bastard who will check your draft, fix your grammar, and link to useful stuff, when he's not selling lavender and wildflowers on Brighton beach.
