title:Meet The Staff
[[div class="content-panel standalone series"]]

++ Senior Staff and You

These are the people who are assigned responsibilities on the site. It's their job to help keep the site running as smoothly and as well as possible. Most of uthem are veterans, with experience built up from the time spent here. Here's a small dossier to help show who the senior staff are.

**Note:** You are expected to know who staff are when you encounter them "in the wild", because you have to know when to listen to them. You don't have to memorize or even thoroughly read these bios. But you do have to know which people are staff.

PS: Yes, these are tongue-in-cheek, but they're still true, so don't be surprised. We warned you.

++ Administrators

* **[[[dr-bright-s-personnel-file |Bright]]]:** A self described "crotchety old man", so beware. He's blunt and crude, but always working for the best. Reads almost every article there is, and has been reliably active longer than any other present administrator. He is not now, nor has he ever been in recent memory, a monkey. 

* **[[[drclef-member-page |Clef]]]:** Rumor has it, Clef has no penis, just another hand, holding a gun. Clef may come off brusque, but he only has the good of the site in mind. Don't kiss up to him, or he'll probably shoot you in the face. A tip: when Serious Clef speaks, you better listen. Also spearheading the nascent Global Occult Coalition sub-wiki, so if you're more interested in shooting werewolves to save the Earth, you may want to talk to him.

* **[[[drewbear-personnel-file|Drewbear]]]:** As Waxx said, "A bear is just a man who made a choice." (wait, Burns already did this joke. Damn.) Will likely not maul you, despite the name. Actually does want you and your articles to succeed, but won't pull punches if the piece in question is seriously flawed. Erratically shows up in chat, but responds to PMs fairly quickly. //WILL// ding you for getting your science precepts wrong.

* **[[[dr-manns-personnel-file |Dr. Mann]]]:** A pretty cool guy, and a great writer. He's got a very impressive creative mind, [[[One Bad Mother| though sometimes it's used for evil.]]] He's also sometimes a GM. Runs the [http://wanderers-library.wikidot.com Wanderers Library].

* **[[[photosynthetics-personnel-file |Photosynthetic]]]:** One of our resident scientists. Can you guess what her specialty is? In any case, she's very helpful, and great with science; if you need to science up an article, she's a great person to ask. We can neither confirm nor deny whether she possesses anomalous sun-powered eldritch abilities.

* **[[[the-deadly-moose-personnel-file |TheDeadlyMoose]]]:** Kind of sassy, but has a good eye for what works. Good editor and rewriter. Reads every posted article on the site (eventually) and has a tendency to leave lots of criticism. Likes anthropology, psychology, gender, and sexuality. Administrator at the [http://wanderers-library.wikidot.com Wanderers Library]. Current [[[Chat Guide|chat owner of #site19]]]; also helps run public staff chat ([http://05command.wikidot.com/chat #site17]). Will answer almost any question you care to ask, including on site administration.

* **[[[agent-lament-s-personnel-file |TroyL]]]:** A great guy, and a better writer. TroyL is known for quality work, and you'll recognize his stuff when you see it. Puts a hell of a lot into the site. Troy is the admin among admins, the guy who gets shit done. If you have a problem, talk to him. And read his stuff while you're at it (especially if you see this sentence before Troy notices it and deletes it).

++ Moderators

* **[[[crayne-author|Crayne]]]:** Hailing from the land of cheese and tulips, Crayne's a father, a husband, owner of Mortis, the Loggerhead musk turtle destined to destroy this reality and the next, and also rather old. Does not have a lawn, but if he did, he'd love to chase kids off of it. Trained in information sciences and always willing to help out with a draft. Crayne's also addicted to Cote d'Or milk chocolate bars, just so you know.

* **[[[mr-eskobar |Eskobar]]]:** Eskobar is a graduate student in training to be a high school history teacher, a landscaper, a husband, a father, and probably one of the nicer mods who can review a draft, all things considered. Will defend the indefensible, write the unreadable, and say the unspeakable. Most likely to correct your [[[zen-and-the-art-of-data-expunged |redactions]]] using unnecessarily elaborate analogies. Goes by Eskobear in chat.

* **[[[gaffney-s-personnel-file |Gaffney]]]:** An alright guy who's inexplicably a mod at [http://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/ The Wanderer's Library]. Will pick apart your phrasing, but can usually give at least one suggestion on how make your article more interesting. Goes by "Gaffsey" in chat for really stupid reasons.

* **[[[dr-frederick-heiden |Heiden]]]:** One of the nice guys. Somewhat approachable, vaguely acerbic if you're too dumb. Good at what he does, but not able to be as active as he used to be. Good eye for developing concepts.

* **[[[dr-trebuchet-s-personnel-file |Pig_catapult]]]:** Pig's been here a while, and generally has a good instinct for whether an idea will go over well. She might not say much most of the time, but she's usually just a ping or private message away, and is almost always ready to give some constructive criticism. She's a stickler for grammar, spelling, and punctuation, so if you need another set of eyes to help proofread your article, just ask.

* **[[[dr-rogets-file|Roget]]]:** The lil' Stalin himself. Very active, and willing to help people out, if you send him a PM. Tries to answer every wikidot PM sent to him... eventually. Currently in charge of the [http://scp-foundation-origins.wikidot.com/ Foundation Origins] SCP role-playing game, and moderates the [http://wanderers-library.wikidot.com Wanderer's Library]. He's also written the [http://www.scp-wiki.net/history-of-the-universe-hub History Of The SCP Foundation] essay series, so he's the best person to ask questions about site history.

* **[[[silberescher-personnel-file | Silberescher]]]:** Alias Silber. Pretty much everything he says is tongue-in-cheek or sarcastic. Remember that, and you'll get along with him well. Gives solid advice, and is an exceptional writer, even if he doesn't think he is (just read his writing). Also, kind of into comics and CCGs. Ask him about his SCP Magic Expansion.

* **[[[dr-light-s-personnel-file |Sophia Light]]]:** //Admin emerita.// Dubiously well educated, and constructive in her criticisms. She's been around the site for a long time, and is (one of) our resident biologist(s). She can help with sciencey things, or questions about jellyfish.

* **[[[doctor-s-s-personnel-file| SoullessSingularity]]]:** Most likely to want to touch your eyes. Quirky and odd as a rule with a passion for the written creepy, but he's generally harmless. Considered to be a good writer and great at critique. If you can find him through wikidot PM or #site19, he'll be happy to look drafts and ideas over.

* **[http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/vivax Vivax]:** He's the secret mod; you have to beat the wiki on Expert Level without taking any damage to unlock him. Nobody knows who he is or what he does aside from //science// and //strangeness//. Also a mod over on the [http://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/ Wanderer's Library]. Feel free to ask him for review. Be warned, you never have enough characterization. 

* **[[[researcher-zyn-s-personnel-file |Zyn]]]:** Psychology and social behavior student (formerly biology), [http://www.scp-wiki.net/into-that-good-night poetry enthusiast], part-time violin tutor, and butterfly caretaker (generally of //Nymphalis antiopa//, in the spring), Zyn is readily available for answering of questions in the IRC (send her a private message, or try #site17) and through wikidot PM. She can help if you want your articles to evoke non-scary emotions. Favors "Marp" as an onomatopoeia.

++ Operational Staff

* **[[[accelerando-personnel-file|Accelerando]]]:** Though he's somewhat argumentative, he's never late for dinner and he always wins at Monopoly. Has an affinity for tagging and listening to partially organized noise. His attention span keeps him away from chat, but a PM will get his attention if there's an idea needed to be discussed. Usually. 

* **[[[agent-alexander-azzleflux-fredricks-s-personnel-file|Azzleflux]]]:** Some punkass kid, probably. Tends to focus on the Drafts and Critique forums but is happy to look at anything if you draw his attention to it. Easier to reach via PM than in chat and prefers posting in your draft thread rather than discussing it in PMs. Doesn't really hold back in the critique process but really is a lot nicer than his critiques make him seem.

* **[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/dr-anborough-personnel-file|Doctor Anborough]]]:** Sardonic but generally a cool guy.  The site's resident Keter expert.  Can assist you with draft review, but does not like incomplete drafts.  Will scrub your grammar for you with his Bachelor's Degree in English.  Feel free to bring him questions on any Keter-related manners.

* **[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/bluesoul-s-author-page| bluesoul]]]:**   Specializes in networking and server technology by day. Punches bears and makes rap beats by night. Can answer most questions on computers as well as high- and low-level networking. Can review just about anything for tone.

* **[[[http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/bouncl| Bouncl:]]]** Sometimes goes by Imants. He's a nice guy with a good head on his shoulders. Not around so much anymore, but happy to help if you need something and he's around.

* **[[[mayreder-personnel-file |Faminepulse]]]:** The wiki's patron saint of nubs. Will enthusiastically help with photo manipulation (provided you offer him a draft of your writing), and works with an extremely fast turnaround. Good for writing convincing dialogue and interesting hooks. Moonlights as a butcher.

* **[[[kalinin-s-personnel-file | Kalinin]]]:** Explorer in the further regions of experience. Demon to some. Angel to others. Depending on what you do to summon him. At some point in your career on the wiki, he will downvote something you wrote, but don't take it personally. Works in government and politics. A thorough and unsparing critic.  

* **[[[mister-flames | MisterFlames]]]:** Old, crotchety, and possessing a beard made of barbed wire, MisterFlames can be relied upon to give frank advice on readability and entertainment. If you can convince him to put down the hot peppers.

* **[[[researcher-slaw-s-personnel-file |murphy_slaw]]]** periodically shows up in #site19, yells something inane, and then leaves. Not around as much, but if you catch him, can give decent critique if you don't mind being laughed at. A cornucopia of useless trivia. System administrator by trade, but will not help you fix your computer. Does mostly behind the scenes work on technical staff.

* **[http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/nioki Nioki]:** Rarely seen, seldom heard, available in PMs if you need help proofreading or brainstorming. Better with stories than SCP entries.

* **[http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/procyonlotor ProcyonLotor]** is the only raccoon currently on staff, and thus the coolest one by default. He can appear grumpy at times, but in reality he's just a fan of whining and hyperbole. Real good with history, politics, and proofreading drafts. Procyon can nearly always be found on chat, and will review pretty much anything if asked.

* **[[[Reject]]]:** Very approachable. Always responds to PMs, especially from newbies, and usually does so quickly. Will help you with whatever you need help with. Excels at making stupid jokes and listens to far too much hip-hop.

* **[http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/RhettSarlin RhettSarlin]** is one of the older members and reads pretty much every damn thing on the wiki. He has excellent taste and is basically what you get when you put a lurker through 914 on Very Fine. Able to assess any idea and give you a realistic prediction of how well it will do. Less around these days, but if you can catch him on chat, will jump at the chance to proofread your article if you let him.

* **[http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/Riemann Riemann]** is the resident weizhong wrangler, physics major and spontaneity planner. Easy going, puntastic, never serious and a fan of grouping things in 3, he still doesn't understand that most people don't want to hear about the Existence and Mass Gap and will talk your ear off about physics unless you guess the magic phrase. There's no evidence that actually listening affects the length of his rambling. Reports that Riemann devours the souls of textbooks in order to gain their power are unconfirmed, though probably true.

* **[http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/rumetzen rumetzen]:** Medic wunderkind. Doesn't actually hate you as much as he lets on. Almost always lurking in chat, and always happy to look at drafts or just shoot the shit. A decent source of medical and military knowledge, so if you need any of that fact checked he's a good guy to go to. Also a mod at the Wanderer's Library and will show up at awkward times if you mention it.

* **[[[spikebrennan-s-personnel-file |Spikebrennan]]]:** Avuncular, cerebral, and probably older than you.  Also, a lawyer.  More interested in science fiction than horror. Not as much around anymore, but if you catch him on the chat, pitch your draft of your work to him: he is often willing to offer constructive criticism.

* **[http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/Tuomey Tuomey]:** Snarky and likely to challenge you to "fite me irl", Tuomey is usually found on chat pretending to ban everyone.

* **[[[vincent-redgrave-s-author-page |Vincent_Redgrave]]]:** Vince is a graphic designer/marketing analyst in training and a fountain of nerd culture and useless general trivia. He's also an SCP wiki hype-man who helps run the [https://www.facebook.com/scpfoundation Official SCP Foundation Facebook Page] and wants you to go 'like' it this instant. Contact him if you need help with a story, with editing an image, or want to learn who 'Booster Gold' is or why Helvetica is literally the worst font.

* **[[[weizhong | weizhong]]]:** Weizhong might come across as the consummate professional, but don't let his sharp suits and strong jaw fool you. Weizhong once called The Administrator just to say "Is your refrigerator running?" He showed up at O5-7's house and let a greased pig in through the bedroom window. He has a pointless amount of knowledge in many topics and is a helpful member of staff (and also mods [[[http://www.reddit.com/r/scp |/r/scp]]]!), but don't let yer guard down, because BAM! That's when he'll getcha. Greased pig, every time.

* **[[[wogglebug-author-page|Wogglebug]]]:** Wogglebug is some guys who woggles, and definitely not a robot of some description. A fan of oldish books and coolish names, he's very much interested in both your article and you as a person. Tends to hang around Site19, and is (almost) always available for help with drafts on tales and SCPs. Rather great at editing.
