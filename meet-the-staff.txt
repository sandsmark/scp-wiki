title:Meet The Staff
[[div class="content-panel standalone series" style="background-color: #ffffeb;"]]

++ Senior Staff and You

These are the people who are assigned responsibilities on the site. It's their job to help keep the site running as smoothly and as well as possible. Most of them are veterans, with experience built up from the time spent here. Here's a small dossier to help show who the senior staff are. **If you have an issue for staff to address, please refer to the [[[Contact Staff]]] page.**

**Note:** You are expected to know who staff are when you encounter them "in the wild", because you have to know when to listen to them. You don't have to memorize or even thoroughly read these bios. But you do have to know which people are staff.

PS: Yes, these are tongue-in-cheek, but they're still true, so don't be surprised. We warned you.

++ Administrators

**[[[drclef-member-page |Clef]]]:** Rumor has it, Clef has no penis, just another hand, holding a gun. Clef may come off brusque, but he only has the good of the site in mind. Don't kiss up to him, or he'll probably shoot you in the face. A tip: when Serious Clef speaks, you better listen. Also spearheads the Global Occult Coalition storyline/canon, so if you're more interested in shooting werewolves to save the Earth, you may want to talk to him.

**[[[drewbear-personnel-file|Drewbear]]]:** As Waxx said, "A bear is just a man who made a choice." (wait, Burns already did this joke. Damn.) Will likely not maul you, despite the name. Actually does want you and your articles to succeed, but won't pull punches if the piece in question is seriously flawed. Erratically shows up in chat, but responds to PMs fairly quickly. //WILL// ding you for getting your science precepts wrong.

**[[[dr-manns-personnel-file |Dr. Mann]]]:** A pretty cool guy, and a great writer. He's got a very impressive creative mind, [[[One Bad Mother| though sometimes it's used for evil.]]] Good choice for asking military-related questions. Also runs the [http://wanderers-library.wikidot.com Wanderers Library].

**[[[photosynthetics-personnel-file |Photosynthetic]]]:** One of our resident scientists. Can you guess what her specialty is? In any case, she's very helpful, and great with science; if you need to science up an article, she's a great person to ask. We can neither confirm nor deny whether she possesses anomalous sun-powered eldritch abilities.

**[[[quikngruvn-personnel-file |Quikngruvn]]]:** A cynical but generally easy-going old fart (born during Nixon's second term). By and large out of the critique business, but he's willing (and sometimes able) to answer specific questions in chat. Holds a degree in chemistry, is a sysadmin by trade, and is a fan of trivia. Has an affinity for sarcasm and puns. Occasionally goes by Teratophobia in chat.

**[[[dr-snorlison-s-personnel-file |snorlison]]]:** Recently returned from a long hiatus. Friendly and often lurking in chat. Will probably get a longer chunk of text later!

**[[[the-deadly-moose-personnel-file |TheDeadlyMoose]]]:** Kind of sassy, but has a good eye for what works. Said to be a good editor. Has a tendency to leave lots of criticism. Likes talking about anthropology, psychology (ish), gender, and sexuality. Token admin of non-binary-gender (usually 'they'/'zie' pronouns). Admin at the [http://wanderers-library.wikidot.com Wanderers Library]. Current [[[Chat Guide|chat owner of #site19]]] and help chat ([http://05command.wikidot.com/chat #site17]). Will answer almost any question you care to ask.

**[[[dr-bright-s-personnel-file |TheDuckman]]]:** A.K.A. Bright. A self described "crotchety old man", so beware. He's blunt and crude, but always working for the best. Has been reliably active longer than any other present administrator. He is not now, nor has he ever been in recent memory, a monkey. 

**[[[agent-lament-s-personnel-file |TroyL]]]:** A great guy, and a better writer. TroyL is known for quality work, and you'll recognize his stuff when you see it. Puts a hell of a lot into the site. Troy is the admin among admins, the one who gets shit done. If you have a problem, talk to him. Also talk to him if you're interested in becoming staff. And read his stuff while you're at it (especially if you see this sentence before Troy notices it and deletes it again).

++ Moderators

**[[[anqxyr]]]:** The sneakiest and one of the most tech savvy mods. Rumour has it he coded djkaktus from three lines of BASIC and stolen Wikidot APIs. He's got good taste in TV shows and friends (his thoughts on Friends are still unconfirmed though). He headed up the SCP ebook and other even more awesome and secret projects.

**[[user Bouncl]]:** Sometimes goes by Imants. He's a nice guy with a good head on his shoulders. Not around as much, but happy to help if you need something and he's around.

**[[[decibelle|Decibelles]]]:** Decibelle is Team Captain for Community Outreach, Rewrite, Ambassador and Mom (although she is not a mom herself). Rumor has it she makes sick beats, but current sightings of said sick beats are as of yet unconfirmed. She is most likely to be on IRC, but not too talkative. She also would like everyone to read the [http://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/ Wanderer's Library] and participate there, because why not? Have a nice day!

**[[[dr-django-bridge-personnel-file |Dexanote]]]:** Canadian Pokemon Master. Good at brainstorming and expanding on ideas, not so great when it comes to rewrites and refining failed drafts. Excellent at grammar and phrasing. Possibly part hobbit. Has not, in fact, caught them all.

**[[[dr-frederick-heiden |Heiden]]]:** One of the nice guys. Somewhat approachable, vaguely acerbic if you're too dumb. Good at what he does, but not able to be as active as he used to be. Good eye for developing concepts.

**[[[lurk-d-s-personnel-file |LurkD]]]:** Some say, that she is one of the protons in the Large Hadron Collider, and that she creates miniature black holes every time she sneezes. Some say she was the one who actually pulled Excalibur from the stone and that she is the rightful king of England. All we know is she's called --the Stig-- LurkD! Enigmatic formatting guru and mysteriously helpful lurker in chat, it is said that those who survive an encounter with LurkD are --usually better off for it-- doomed to a most terrible fate.

**[[[dr-trebuchet-s-personnel-file |Pig_catapult]]]:** Pig's been here a while, and generally has a good instinct for whether an idea will go over well. She might not say much most of the time, but she's usually just a ping or private message away, and is almost always ready to give some constructive criticism. She's a stickler for grammar, spelling, and punctuation, so if you need another set of eyes to help proofread your article, just ask.

**[[user ProcyonLotor]]** is the only raccoon currently on staff, and thus the coolest one by default. He can appear grumpy at times, but in reality he's just a fan of whining and hyperbole. One of the chief licensing dorks, and always happy to answer questions about Creative Commons.

**[[[dr-rogets-file|Roget]]]:** The lil' Stalin himself. Very active, and willing to help people out, if you send him a PM. Tries to answer every wikidot PM sent to him... eventually. Currently in charge of the [http://scp-foundation-origins.wikidot.com/ Foundation Origins] SCP role-playing game, and moderates the [http://wanderers-library.wikidot.com Wanderer's Library]. He's also written the [http://www.scp-wiki.net/history-of-the-universe-hub History Of The SCP Foundation] essay series, so he's the best person to ask questions about site history.

**[[[silberescher-personnel-file | Silberescher]]]:** Alias Silber. Pretty much everything he says is tongue-in-cheek or sarcastic. Remember that, and you'll get along with him well. Gives solid advice, and is an exceptional writer, even if he doesn't think he is (just read his writing). Also, kind of into comics and CCGs. Ask him about his SCP Magic Expansion.

**[[[dr-light-s-personnel-file |Sophia Light]]]:** //Admin emerita.// Dubiously well educated, and constructive in her criticisms. She's been around the site for a long time, and is (one of) our resident biologist(s). She can help with sciencey things, or questions about jellyfish.

**[[[doctor-s-s-personnel-file| SoullessSingularity]]]:** Most likely to want to touch your eyes. Quirky and odd as a rule with a passion for the written creepy, but he's generally harmless. Considered to be a good writer and great at critique. If you can find him through wikidot PM or #site19, he'll be happy to look drafts and ideas over.

**[[user Vivax]]:** He's the secret mod; you have to beat the wiki on Expert Level without taking any damage to unlock him. Nobody knows who he is or what he does aside from //science// and //strangeness//. Also a mod over on the [http://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/ Wanderer's Library]. Feel free to ask him for review. Be warned, you never have enough characterization. 

**[[[researcher-zyn-s-personnel-file |Zyn]]]:** Psychology and social behavior student (formerly biology), [http://www.scp-wiki.net/into-that-good-night poetry enthusiast], part-time violin tutor, and butterfly caretaker (generally of //Nymphalis antiopa//, in the spring), Zyn is readily available for answering of questions in the IRC (send her a private message, or try #site17) and through wikidot PM. She can help if you want your articles to evoke non-scary emotions. Favors "Marp" as an onomatopoeia.

++ Operational Staff

**[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/dr-arvind-desais-personnel-file |A Random Day]]]:** SCP Wiki in the streets, IRC chat in the sheets. According to him, his tales and SCPs are criminally underrated. According to everyone else, they're criminally overrated. Promoted to staff because people were too lazy to explain why he shouldn't be. Derives all his self-worth from fixing spelling, grammatical, tonal, and conceptual errors and will critique drafts if asked. 

**[[[accelerando-personnel-file|Accelerando]]]:** Even though he's somewhat indecisive, Accel is never late for dinner and always wins in Monopoly. Has an affinity for tagging articles and listening to partially organized noise. His attention span keeps him away from chat, but a PM will get his attention if there's an idea needed to be fleshed out or discussed. Usually. 

**[[user Blaroth]]:** AKA Roth. Probably not a cat. Runs the [http://scp-wiki-official.tumblr.com/ official tumblr] and a bunch of other things for Internet Outreach. Does way too much and is way too helpful.

**[[[bluesoul-s-author-page| bluesoul]]]:** Specializes in networking and server technology by day. Punches bears and makes rap beats by night. Can answer most questions on computers as well as high- and low-level networking. Can review just about anything for tone.

**[[[pastry-based-aquatic-life-form-p13f15h |ChrisAKAPiefish]]]:** ChrisAKAPiefish is possibly a pastry, possibly a fish, possibly both. He runs the [https://www.facebook.com/scpfoundation Official SCP Foundation Facebook Page] and also draws possibly the worst Microsoft Paint drawings of SCP's the world has ever seen. He's a Support Analyst mostly working with SQL, he's an avid gamer and can usually be found lurking in [http://www.scp-wiki.net/chat-guide IRC].

**[[[dr-burns-personnel-file |Burns:]]]** AKA Arlecchino. Wait, who the hell is this guy?

**[[[mayreder-personnel-file |Faminepulse]]]:** The wiki's patron saint of noobs. Known for speaking in non sequitur and writing some of the wiki's weirder articles. Will create images and audio for you if you can show him a good draft.

**[[[researcher-conwell-s-personnel-file|Jacob Conwell]]]:** After being hand crafted in the ironic wasteland that is Portland, Oregon, Conwell came to the wiki to write about robots, lasers, and people who make robots both with and without lasers. He’s usually in the chat, and is happy to look at drafts of all kinds. He’s better used for developing ideas than for fixing grammar, because words are hard.

**[[user Mistbourne]]:** "The Man with the Red Pen", his grammarian tendencies tend to result in much nitpicking of the use of the English language.  Enjoys thunderstorms, mowing his lawn and gently correcting poor critique.

**[[[mister-flames | MisterFlames]]]:** Old, crotchety, and possessing a beard made of barbed wire, MisterFlames can be relied upon to give frank advice on readability and entertainment. If you can convince him to put down the hot peppers.

**[http://www.scp-wiki.net/wrong-analytics MrWrong]:** A man from the island of Singapore and alleged Japanophile (who //really// should try to venture out of articles based on Japanese cultural anecdotes). While he has written many articles, the ratings are admittedly not spectacular (SunnyClockwork attributes that to a lack of "plugging"). Will be willing to look through drafts if asked to. Prefers to engage the site via a laptop. 

**[[user Nioki]]:** Rarely seen, seldom heard, available in PMs if you need help proofreading or brainstorming. Better with stories than SCP entries.

**[[user Pixeltasim]]** is that youngster almost always lurking in #site19, waiting for Alex to break. He maintains the chat bot Alexandra and will probably add requested features if you ask nicely. Also is staff over at the Wanderer's library and is happy to help you out with any computer or game development related questions. Always insists on bringing up that one article he wrote that was okay.  

**[[user RhettSarlin]]** is one of the older members and reads pretty much every damn thing on the wiki. He has excellent taste and is basically what you get when you put a lurker through 914 on Very Fine. Able to assess any idea and give you a realistic prediction of how well it will do. Less around these days, but if you can catch him on chat, will jump at the chance to proofread your article if you let him.

**[[[rumetzen-author-page| rumetzen]]]:** Medic wunderkind. Doesn't actually hate you as much as he lets on. Almost always lurking in chat, and always happy to look at drafts or just shoot the shit. A decent source of medical and military knowledge, so if you need any of that fact checked he's a good guy to go to. Also a mod at the Wanderer's Library and will show up at awkward times if you mention it.

**[[[spikebrennan-s-personnel-file |Spikebrennan]]]:** Avuncular, cerebral, and probably older than you.  Also, a lawyer.  More interested in science fiction than horror. Not as much around anymore, but if you catch him on the chat, pitch your draft of your work to him: he is often willing to offer constructive criticism.

**[[[tuomey-author-page|Tuomey]]]:** Oh god not this guy again. Kind of a dork? Juggles responsibilities, balls, and clubs - sometimes all at the same time.

**[[[vincent-redgrave-s-author-page |Vincent_Redgrave]]]:** Vince is a graphic designer/marketing analyst in training and a fountain of nerd culture and useless general trivia. He's also an SCP wiki hype-man who helps run the [https://www.facebook.com/scpfoundation Official SCP Foundation Facebook Page] and wants you to go 'like' it this instant. Contact him if you need help with a story, with editing an image, or want to learn who 'Booster Gold' is or why Helvetica is literally the worst font.

**[[[wogglebug-author-page|Wogglebug]]]:** Wogglebug is some guys who woggles, and definitely not a robot of some description. A fan of oldish books and coolish names, he's very much interested in both your article and you as a person. Tends to hang around Site19, and is (almost) always available for help with drafts on tales and SCPs. Rather great at editing.
