title:Meet The Staff
[[div class="content-panel standalone series" style="background-color: #ffffeb;"]]

++ Senior Staff and You

These are the people who are assigned responsibilities on the site. It's their job to help keep the site running as smoothly and as well as possible. Most of them are veterans, with experience built up from the time spent here. Here's a small dossier to help show who the senior staff are. **If you have an issue for staff to address, please refer to the [[[Contact Staff]]] page.**

**Note:** You are expected to know who staff are when you encounter them "in the wild", because you have to know when to listen to them. You don't have to memorize or even thoroughly read these bios. But you do have to know which people are staff.

PS: Yes, these are tongue-in-cheek, but they're still true, so don't be surprised. We warned you.

++ Administrators

**[[[decibelle|Decibelles]]]:** Decibelle is Ex-Team Captain for Community Outreach, Rewrite, Ambassador and Mom (although she is not a mom herself). Rumor has it she makes sick beats, but current sightings of said sick beats are as of yet unconfirmed. She is most likely to be on IRC, but not too talkative. She also can't shut up about anime or weed (or unfortunately, when high, both). She also would like everyone to read the [http://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/ Wanderer's Library] and participate there, because why not? Have a nice day!

**[[[dr-django-bridge-personnel-file |Dexanote]]]:** Canadian Pokemon Master. Good at brainstorming and expanding on ideas, not so great when it comes to rewrites and refining failed drafts. Excellent at grammar and phrasing. Possibly part hobbit. Has not, in fact, caught them all.

**[[[dr-manns-personnel-file |Dr. Mann]]]:** A pretty cool guy, and a great writer. He's got a very impressive creative mind, [[[One Bad Mother| though sometimes it's used for evil.]]] Good choice for asking military-related questions. Also runs the [http://wanderers-library.wikidot.com Wanderers Library].

**[[[quikngruvn-personnel-file |Quikngruvn]]]:** Not that quick and rarely ever groovin', he's a cynical but generally easy-going old fart (born in the 70s). By and large out of the critique business, but willing (and sometimes able) to answer specific questions in chat. Holds a degree in chemistry, is a developer by trade, and is a fan of trivia. Has an affinity for sarcasm and puns. Occasionally goes by Teratophobia in chat[[footnote]]Or, when feeling particularly edgy, [[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_grand_stellated_120-cell|GreatGrandStellated120Cell]]].[[/footnote]].

**[[[dr-rogets-file|Roget]]]:** The lil' Stalin himself. Very active, and willing to help people out, if you send him a PM. Tries to answer every wikidot PM sent to him... eventually. Wrote the [http://www.scp-wiki.net/history-of-the-universe-hub History Of The SCP Foundation] essay series, so he's the best person to ask questions about site history.

**[[[silberescher-personnel-file | Silberescher]]]:** Alias Silber. Pretty much everything he says is tongue-in-cheek or sarcastic. Remember that, and you'll get along with him well. Gives solid advice, and is an exceptional writer, even if he doesn't think he is (just read his writing). Also, kind of into comics and CCGs. Ask him about his SCP Magic Expansion.

**[[[doctor-s-s-personnel-file| SoullessSingularity]]]:** Quirky and bizarre --sometimes-- pretty much all the time, but mostly harmless. Soulless has an intense passion for horror, strong prose, and compelling fiction- and will be happy to help any drafts out in becoming these things! He'll gladly listen to just about anyone's concerns and can be waved down on the chat or in Private Message. Go ahead and ask him what 'lmapo' means.

**[[[the-deadly-moose-personnel-file |TheDeadlyMoose]]]:** Kind of sassy, but has a good eye for what works. A good editor. Has a tendency to leave lots of criticism when de-lurked. Likes anthropology, psychology, gender, and sexuality. Non-binary-gender (usually 'they' or 'zie/zir' pronouns). Admin at the [http://wanderers-library.wikidot.com Wanderers Library]. Current [[[Chat Guide|chat owner of #site19]]] (now a ceremonial position!) and help chat ([http://05command.wikidot.com/chat #site17]). Permanently on Reserve.

**[[[dr-bright-s-personnel-file |TheDuckman]]]:** A.K.A. Bright. A self described "crotchety old man", so beware. He's blunt and crude, but always working for the best. Has been reliably active longer than any other present administrator. He is not now, nor has he ever been in recent memory, a monkey. 

**[[[researcher-zyn-s-personnel-file |Zyn]]]:** Psychology and social behavior major (formerly biology), [http://www.scp-wiki.net/into-that-good-night poetry enthusiast], part-time violin tutor, and butterfly caretaker (generally of //Nymphalis antiopa//, in the spring), Zyn is readily available for answering of questions in the IRC (send her a private message, or try #thecritters) and through wikidot PM. She can help if you want your articles to evoke non-scary emotions. Favors "Marp" as an onomatopoeia. Is kaiju butterfly ninja master on the weekends.

**[[[drclef-member-page |Clef]]]:** No.

++ Moderators

**[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/dr-arvind-desais-personnel-file |A Random Day]]]:** SCP Wiki in the streets, IRC chat in the sheets. Promoted to staff because people were too lazy to explain why he shouldn't be. Inordinately proud of editing the SCP Site News. Resident expert on clinical tone - he even wrote [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/clinical-tone-declassified |the guide on it]]].

**[[[accelerando-personnel-file|Accelerando]]]:** Resident tagger of articles and music --aficionado-- dilettante. His attention span keeps him away from chat, and usually drops in once every 3 months before zipping back into the void. Highly willing to discuss and brainstorm article ideas (or albums) through PMs.

**[[user ChaoSera]]:** Also answers to Chao, Sera and "that nerd in the corner". Can answer most Computer Science and Robotics related questions. Usually available in IRC and via PM. Has been made mod but nobody really knows why. Foul play is strongly suspected but witnesses keep mysteriously disappearing.

**[[[dr-magnus-personnel-file | DrMagnus]]]:** Most easily available via Wiki PM.  Current captain of the technical team, and Black Lion of the tech team voltron.  Teaches Historical Fencing, has three black belts, odd obsession with fountain pens + paper, and is in to tea.  Has been around the site //forever// and probably remembers whoever you're talking about.  Don't hesitate to reach out if there's a tech issue.

**[[[researcher-conwell-s-personnel-file|Jacob Conwell]]]:** After being hand crafted in Portland, Oregon, Conwell came to the wiki to write about robots, lasers, and people who make robots both with and without lasers. He’s usually in the chat, and is happy to look at drafts of all kinds. He’s better used for developing ideas than for fixing grammar, because words are hard.

**[[[leveritas-personnel-file|Leveritas]]]:** If Leveritas isn't in the [http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/c-50864/help:drafts-and-critiques drafts and critiques forum], call somebody. Currently the moderator pruning the [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/experiment-log-914 |experiment log for SCP-914]]]. Especially enjoys drafts with a strong sub-narrative. He's also fluent in Dutch, if you need that for some reason.

**[[[workers-of-the-world-unite |LilyFlower]]]:** Comrade Lily is now a Mod! She's happy to help with whatever you need as long as you //source your goddamn images//. Literally always on IRC, or send her a Wikidot PM. Always up to chat if you want, too! Officially ##red|G####orange|A####yellow|Y####green|E####blue|S####purple|T## staff member.

**[http://www.scp-wiki.net/modern-erasmus-author-page Modern_Erasmus]:** More like Mod-ern Erasmus am I right? Erasmus tends to write about either deep historical mysteries or low quality puns. The Black Moon Howls with laughter at his dad jokes. Whether you need critique, crosslinks, reddit moderation, or rewrites, Erasmus is your guy. 

**[[user ProcyonLotor]]:** is the only raccoon currently on staff, and thus the coolest one by default. He can appear grumpy at times, but in reality he's just a fan of whining and hyperbole. One of the chief licensing dorks, and always happy to answer questions about Creative Commons.

**[[[bluesoul-s-author-page| pxdnbluesoul]]]:** Professional IT by day, and actually professional IT by night as well. Operates several services including the scp.bz link shortener and S-CSS-P browser addon, and is an IRCOP and server administrator for SynIRC, our home. Heads up moderating on the /r/SCP subreddit. Can answer questions about wiki formatting and usage, IRC, and most other technical aspects of the wiki universe.

**[[[randomini|Randomini]]]:** will shout at you for not doing enough conceptual development, or help fix your CSS or JS shenanigans. Recommends the Characters Killed Per Paragraph (CK/P) as a metric for high-quality writing.

**[[[Dr. Adileh Khayyam's Personnel File|Taffeta]]]:** This is Taffeta. They've got your back. They could crit all your drafts in one paragraph. I would advise not getting downvoted by them -- their forum posts trap the threads of their victims.

**[[[scp-tretter-j|tretter]]]:** tretter's almost always around and will generally respond to most Wikidot PMs and IRC Messages. He has an almost encyclopedic knowledge on film and film history and about as much knowledge on site culture, history, and lore. He'll generally try to answer any question asked of him. 

**[[[tuomey-author-page|Tuomey]]]:** Juggles responsibilities, balls, and clubs - sometimes all at the same time. Celtic takeover now in progress. Frequently found lurking in IRC.

**[[[vincent-redgrave-s-author-page |Vincent_Redgrave]]]:** Vince is a graphic designer/marketing analyst in training and a fountain of nerd culture and useless general trivia. He's also an SCP wiki hype-man who helps run the [https://www.facebook.com/scpfoundation Official SCP Foundation Facebook Page] and wants you to go 'like' it this instant. Contact him if you need help with a story, with editing an image, or want to learn who 'Booster Gold' is or why Helvetica is literally the worst font.

**[[[wrongjohnsilver-s-author-page|WrongJohnSilver]]]:** WrongJohnSilver is known for his penchant for cufflinks and tie clips, providing patient, high-level draft critique, and the ability to be unfazed by any topic. He's the sort of person who can go from vacationing in a German spa town, to dodging the city watch and a zombie invasion on the streets of Prague within the week. Ask him about his extensive wine collection, or if you would like to rewrite an article.

Also known for complaining about Computers, Robots, and Other Things He Deals With On A Daily Basis. Most easily contacted on IRC and wikidot PMs. And before you ask, yes, I did put valuable time and energy into making this witty. Thanks for noticing.

**[[user Dankaar]]:** Another staffer who is mostly under the radar, the rarely spotted dankaar is Good With Critique.

**[[[Dr Bleeps Author Page| DrBleep]]]:** Most easily reached via IRC, or PM. Is a career Microbiologist, working towards graduate school, knowledgeable in most topics involving bacteria and viruses. Avid gamer, part of the Wikiwalk team. Staff member in other communities not involved with SCP. Sometimes on a full moon when they aren't running mad science, they are available to give critt.

**[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/fingo7-s-cute-stuff|Fingo7]]]:** Possible ladybug with a [http://www.scp-wiki.net/fingo7-s-art-i-guess-3 drawing tablet] and a green tea addiction that's somehow an active occultist, a decently-read Marxist, and an exotic millipede hobbyist all at once. Send him a Wikidot message or talk to him on IRC if you need (urgent) occult advice or just any kind of crit/brainstorming help. Secretly planning a site-wide takeover with his comrade, Lily.

**[[[jr-psych-chibis-personnel-file|ghostchibi]]]:** Also goes by Blake or Maxson on IRC, because why not be as confusing as godly possible. Answers asks on the serious official SCP tumblr blog, kicks down the door to #site19 to come scream about stuff, and loves Fallout so much, so so much, listen it's a GOOD SERIES you guys I'm TELLING YOU IT'S

**[[user Joreth]]:** People think Joreth is a wolf - but he's actually a dog wearing a wolf hat. Believed to be made staff in a failed attempt to curb shitposting. Does Internet Outreach because no one wants him on the site.

**[[user Mistbourne]]:** "The Man with the Red Pen", his grammarian tendencies tend to result in much nitpicking of the use of the English language.  Enjoys thunderstorms, mowing his lawn and gently correcting poor critique.

**[[user MrAnakinSpecter]]:** Master of ghosts and terrible jokes. Might one day finally one-up Tuomey, but it is unlikely.

**[[[wrong-analytics|MrWrong]]]:** Apparently the only staff member from Asia (specifically, Singapore) and alleged Japanophile (who //really// should try to venture out of articles based on Japanese cultural anecdotes). While he has written many articles, the ratings are admittedly not spectacular (SunnyClockwork attributes that to a lack of "plugging", so here's another avenue). Will be willing to look through drafts if asked to. Prefers to engage the site via a laptop. 

**[[user Shaggydredlocks]]:** Shaggy is currently helping with a ton of projects and initiatives for the wiki. He's a moderator on our reddit, as well as leading the charge on the User-Curated lists project.

**[[user subtletea]]:** The fastest pun in the west who would love to hear about your pets. Majors in wildlife bio. Is a bit of a homebody, and does not in fact have a wild life, unless you count seal rescue and horseshoe crab tagging. There's plenty of bio.  Come find them running the SCP dA or on the IRC chat! 

**[[user taylor_itkin]]:** Resident guitarist/singer, Operational Staff of the Forum Criticism Team, Community Outreach, Internet Outreach, and Chat Staff. Most easily reachable through IRC, but checks his wikidot inbox too. Sometimes does a podcast called [http://www.scp-wiki.net/author-s-corner-podcast-hub Author's Corner] that is sometimes pretty awesome. Likes dogs and also guitars and food. You look cute today <3

**[[[varaxous|Varaxous]]]:** The latest in a long line of staff with edgy names, they make site news, and with the power of two monitors, watches JoJo at the same time.
