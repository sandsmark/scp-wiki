title:Meet The Staff
[[div class="content-panel standalone series" style="background-color: #ffffeb;"]]

++ Senior Staff and You

These are the people who are assigned responsibilities on the site. It's their job to help keep the site running as smoothly and as well as possible. Most of them are veterans, with experience built up from the time spent here. Here's a small dossier to help show who the senior staff are. **If you have an issue for staff to address, please refer to the [[[Contact Staff]]] page.**

**Note:** You are expected to know who staff are when you encounter them "in the wild", because you have to know when to listen to them. You don't have to memorize or even thoroughly read these bios. But you do have to know which people are staff.

PS: Yes, these are tongue-in-cheek, but they're still true, so don't be surprised. We warned you.

++ Administrators

**[[[dr-bright-s-personnel-file |AdminBright]]]:** A.K.A. Dr. Bright or TheDuckMan. A self described "crotchety old man", so beware. He's blunt and crude, but always working for the best. Has been reliably active longer than any other present administrator. He is not now, nor has he ever been in recent memory, a monkey. 

**[[[dr-django-bridge-personnel-file |Dexanote]]]:** Canadian Pokemon Master. Good at brainstorming and expanding on ideas, not so great when it comes to rewrites and refining failed drafts. Excellent at grammar and phrasing. Possibly part hobbit. Has not, in fact, caught them all.

**[[[dr-manns-personnel-file |Dr. Mann]]]:** A pretty cool guy, and a great writer. He's got a very impressive creative mind, [[[One Bad Mother| though sometimes it's used for evil.]]] Good choice for asking military-related questions. Also runs the [http://wanderers-library.wikidot.com Wanderers Library].

**[[[dr-rogets-file|Roget]]]:** The lil' Stalin himself. Very active, and willing to help people out, if you send him a PM. Tries to answer every wikidot PM sent to him... eventually. Wrote the [http://www.scp-wiki.net/history-of-the-universe-hub History Of The SCP Foundation] essay series, so he's the best person to ask questions about site history.

**[[[doctor-s-s-personnel-file| SoullessSingularity]]]:** Quirky and bizarre --sometimes-- pretty much all the time, but mostly harmless. Soulless has an intense passion for horror, strong prose, and compelling fiction- and will be happy to help any drafts out in becoming these things! He'll gladly listen to unust about anyone's concerns and can be waved down on the chat or in Private Message. Go ahead and ask him what 'lmapo' means.

**[[[the-deadly-moose-personnel-file |TheDeadlyMoose]]]:** Kind of sassy, but has a good eye for what works. A good editor. Has a tendency to leave lots of criticism when de-lurked. Likes anthropology, psychology, gender, and sexuality. Non-binary-gender (usually 'they' or 'zie/zir' pronouns). Admin at the [http://wanderers-library.wikidot.com Wanderers Library]. Current [[[Chat Guide|chat owner of #site19]]] (now a ceremonial position!) and help chat ([http://05command.wikidot.com/chat #site17]). Permanently on Reserve.

**[[[researcher-zyn-s-personnel-file |Zyn]]]:** Psychology and social behavior major (formerly biology), [http://www.scp-wiki.net/into-that-good-night poetry enthusiast], part-time violin tutor, and butterfly caretaker (generally of //Nymphalis antiopa//, in the spring), Zyn is readily available for answering of questions in the IRC (send her a private message, or try #thecritters) and through wikidot PM. She can help if you want your articles to evoke non-scary emotions. Favors "Marp" as an onomatopoeia. Is kaiju butterfly ninja master on the weekends.

**[[[quikngruvn-personnel-file |Quikngruvn]]]:** Certified Old Fart™, now a Reserve Admin for the foreseeable future. Is vaguely aware that the wiki exists, and tends to disappear for months at a time, so is pretty much useless for critique or anything else (unless for some reason you're looking for trivia, sarcasm, and/or puns). Has started going by "dflatminor" in chat-- "a [[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_key|theoretical key]]] for a theoretical admin". (Feel free to berate him for his alleged cleverness.)

**[[[drclef-member-page |Clef]]]:** No.

++ Moderators

**[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/dr-arvind-desais-personnel-file |A Random Day]]]:** SCP Wiki in the streets, IRC chat in the sheets. Promoted to staff because people were too lazy to explain why he shouldn't be. Former editor of the SCP Site News, now captain of Community Outreach alongside his arch-nemesis [[user ProcyonLotor]]. Resident expert on clinical tone - he even wrote [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/clinical-tone-declassified |the guide on it]]].

**[[[accelerando-personnel-file|Accelerando]]]:** Resident tagger of articles and music --aficionado-- dilettante. His attention span keeps him away from chat, and usually drops in once every 3 months before zipping back into the void. Highly willing to discuss and brainstorm article ideas (or albums) through PMs.

**[[user ChaoSera]]:** Also answers to Chao, Sera and "that nerd in the corner". Can answer most Computer Science and Robotics related questions. Usually available in IRC and via PM. Has been made mod but nobody really knows why. Foul play is strongly suspected but witnesses keep mysteriously disappearing.

**[[[dr-magnus-personnel-file | DrMagnus]]]:** Most easily available via Wiki PM.  Current captain of the technical team, and Black Lion of the tech team voltron.  Teaches Historical Fencing, has three black belts, odd obsession with fountain pens + paper, and is in to tea.  Has been around the site //forever// and probably remembers whoever you're talking about.  Don't hesitate to reach out if there's a tech issue.

**[[[researcher-conwell-s-personnel-file|Jacob Conwell]]]:** Half man, half robot, and half coffee, Conwell came to the wiki to delete cold posts and write articles and tales of dubious quality. Perhaps it's for the best that the cold posts never seem to stop. As the moderator currently running the majority of deletions on the site, Conwell will likely delete something of yours at some point if it hits -10 votes. He’s usually in the chat and is happy to look at drafts of all kinds. He’s better used for developing ideas than for fixing grammar because words are hard.

**[[[leveritas-personnel-file|Leveritas]]]:** Currently the --despot-- moderator managing the [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/experiment-log-914 |experiment log for SCP-914]]] (don't PM him to ask if your entry will be good, makes him very cranky). This takes up most of his time on the Wiki, so make sure a draft or idea is well thought out before approaching him. Especially enjoys drafts with a strong sub-narrative. He's also fluent in Dutch, if you need that for some reason.

**[[[workers-of-the-world-unite |LilyFlower]]]:** When she's not organising a revolution or deleting copyrighted images, Lily can be messaged for help with biology (particularly zoology), socialism, queer stuff, and licensing. Always in #site19 and checks her wikidot PMs regularly. Ask her about her music tastes.

**[[[scp-mayday-j|Mayday]]]:** Mayday, also known as MayD, is almost always around and will try to respond to most IRC and wikidot messages. They have an almost encyclopedic knowledge on film, film history, and literature and about as much knowledge on site culture, history, and lore. They'll generally try to answer any question asked. 

**[http://www.scp-wiki.net/modern-erasmus-author-page Modern_Erasmus]:** More like Mod-ern Erasmus am I right? Erasmus tends to write about either deep historical mysteries or low quality puns. The Black Moon Howls with laughter at his dad jokes. Whether you need critique, licensing queries, social media moderation, or rewrites, Erasmus is your guy. 

**[[user ProcyonLotor]]:** is the only raccoon currently on staff, and thus the coolest one by default. He can appear grumpy at times, but in reality he's just a fan of whining and hyperbole. One of the chief licensing dorks, and always happy to answer questions about Creative Commons.

**[[[bluesoul|pxdnbluesoul]]]:** Professional IT by day, and actually professional IT by night as well. Operates several services including the scp.bz link shortener and S-CSS-P browser addon, and is an IRCOP and server administrator for SynIRC, our home. Runs a podcast and makes merch. Can answer questions about wiki formatting and usage, IRC, and most other technical aspects of the wiki universe.

**[[[Varaxous|varaxous]]]:** Despite their repeated claims to be "The Giant Rat who makes all of the rules," little evidence has been found to verify any of these claims. As far as anyone can tell, they're at most a normal sized rat with a cardboard crown. Further research is required. 

**[[[Dr. Adileh Khayyam's Personnel File|Taffeta]]]:** This is Taffeta. They've got your back. They could crit all your drafts in one paragraph. I would advise not getting downvoted by them -- their forum posts trap the threads of their victims.

**[[user taylor_itkin]]:** Resident guitarist and lead of the [http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-10752847/seminars-and-workshops#post-4193637 Seminars Project], easily reachable by Wikidot PM or on IRC. Easily bribed with sandwiches, cookies, or soup. Big fan of both Green Day and Pantera. Check me out on Spotify or iTunes I guess.

**[[user TSATPWTCOTTTADC]]:** Does work for the Internet Out[[# TSATPWTCOTTTADC]]reach staff team. Probably entirely hu[!--She knows.--]man, probably sleeps sometimes.

**[[[tuomey-author-page|Tuomey]]]:** Juggles responsibilities, balls, and clubs - sometimes all at the same time. Celtic takeover now in progress. Frequently found lurking in IRC.

**[[[uncle-nicolini-author-page|Uncle Nicolini]]]:** Possibly one of the more easy-going people on staff. On Community Outreach, Forum Crit, and Licensing. Also a moderator on the Spanish branch and currently runs the INT article rollout. 🤠Yee-haw, friends.🤠

**[[[wrongjohnsilver-s-author-page|WrongJohnSilver]]]:** WrongJohnSilver is known for his penchant for cufflinks and tie clips, providing patient, high-level draft critique, and the ability to be unfazed by any topic. He's the sort of person who can go from vacationing in a German spa town, to dodging the city watch and a zombie invasion on the streets of Prague within the week. Ask him about his extensive wine collection, or if you would like to rewrite an article.

++ Operational Staff

**[[user AbsentmindedNihilist]]:** Also known as Niles, she's a psychology major, aspiring screenwriter, and a worldbuilding and dialogue journeyman - her crit is best when it deals with character psychology, dialogue, mythology, or worldbuilding (what a surprise.) Best contacted via IRC, is also a member of chatstaff. Oh, and she's actually 5 corgis in a trenchcoat. Woof.

**[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/a-wild-alces-alces-is-plugging|Alces_alces]]]:** Local crazy horse person who only comes out of the barn for an occasional cup of coffee and forum critique. Most easily contacted via discord and wikidot pms.

**[[[captain-kirby-s-personal-file|Captain Kirby]]]:** Not as famous as the video game character, but appears in chat and on the forums more often. Also known for complaining about Computers, Robots, and Other Things He Deals With On A Daily Basis. Most easily contacted on IRC and wikidot PMs. And before you ask, yes, I did put valuable time and energy into making this witty. Thanks for noticing.

**[[[cone|Croquembouche]]]:** Knows things about CSS and ListPages. Changed the password to the coffee machine in the staff room and won't tell anyone what it is. Deals format screws in dark alleyways from trenchcoat pockets. The trenchcoat is also for sale.

**[[user Dankaar]]:** Another staffer who is mostly under the radar, the rarely spotted dankaar is Good With Critique.

**[[[Dr Bleeps Author Page| DrBleep]]]:** Most easily reached via IRC, or PM. Is a career Microbiologist, working towards graduate school, knowledgeable in most topics involving bacteria and viruses. Avid gamer, part of the Wikiwalk team. Staff member in other communities not involved with SCP. Sometimes on a full moon when they aren't running mad science, they are available to give critt.

**[[[elijah-martin-chevrolet-by-the-book|Elogee FishTruck]]]:** Also known as Jimmy Carter pretending to be Dwight D. Eisenhower pretending to be a Licensing aficionado. If you have questions about images and Creative Commons, ask him, he should know. Also part of various facets for Community Outreach, including seminars and introductions. A swell guy, in general, and stays up too late at night (he really should go to bed earlier).

**[[[fieldstone-ao-file|fieldstone]]]:** Gives mostly solid advice in forum crit and posts randomly in other places. Also works on site news. Will almost always respond to PMs... eventually. --Sometimes-- disappears suddenly from IRC for spouse/parent duty. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_behavior_support Mental health professional.] Cares a lot about making sure people feel welcome here, and about this whole thing in general.

**[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/fingo7-s-cute-stuff|Fingo7]]]:** Possible ladybug with a [http://www.scp-wiki.net/fingo7-s-art-i-guess-3 drawing tablet] and a green tea addiction that's somehow an active occultist, a decently-read Marxist, and an exotic millipede hobbyist all at once. Send him a Wikidot message or talk to him on IRC if you need (urgent) occult advice or just any kind of crit/brainstorming help. Secretly planning a site-wide takeover with his comrade, Lily.

**[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/gabriel-jade|Gabriel Jade]]]:** Friendly neighborhood hermit.  Eldritch binding magics may be used to compel this creature to provide critique on drafts.

**[[user Joreth]]:** People think Joreth is a wolf - but he's actually a dog wearing a wolf hat. Believed to be made staff in a failed attempt to curb shitposting. Does Internet Outreach because no one wants him on the site.

**[[user LadyKatie]]:** LadyKatie is our primary staff member for translation work on the wiki, as well as our primary contact for the INT Community and the translation sites. She also helps around the forums, giving crit and offering advice. She has an excellent cat named Pepper. 

**[[[personnel-file-lyusternik-lazar|Lazar]]]:** Draft critter. Idea critter. Possibly swamp critter. Can be found frequenting IRC and forums. Keeps a watchful eye on draft and idea forums to poach unsuspecting posts.

**[[[ManyMeats]]]:** An amalgamation of meats and also a pretty decent bowler.  Perhaps most infamous for the extreme amount of mana required to summon him, he is usually found dishing out Site Crit or pummeling the masses with knowledge in IRC.  Has a dog that is substantially cooler than he is, and who is also better at Site Crit.

**[[[Modulum]]]:** The crow perching atop the throne of r/SCPDeclassified. Manager/moderator of various social medias for Internet Outreach. Subsists on a diet of synthesizers and science fiction novels. Runs a wacky D&D campaign on the weekends. Up to try anything, really.

**[[user MrAnakinSpecter]]:** Master of ghosts and terrible jokes. Might one day finally one-up Tuomey, but it is unlikely.

**[http://www.scp-wiki.net/pedantique-personnel-file Pedantique]:** Reviews ideas. Critiques drafts. Once watched Dr. Strangelove and took all the wrong lessons from it. Old and grumpy, but not enough of either yet.

**[[[rtme-author|RockTeethMothEyes]]]:** Human, level 3 Cleric. Lawful Evil. Will only heal party in exchange for food later. Forum Criticism and Site Criticism staff. Will review your in-progress and posted works if you ask politely. Not ticklish.

**[http://www.scp-wiki.net/sly161-s-author-page Sly161]:** Sly is a forum critter, they help run one of the Tumblr blogs, a fan of horror, and is an up and coming forensic investigator. You can come to them if you need crit on a draft. You can find them in 17 or #thecritters, and they will always try to answer Wikidot PMs.

**[[user stormbreath]]:** Wikiwalk staffer, spends way too much time on this site. Site lore guru, has written for most GoIs. CSS hack, has made multiple themes. Can be contacted for crit and feedback if needed.

**[[user subtletea]]:** The fastest pun in the west who would love to hear about your pets. Majors in wildlife bio. Is a bit of a homebody, and does not in fact have a wild life, unless you count seal rescue and horseshoe crab tagging. There's plenty of bio.  Come find them running the SCP dA or on the IRC chat! 

**[[[themightymcb-s-author-page|TheMightyMcB]]]:** Also known simply as "McB", he's the resident headbanger, mediocre guitarist, and heavy metal vocalist on staff. Can often be found goofing off in the chat or on the front lines in the forums. There is a nonzero chance that he will initiate ritual combat with others possessing a "Mc-" name. Is quite possibly possessed.

**[[[UraniumEmpire]]]:** Resident indie trash cat. Contact her for crit, suggestions, writing help on pieces that tackle Judaism/Computers/Music/Anarcho-Syndicalism, and that cool bug pic you wanted to share with everyone.

**[[[the-file-of-an-acid-junkie-college-flunky-dirty-puppy-daddy |Zachary Maxwell]]]** is Acid Junkie College Flunky Dirty Puppy Daddy Bastard who will check your draft, fix your grammar, and link to useful stuff, when he's not selling lavender and wildflowers on Brighton beach.
