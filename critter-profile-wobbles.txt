In light of recent events, the operating staff at Wilson's have decided it may be for the best to keep information about Wobbles under wraps. If you do not have permission from myself, Alice, or Audrey, please hit that 'X' button at the top right of the screen and check out any of the other Critter Profiles. 

I'm being serious here folks if I catch you reading this without permission I will send you home early without pay. I don't want to do this, but believe me, I will.

Trusting in you,

'Wobbles' is our name for a Wobbegong we've come into custody of recently. You read that right, a Wobbegong! More specifically, he's a Spotted Wobbegong. If you don't know what a Wobbegong is, it's a type of carpet shark only found near Western Australia. That's right, Wobbles is an Australian shark. Now that's something you don't see everyday here in Oregon!

Being a type of carpet shark, Wobbles is excellent at hiding. He uses the carpet-like pattern on his back to blend into the ocean floor. He also uses the beard-like protrusions on his jaw to blend into plant life, making it harder for prey and predator to spot him. Sometimes even we can't find him in his Enclosure! As you might imagine, that makes it a little hard for Old Albert to keep an eye on him.

What makes Wobbles strange is that he's impossible to touch. I don't mean that he's just slippery or aggressive, it is literally impossible to touch his skin. No matter what we do, we can't grab, pet, or caress him. Anything that tries coming into contact with him seems to just bounce right off.  We're not exactly sure if he's fully in control of this ability, but one thing is clear; Wobbles does not like being touched!

We first found out about Wobbles after some folks over at Cannon Beach started making waves about a strange-looking critter making the rounds. They said something about how it would slip right through nets and almost repel touch.  There were also rumors about some shady folks trying to catch him and failing, so we set out to see if we could grab him and give Wobbles a proper home.

As you can probably tell, we succeeded! But I'll be darned if our little selachian friend didn't drive us nuts in the process. Gillnetting didn't work, lobster cages were too small for Wobbles, and longline fishing could potentially hurt other critters, so we didn't even bother trying that. Alex suggested we baited him with a magnetic object, then turned on a high-power magnet, but we don't have that kind of budget here.

Just as we were running out of ideas, Old Albert suggested we trap him in a tank, as it looked like he wasn't able to displace water. We quickly got to work and submerged the biggest tank we could get our hands on and loaded up with bait, then set up the lid to close at our command.. A few hours of patiently waiting and monitoring the camera feed, and presto! We were able to capture our new friend and bring him back home. 

Wobbles made sure to let us know he didn't like anyone closing their hands near him, as the poor little guy would swim away the moment we shut our hands, even to grab some chum for him. He's gotten more trusting around people recently, especially Old Albert, whose arthritis won't let him close his hands all the way. A match made in heaven! Despite having made a friend, Wobbles is still pretty elusive. It seems like our sneaky friend highly values his privacy, which is something we can respect.

Wobbles shares his enclosure with a few other animals; namely a pair of dolphins, some harbor seals, and an octopus. He doesn't need much, but we did add some hiding places for him since he seems to be wary of everything and everyone for the moment. Every once in a while we'll have to change around the locations of the hiding places as he'll only use them each a few times. It looks like he can be a little picky.

**EDIT:** //After the unfortunate incident on 06/21/2002, we've had to start vetting our volunteers. It's really putting a strain on the old checkbook and slowing things down a tick, but it's worth it to make sure the critters at this here Center are safe and sound!//

Though we were originally a little anxious about introducing some other aquatic life into Wobbles' enclosure, we quickly realized that it was not a big deal. Even if those seals or the octopus wanted to make a meal out of him, they'd have to try catching him first, which is one tall order!

**SITUATION REPORT:** On 06/19/2002, we accepted a volunteer form from a guy no one had seen around Boring before, but he claimed to be very experienced with sharks. We gave him a ring and asked him to come by on the twenty-second. When he showed up for his first day of volunteer work, he ran straight for Marine Enclosure 1 while yelling "TASTE MY FIST, YOU SELACHIAN WRETCH! FOR THE SHARK PUNCHING CENTER!"

Fortunately, Old Albert and I sprung into action. We tackled down the perpetrator with some good ol' WSW (Wilson's Stranger Wrangling, or 'Strangling' for short.) and saved the day just as he was about to dive in for poor Wobbles! He might have been an expert in selachian pugilism, but clearly not versed in homo sapien engagement. We handed him over to the Supervisors, who seemed just as confused as we were about the odd fellow, but they seemed pretty interested to learn more about his fellow shark punching lunatics. 

Anyway, it looks like we can no longer trust people like we used to. Alice suggested we invest in some background checks for volunteers, but I'm gonna have to run the numbers by Ted and see what we can put together. In the meantime, Audrey is going to password protect this Critter Profile. I don't know if those shark punching creeps are still out there, but if for some reason they're reading this; this is Wilson's Wildlife Solutions where all critters are welcome, not Wilson's Selachian Wrestling!
