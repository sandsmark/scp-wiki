**Item #:** SCP-1203

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:**  SCP-1203 is assigned to a standard Euclid living space at Site 10. There is to be one guard on duty at all times near the cell, to ensure 1203 does not attempt a self-termination or auto-abort. It is recommended the subject be dosed persistently with the prescribed anti-psychotic medicines and mild narcotics to avoid this possibility. SCP-1203 is to be restrained at times when not under supervision. At no time is SCP-1203 allowed to leave Site 10. 

Some hours before death (1-3) SCP-1203 will begin seizing, what follows is a state similar to catatonia; time of death is recorded after a pulse is shown in the newborn, rather than the mother’s natural death.

**Description:**  SCP-1203 is a human female, approximately 20 years of age and identifies by the name ‘Miranda’. The subject has been in containment for approximately 95 years, or 5 cycles as of the subject’s next natural death and birth. 

SCP-1203 was recovered from Xochicalco, Mexico. Agent ██████ began investigation with a lead based on local reports of disappearances near the Feathered Serpent pyramid (reference ██-████ in the ██████ newspaper, "La Policía Salvar Bebé Enpirámide"). SCP-1203 was discovered near the pyramid summit accompanied by members of [DATA EXPUNGED]. The “mother” died in labor, the newborn SCP-1203 surviving post-mortem.

At 19 years of age SCP-1203 undergoes what is now being classified as time induced parthenogenesis, resulting with the conception of one genetically identical human fetus. At an embryonic level this form of reproduction is comparable to the aforementioned medical phenomenon, however, new instances of SCP-1203 are not developmentally inhibited, and do not benefit from any (natural) extended longevity.

SCP-1203 during any stage of her life has an identical biological profile to previous instances of SCP-1203. A definite date cannot be placed on the length of the existence of SCP-1203.

The condition suffered by SCP-1203 is unique in that memories are also transferred from the mother to the newborn. Variances in the progeny of SCP-1203 are represented in the sense that SCP-1203 maintains memory of previous occurrences. This experience of “rebirth” and the recollection of the event have a noticeable and detrimental psychological effect on the subject. Based on these observations we can assume SCP-1203 is lucid in infancy and during birth.

**Log from Failed Termination-1203b:**

Foreword: Due to lack of any discernible benefit to the Foundation and the current mental state of SCP-1203, a termination was scheduled on █/██/██ under supervision from the late Research Assistant █████. The attempt to abort cyclical rebirth of the subject took place shortly after SCP-1203s ‘first’ labor contractions. The decision to abort rather than terminate SCP-1203 was reached on basis that more could be learned in regard to the nature of SCP-1203 in this manner.

Extraction was performed successfully. [REDACTED] having been completely removed and separated from the mother. During the cranial potassium injection the mother as well as the fetal husk began to [DATA EXPUNGED]. What followed was a reportedly indiscernible explosion of viscera (due to the viscera) . Research Assistant █████ was found afterwards completely drained of fluid, his circulatory system inverted and strewn from the mouth.  

The newborn recovered completely after feeding in this manner.
