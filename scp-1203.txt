**Item #:** SCP-1203

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:**  SCP-1203 is assigned to a 3m x 2m x 2m containment cell. The living space at Site 10 is outfitted with steel  walls and one solid barred door that locks from the outside. There is to be one guard on duty at all times near the cell, to ensure SCP-1203 does not attempt a self-termination or auto-abort. It is recommended the subject be dosed persistently with the prescribed anti-psychotic medicines and mild narcotics to avoid this possibility. These medicines will be replaced with restraints during SCP-1203s pregnancies. SCP-1203 is to be restrained at times when not under supervision. At no time is SCP-1203 allowed to leave Site 10. 

Some hours before death (1-3) SCP-1203 will begin seizing, what follows is a state similar to catatonia; time of death is recorded after a pulse is shown in the newborn, rather than the mother’s natural death.

Termination attempts on SCP-1203 as of the incident with Research Assistant █████ are indefinitely on hold. Reference Log from Failed Termination-1203b. 

**Description:**  SCP-1203 is a human female, approximately 20 years of age and identifies by the name ‘Miranda’. The subject has been in containment for approximately 95 years, or 5 cycles as of the subject’s next natural death and birth. 

SCP-1203 was recovered from Xochicalco, Mexico. Agent ██████ began investigation with a lead based on local reports of disappearances near the Feathered Serpent pyramid (reference ██-████ in the ██████ newspaper, "La Policía Rescata a Bebé en Pirámide"). SCP-1203 was discovered near the pyramid summit accompanied by members of The Serpent's Hand. The “mother” died in labor, the newborn SCP-1203 surviving post-mortem.

At 19 years of age SCP-1203 undergoes a process similar to parthenogenesis, resulting with the conception of one genetically identical human fetus. At an embryonic level this form of reproduction is comparable to the aforementioned medical phenomenon, however, new instances of SCP-1203 are not developmentally inhibited, and do not benefit from any (natural) extended longevity.

SCP-1203 during any stage of her life has an identical biological profile to previous instances of SCP-1203. A definite date cannot be placed on the length of the existence of SCP-1203.

The condition suffered by SCP-1203 is unique in that memories are also transferred from the mother to the newborn. Variances in the progeny of SCP-1203 are represented in the sense that SCP-1203 maintains memory of previous occurrences. This experience of “rebirth” and the recollection of the event have a noticeable and detrimental psychological effect on the subject. Based on these observations we can assume SCP-1203 is lucid in infancy and during birth.

**Documentation:** Excerpt  from Interview
Translated Revision

>  **Dr. ███████:** Tell us more about your family history.
>  
>  **SCP-1203:** I only remember back to my eighth grandmother, but only little bits and pieces. I recall other things but they’re kind of like a dream that you forget after you wake up.
>  
>  **Dr. ███████:** Tell us the experience you have before death.
>  
>  **SCP-1203-:** I fall asleep and I wake up. It’s dark, and then I feel warm. I see a light like a tunnel, and I'm back again. 
>  
>  **Dr. ███████:** How is the experience of being born traumatic?
> 
>  **SCP-1203:** I trust you do not mean the last time. I can still hear that poor man screaming.

>  **Dr. ███████:** No.

> **SCP-1203:** I remember it. I'm there in both places, and I'm pushing myself out... It is unpleasant.

> 
> **SCP-1203:** Yes, and I would like to fly as well.

**Log from Failed Termination-1203b:**

Foreword: Due to lack of any discernible benefit to the Foundation and the current mental state of SCP-1203, a termination was scheduled on █/██/██ under supervision from the late Research Assistant █████. The attempt to abort cyclical rebirth of the subject took place shortly after SCP-1203s ‘first’ labor contractions. The decision to abort rather than terminate SCP-1203 was reached on basis that more could be learned in regard to the nature of SCP-1203 in this manner.

Extraction was performed successfully, the newborn having been completely removed and separated from the mother. The mother was then pronounced dead. During the cranial potassium injection the mother as well as the child's (SCP-1203s) husk began to [DATA EXPUNGED]. What followed was a reportedly indiscernible eruption of viscera from Research Assistant █████. Both instances of SCP-1203 were found afterwards to be undamaged.

The newborn recovered completely after the incident. No abnormal potassium levels were present.

Research Assistant █████ was found afterwards completely drained of fluid, his circulatory system inverted and strewn from the mouth. The autopsy revealed no marks on Research Assistant █████ that would be indicative of a physical assault. No other anomalies were found save extra hair growth of 300mm.

**Addendum 1203-1:** Note found near the pyramid shortly after containment of SCP-1203.

> Dear Sirs of the Foundation
> 
> Your ignorance was shown like a dark veil o'er Xochicalco before your pawns arrived on the summit of The Feathered Serpent. Our hands cradled Miranda in the pains of her eternal birth, and lo, your Agent stood before her in the twilight like one empty specter made anxious by death's arrival. In the chaos what manner of blood was spilt on the Angel? What could we do but stand aside and mourn The Ouroboros as it was snatched from our warm hands, what could we do with your righteous heel pressing ever so absently on the Serpent's head?
