**Item #:** SCP-4348

**Object Class:** --Safe-- Neutralized

**Special Containment Procedures:** The building containing SCP-4348 has been acquired by Foundation assets. All entrances into SCP-4348 are to be padlocked, and a sign stating "WE'RE CLOSED" is to be hung on the front door. --These containment procedures have proven effective due to SCP-4348's benign nature, therefore no further containment measures are to be put into place.-- 

Following the neutralization of SCP-4348, these containment procedures are to continue to prevent unauthorized access. Personnel with Level 4/4348 clearance may request access to the interior of SCP-4348.

**Description (Obsolete):** SCP-4348 is a building located in Monroe, Louisiana. Signage indicates that SCP-4348 is named "dado borger and france fry," created by "dado."[[footnote]]"dado" is a Person of Interest responsible for creating several anomalous pharmaceutical products and anomalous businesses. For more information, consult [[[dado-hub|Document DADO/74]]].[[/footnote]] All municipal records indicate that SCP-4348 is a non-anomalous Burger King owned by one "dado c. dado".

The interior of SCP-4348 is atypical for a restaurant of its kind. There is no furniture save for a counter to order at, and the floor, walls, and ceiling are all rainbow-colored. There is a menu mounted on the back wall, although the only item is "dado borger" listed enough times to cover the entire menu.

A microphone and speaker on the counter allows patrons to communicate with an entity, presumably dado, in order to ask for a "dado borger." Once the patron puts 2.99 USD or equivalent[[footnote]]Accepted currency includes most forms of legal tender, precious metals, and other "dado" products.[[/footnote]] onto the counter, the currency will disappear and be replaced with a receipt for a "dado burger," alongside change.

72 hours prior to their visit to SCP-4348, the patron will inevitably encounter SCP-4348-1. SCP-4348-1 is a medium-rare cheeseburger with toppings of lettuce, tomato, cheese made from goat milk, mustard, and a wheat-based bun, often with a side of french fries[[footnote]]Members of Mobile Task Force Lambda-14 ("[[[SCP-4554|One Star Reviewers]]]") that tasted SCP-4348-1 report that it is an "above-average burger, but with an odd choice of toppings."[[/footnote]]. The words "dado burger" are burned into the top of SCP-4348-1's patty. Modes of encountering SCP-4348-1 vary from person to person, but common scenarios include:

* Finding SCP-4348-1 in their ovens, microwaves, or air conditioning units at home or at their place of work.
* Discovering SCP-4348-1 in a dumpster or other trash storage unit.
* Having a friend or relative offer them SCP-4348-1 free of charge.
* Opening food packaging in order to eat another type of food, but instead finding SCP-4348-1 wrapped inside of the packaging.

The secondary anomalous property of SCP-4348-1 manifests when the subject that ordered it either comes within 10 meters of it, or makes visual contact. The patty of SCP-4348-1 will instantly accelerate to a speed between 15 and 70 kilometers per hour, in the direction of the subject's mouth. In several instances, SCP-4348-1 has caused choking, concussions, or damage to the lower skull.

The subject will inevitably visit SCP-4348 within 72 hours of receiving SCP-4348-1. Even subjects who are deceased will visit SCP-4348; this is often the result of incorrect instructions given to ambulance drivers.

In addition, there is a series of gas pumps built near SCP-4348 labeled as "vroom juice by dado" that is a non-anomalous gas station.

**Additional Notes:** Initial activity from SCP-4348 was suspected after the following was recorded in an advertisement hosted on AdSense’s advertisement database:

A member of D-Class personnel, D-34832, was deployed into SCP-4348 with a small amount of money to ascertain its anomalous properties.

Earlier that day, D-34832 reported a patty originating from the automated food delivery system colliding suddenly with his face, causing a headache. The instance of SCP-4348-1 was traced back to Culinary Specialist Sam, who asserted that they had received a special order from O5-3 to make the burger for D-34832. Investigation of Mr. Sam's terminal revealed this email to be an obvious forgery, and Mr. Sam was reprimanded for this incident.

Because of this incident, D-34832 was originally selected for testing with SCP-4348.

|| **Neutralization** ||

SCP-4348 was declared Neutralized in the wake of Incident DADO/FINAL, as all of its anomalous properties has ceased. See the updated Description for up-to-date documentation of SCP-4348's current state.

> Five minutes after the conclusion of this call, all anomalous artifacts associated with dado suddenly lost their anomalous properties. For example, all pharmaceutical artifacts did not function as they did previously, and mostly consisted of sugar pills, and [[[SCP-888-EX]]]'s signage and advertising suddenly changed "dado laundry and tan" to "Dad's Laundry and Tanning Services."

**Description (Updated):** SCP-4348 is a dilapidated Burger King restaurant and Shell gas station, located in Monroe, Louisiana. The interior of SCP-4348 is consistent with Burger King franchise restaurants built in 2003. No municipal records of SCP-4348 prior to Incident DADO/FINAL can be located.

SCP-4348 used to be a restaurant named "dado borger and france fry," and had the anomalous property of being able to spontaneously manifest cheeseburgers. However, these anomalous properties have ceased following Incident DADO/FINAL.

**Additional Notes:** A basement has been discovered underneath SCP-4348, containing several items and documents of note. Personnel with Level 4/4348 clearance may consult Document SCP-4348-Recovered Materials for more information.

|| **Recovered Materials** ||

During an investigation of SCP-4348, Agent Bruno noticed that one of the booth chairs could be moved aside to reveal a staircase into a previously undiscovered basement room, apparently functioning as an air-conditioned warehouse. The contents of the basement were as follows:

* A total of 80 wooden crates, containing raw hamburger patties, lettuce, goat cheese blocks, tomatoes, and wheat buns.
* Three gas stoves, showing signs of consistent use.
* Seven skillets, showing signs of consistent use.
* Several mirrors of varying size and model. All but one were shattered.
* A microphone headset with an AA battery in it. Brand could not be identified.
* A rolled up poster, advertising "[[[SCP-3802|hare club for kids by dado]]]".
* A computer attached to a monitor. The monitor constantly displayed a green progress bar, continuously displaying 0%. Computer OS identified as Windows XP.
* An instance of SCP-███. Object was found lying on the ground with a bright red hue. When touched by Agent Bruno, object assumed a violet hue.
* A Glock-20 pistol, showing signs of use.
* A safe. Locksmith identified combination as "1968". A notebook was found inside.

In addition, personnel have reported that the interior of the basement to have the smell of hamburgers and Freon.
