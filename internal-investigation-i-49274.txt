Worker Repairman Kanako Izumi inspected the carcass of Lesser Foreman Masanori Amakusa to report cause of death. Findings verify that cause of death is indeed murder:

> The murder victim's neck was broken using a rope around his neck, dangling from the ceiling of his personal quarters. Only his fingerprints are present on the rope. A tipped-off stool rests below the murder victim's position.
> 
> Yes, this has to be a murder. 
> 
> - Worker Repairman Kanako Izumi

Due to the relatively high profile of the murder, the regional manager of the Western Kyushu region, Regional Manager Shichiro Ginma, [[footnote]] Worker ID: RMAN94728520 [[/footnote]] has dispatched Internal Investigator James Loope to identify the murderer. Internal Investigator James Loope added his opinion on the murder:

> I agree that Amakusa's death is murder. The Factory has many rivals, seeking to liquidate this lovely Factory like old Supes burning some poor soul's noggin with his laser eyes. This murder is a clear attempt to ruin the Factory's good work in Western Kyushu. I'll not let this trickery snowball into another October of '29.

Security Officer Romi Kim was highly cooperative, and has provided a lead regarding the murder. 

[[footnote]] 
@@@@
> It was a routine check, that I'm mandated to perform when an employee is not present at his workstation one minute following the designated time. In fact, I have been visiting Lesser Foreman Amakusa's quarters for the past week or so. He seems to be looking out at the window all the time. Can't imagine why. The Factory is a wonderful workplace. Better than those damned Japanese companies. Definitely.

Chaos Insurgency Employee Taro Yamada formally apologised to all Factory workers in Western Kyushu Power Station for his disruption of their much-valued labour.

He also donated all of his assets to the Factory as compensation. After which, Yamada willingly entered the Central Furnace in order to have his raw materials processed to fuel the Central Furnace. Employees have commented on Yamada's declaration.

[[footnote]] 
@@@@
> I wish we have kept him around as a fellow employee instead, but I suppose he needs judgment in this specific case. At least he is willing to contribute to the Factory, despite the slight errors he made. Only the Factory will regard its saboteurs as usable resources.
