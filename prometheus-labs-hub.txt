[[tab Overview]]

> Prometheus was no god.
> 
> That's something that many people forget or do not understand. He was neither a god nor a man, but made of older stuff. He was a titan.
> 
> When Gaia and Uranos mated, they made many children. The hecationaries, the cyclopses, and a dozen other monsters that roamed the earth. Each one, Uranos imprisoned back inside Gaia, all of them, until she bore the titans, whom he was pleased to look upon.
> 
> Mind you, his son Saturn later castrated him and usurped him at Gaea's urging, but this was the way of things for the Greeks.
> 
> When Zeus later rose up against the titans and their cruel rein, only a handful of the titans fought with the gods. Themis and Prometheus. And the gods were later successful.
> 
> It would be foolish to claim that Prometheus was the sole originator of their victory, and I will not do so, though many of the ancient authors did. Prometheus fought, after all, for selfish reasons.
> 
> Men.
> 
> Prometheus granted writing, science, farming, medicine, and math to the humans, his children. The gods granted suffering and demanded sacrifices. When did Prometheus ever ask for a burnt carcass in his honor?
> 
> Men were one of his creations, you see. He wanted them kept safe and strong and viable. He wanted them to be blessed by the gods and looked after. Zeus was angered when he stole fire, and he chained him to a rock to have his liver eaten by an eagle each day.
> 
> Just as Prometheus stole fire from the gods, so too do we wrest the secrets from the universe daily. How mystical and magical must fire have been at one time. How dangerous and unbelievable. Could you imagine if the only source for something, the only thing you could relate it to, was a star?
> 
> How unbelievable it must have been to the ancient Greeks. And now? A trivial thing. A trivial thing once deified.
> 
> Such is the way of all great magics. Such is way of all great works. Such is the way of all unknown things.
> 
> With study and intuition, the mystical becomes common. No sacrifices are needed, and no blood is given. The doors of the universe are opening to us ever further.
> 
> Let us step through.

> //— From the Prometheus Labs Hiring Packet, circa 1982, written by [REDACTED]//



Prometheus Labs, Incorporated was a private, for-profit conglomerate that was based around scientific research and development. Founded in 1892, the company focused exclusively on researching and developing anomalous technology for commercial and private sale. Prior to the events of [DATA EXPUNGED] in 1998, Prometheus Labs was considered to be one of the most prolific competitors of the Foundation. It had a large public profile as a purveyor of high-quality electronic, medical and pharmaceutical, automotive, optical, and industrial goods produced from anomalous research. Prometheus Labs also had classified contracts from various worldwide militaries, primarily the United States. It developed numerous specialized technologies for these groups, aimed at enhancing their military capabilities, such as [REDACTED].

 Prometheus Labs was affiliated with most of the major Groups of Interest, having engaged in lawsuits with Wondertainment Industries, purchased objects from Marshall, Carter, and Dark, worked with the Church of Maxwellist Writ to develop brain-machine interfaces, designed low-cost food alternatives for Manna Charitable Foundation, sold tools and supplies to Are We Cool Yet?, the Global Occult Coalition, and the Chaos Insurgency, and waged industrial espionage against GRU Division "P". Prometheus Labs was neither openly antagonistic nor helpful to the Foundation. The Foundation offered to design custom containment protocols for Prometheus Labs' more volatile objects, but were declined. 

Following [DATA EXPUNGED] and the resulting coverup, many of the projects in development were seized by the Foundation, and surviving personnel taken into the Foundation's employment. It is believed that other Groups of Interest also stole projects and research from other facilities. Prometheus Labs had numerous networks, branches, and affiliates and offices around the world. Although all of these locations had generalized work, they were primarily dedicated to individual specialized fields of research. For instance, the Prometheus Labs branch in Kolkata focused on optical research with lasers, while the New Mexico facility was dedicated to computer sciences. Certain documents indicate that Prometheus Labs also had more esoteric facilities, such as a fully self-sustained facility on Mars which studied nuclear physics and quantum mechanics, and a laboratory in the Marianas Trench that researched planetary engineering (these facilities have yet to be located). In addition, [REDACTED] indicates that Prometheus Labs was at least in the logistical organization stage of constructing a facility in the Jurassic period. It is unclear whether or not this facility was successfully constructed.

[[tab Prometheus Labs Format]]
Prometheus Labs is first and foremost a research and development corporation. There are many problems that we are working to solve, but as a for-profit company, there are limited funds available to solve them. Therefore, Prometheus Labs must prioritize funding for those projects and research that we feel deserve it. 
 However, we pride ourselves on the independent research performed by our world-class scientists. Products such as the mental web and teleportation were developed by researchers working on their vacation days. For this reason, Prometheus Labs has instituted a policy of independent research for eight hours per week. We have also provided this proposal request form. In the event that you wish to pursue an independent avenue of study full-time, please fill out this form and submit it to Human Resources. Please allow two to four days for processing.
 
**GRANT REQUEST FOR [INSERT PROJECT HERE]**
Do not give your project a special name. Name it based on what it is: a grant request for a scientific question.

**PROBLEM**
What are you trying to achieve? What problem are you trying to solve?
Explain the issue in great detail. Make it clear why this is a problem that Prometheus Labs should work on.

**SOLUTION**
Explain the proposed technology solution. How exactly does it work? What does it do to solve the problem? What is the technology and/or the research behind the proposal that supports its viability? What are the benefits of the technology and/or research?  Bibliographies recommended.

**BUSINESS CASE**
Who will purchase or use this product or knowledge? Give demographics (age group, ethnicity, economic class, etc. ). List potential markets. If it is a product, what makes this product different from similar products already on the market? What makes it a more appealing choice? How will the use and/or sale of this research and/or technology benefit Prometheus Labs or scientific knowledge?

**USE OF FUNDING**
You are asking for funding to support development and research of this concept. What will the funds go into? What will they be used for? What will the funds purchase? Who will they hire? Give a timetable for expected lengths of work and dates of completion, a list of materials and tools to be used for the project, a list of necessary contractors, and the price ranges for all. 

**KNOWN ISSUES**
What are the major stumbling blocks to the adoption, widespread use, and/or profitability of this research and/or technology? Known bugs, difficulties in bringing to market, project failures, etc. How can these issues be fixed?

 This is a very heavily watered-down format of actual grant proposals and various engineering competitions I've entered. Prometheus Labs is a company with limited funds. Therefore, it must select only the best and most well-thought-out projects to fund. The problem and solution are self-evident. The business case is basically justifying the creation of the object and whether or not there is a plan to make it work. The use of funding is to make sure that the money poured into the project actually goes to good use. The known issues are a pragmatic way to make sure that this product actually has a future, and that its creator is thinking ahead.

You don't need a bibliography, but it would definitely enhance it.
This format is basically another perspective on SCP objects that Prometheus Labs made. They were designed with a commercial purpose in mind. What was that purpose? What was it intended for? Who was it intended for?
 The format is basically asking you "why would this object be created in the first place?"
It may be more difficult to use this to create a story than you are used to, but it also offers a unique perspective on an SCP: that of its creator.

There is only one thing that needs to be kept in mind when using this format: the road to hell is paved with good intentions.

(Prometheus Labs builds things they think are useful but have horrific consequences)
