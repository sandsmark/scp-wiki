Aeons ago, the Titan Prometheus stole fire from the gods and gave it to humanity, elevating them to a higher plane. He was punished for his impudence by Zeus. Yet his sacrifice freed humanity to look to the stars, and beyond. Prometheus Labs dedicates itself to developing technology and tools that will aid humanity to surmount the so-far extrinsic realm of the paranormal. Every day, we wonder to ourselves "What could be?" But instead of being content with what is, Prometheus Labs continually redefines the status quo, pushing ourselves to advance our knowledge of the universe and put that knowledge to use. One thousand years ago, it was believed that the universe revolved around the Earth. The revelation that the Earth revolved around the Sun fundamentally changed the way humanity viewed its place in the Universe. Prometheus Labs continually makes innovations and discoveries that make changes equally groundbreaking. We innovate, we dream, we strive, and we succeed. Here at Prometheus Labs, our motto is "There is nothing man was not meant to know."

Prometheus Labs, Incorporated is a private, for-profit corporation that focuses on scientific research and development. It lacks a central location; instead, there are multiple facilities and offices throughout the world. Although all of these locations have generalized work, they are primarily dedicated to individual specialized fields of research. For instance, the Prometheus Labs branch in Kolkata is focused on optical research with lasers, while the New Mexico facility is dedicated to computer sciences, and the Martian facility is focused primarily on nuclear physics and quantum mechanics, whereas the sub-Atlantic facility is dedicated to planetary engineering. Prometheus Labs also has numerous affiliates and branches with various other specialties. The company is focused on groundbreaking research and innovation in all manner of disciplines, such as theoretical physics, civil engineering, pure and applied mathematics, molecular gastronomy, zoology, xenobiology, nanorobotics, and more, with enormous implications for humanity and humanity's existence. Prometheus Labs is always looking for candidates with masters and doctoral degrees in all sciences. It offers numerous perks, such as personal healthcare from its world-class physicians, private living space, multiple vacation days, excellent food from a world-class cafeteria, and starting salaries in excess of $200,000 per year.
