[[tab Overview]]

Prometheus Labs, Incorporated was a private, for-profit conglomerate that was based around scientific research and development. Founded in 1892, the company focused exclusively on researching and developing anomalous technology for commercial and private sale. Prior to the events of [DATA EXPUNGED] in 1998, Prometheus Labs was considered to be one of the most prolific competitors of the Foundation. It had a large public profile as a purveyor of high-quality electronic, medical and pharmaceutical, automotive, optical, and industrial goods produced from anomalous research. Prometheus Labs also had classified contracts from various worldwide militaries, primarily the United States. It developed numerous specialized technologies for these groups, aimed at enhancing their military capabilities, such as [REDACTED].

 Prometheus Labs was affiliated with most of the major Groups of Interest, having engaged in lawsuits with Wondertainment Industries, purchased objects from Marshall, Carter, and Dark, worked with the Church of Maxwellist Writ to develop brain-machine interfaces, designed low-cost food alternatives for Manna Charitable Foundation, sold tools and supplies to Are We Cool Yet?, the Global Occult Coalition, and the Chaos Insurgency, and waged industrial espionage against GRU Division "P". Prometheus Labs was neither openly antagonistic nor helpful to the Foundation. The Foundation offered to design custom containment protocols for Prometheus Labs' more volatile objects, but were declined. 

Following [DATA EXPUNGED] and the resulting coverup, many of the projects in development were seized by the Foundation, and surviving personnel taken into the Foundation's employment. It is believed that other Groups of Interest also stole projects and research from other facilities. Prometheus Labs had numerous networks, branches, and affiliates and offices around the world. Although all of these locations had generalized work, they were primarily dedicated to individual specialized fields of research. For instance, the Prometheus Labs branch in Kolkata focused on optical research with lasers, while the New Mexico facility was dedicated to computer sciences. Certain documents indicate that Prometheus Labs also had more esoteric facilities, such as a fully self-sustained facility on Mars which studied nuclear physics and quantum mechanics, and a laboratory in the Marianas Trench that researched planetary engineering. These facilities have yet to be located. In addition, [REDACTED] indicates that Prometheus Labs was making plans to construct a facility in the Jurassic period. It is unclear whether or not this facility was successfully constructed. 
 
On [REDACTED], commercials for employment at Prometheus Labs were discovered broadcasting on various media, such as magazines, radio, and television. Although these commercials were immediately removed from circulation, the source of the commercials has yet to be located, and further commercials periodically appear. Attached is a transcript of a commercial that broadcasted during [REDACTED].

> //Begins in a laboratory. An unidentified woman in a lab coat is looking through a microscope. She looks up at the camera and begins narrating.//
> 
> Aeons ago, the Titan Prometheus stole fire from the gods and gave it to humanity. He was punished for his impudence by Zeus.
> 
> //As the narration proceeds, the scene cuts to a picture of the Titan giving fire to humans, and being chained to a rock.//
> 
> Yet his sacrifice elevated humanity to a higher plane. No longer was fire a mysterious and paranormal object; it was now a tool that benefited humanity and let them become masters of the planet.
> 
> //The scene cuts to a savannah at night, where prehistoric// Homo sapiens //begin to use fire. The scene zooms out to reveal the solar system, and then zooms into the moon, where an astronaut steps from a lunar lander and plants an American flag. The scene then zooms out and back into the Earth, into a laboratory.// 
> 
>  In the same spirit, Prometheus Labs dedicates itself to developing technology and tools that will aid humanity to surmount the so-far extrinsic realm of the paranormal.  One thousand years ago, it was believed that the universe revolved around the Earth. The revelation that the Earth revolved around the Sun fundamentally changed the way humanity viewed its place in the Universe.
> 
> //As the above passage is narrated, the scene begins in a candlelit stone room, where a man looks through a telescope. He is immediately pulled from his telescope and the scene switches so that the man is tied to a stake. Suddenly, the man is released from the stake.//
> 
>  Every day, we wonder to ourselves "What could be?" But instead of being content with what is, Prometheus Labs continually redefines the status quo, pushing ourselves to advance our knowledge of the universe and put that knowledge to use. 
> 
> //The scene switches to an empty laboratory. Scientists enter the laboratory, looking at and drawing on whiteboards, welding objects, writing notes, observing [DATA EXPUNGED], performing tests, soldering wires, flipping switches, and other actions.//
> 
> Every day, Prometheus Labs makes innovations and discoveries that are equally groundbreaking. We innovate, we dream, we strive, and we succeed. Here at Prometheus Labs, our motto is "There is nothing man was not meant to know."
> 
> //The scene returns to the woman from before. Behind her, a dinosaur tentatively identified as a// Brachiosaurus //lows, before exiting the scene.// 
> 
> Prometheus Labs is focused on groundbreaking research and innovation in all manner of disciplines, such as theoretical physics, civil engineering, pure and applied mathematics, molecular gastronomy, zoology, xenobiology, nanorobotics, and more, with enormous implications for humanity and humanity's existence.
> 
> //The scene rapidly changes, displaying artistic renders of atoms, nanobots, mathematical equations, foodstuffs, and alien lifeforms alongside terrestrial life.//
> 
>  Prometheus Labs is always looking for candidates with masters and doctoral degrees in all sciences. We offer numerous perks, such as personal healthcare from its world-class physicians, private living space, multiple vacation days, excellent food from the world's finest molecular gastronomists, a chance to fundamentally change the world or even the universe, and starting salaries in excess of $125,000 per year. If you are interested in working for Prometheus Labs, please call us at [DATA EXPUNGED] or visit "www.prometheuslabs.com" for more information.

> //As the above passage is narrated, the scene cuts to a laboratory where numerous scientists are working. The scene rapidly zooms out, to a jungle where what appear to be dinosaurs are converging on the laboratory, to the planet Earth, to the solar system, and then to the Milky Way galaxy. The Prometheus Labs logo appears, as well as the name of the website and the phone number.//

//A note from A Random Day://
//So. These are my GOI entries. They all use a single object, but further than that, all of these entries are based around reading in between the lines. You can read them for what they are and enjoy them, but by paying more attention to the story and thinking about what is being said will give you a deeper appreciation for the world they are set in and enrich your experience reading them. There are many little hints, clues, and tiny Easter eggs to deepen the world.//
//My work is inspired heavily by the Half-Life universe, both for its science-fiction universe and the way things can go so easily wrong. Like Half-Life, I tend to avoid direct exposition, instead advancing the story through dialogue, actions, and setting. FortuneFavorsBold and Requitefahrenheit were also mild inspiration. I tried to adhere to legitimate scientific principles where I could and also provide some scientific background and insight into Prometheus Labs. They are a technology company after all. The format I used is a watered-down version of a typical grant request. While creating this, I tried to think about how Prometheus Labs operated. It develops these anomalous objects for a purpose, right? What is that purpose? Why did Prometheus Labs think it was a good idea to create these?//

[[tab Information]]
Prometheus Labs is first and foremost a research and development corporation. There are many problems that we are working to solve, but as a for-profit company, there are limited funds available to solve them. Therefore, Prometheus Labs must prioritize funding for those projects and research that we feel deserve it. 
 However, we pride ourselves on the independent research performed by our world-class scientists. Products such as the mental web and teleportation were developed by researchers working on their vacation days. For this reason, Prometheus Labs has instituted a policy of independent research for eight hours per week. We have also provided this proposal request form. In the event that you wish to pursue an independent avenue of study full-time, please fill out this form and submit it to Human Resources. Please allow two to four days for processing.
 
**GRANT REQUEST FOR [INSERT PROJECT HERE]**

 This is actually a very heavily watered-down format of a grant proposal and various contests I've competed in. Prometheus Labs is a company with limited funds. Therefore, it must select projects to fund. The problem and solution are self-evident. The business case is basically justifying the creation of the object and whether or not there is a plan to make it work. The use of funding is to make sure that the money poured into the project actually goes to good use. The known issues are a pragmatic way to make sure that this product actually has a future, and that its creator is thinking ahead.

You don't need a bibliography, but it would definitely enhance it.
This format is basically another perspective on SCP objects that Prometheus Labs made. They were designed with a commercial purpose in mind. What was that purpose? What was it intended for? Who was it intended for?
 The format is basically asking you "why would this object be created in the first place?"
It may be more difficult to use this to create a story than you are used to, but it also offers a unique perspective on an SCP: that of its creator.

There is only one thing that needs to be kept in mind when using this format: the road to hell is paved with good intentions.

(Prometheus Labs builds things they think are useful)
