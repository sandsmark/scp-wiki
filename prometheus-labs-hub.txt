[[tab Overview]]

Aeons ago, the Titan Prometheus stole fire from the gods and gave it to humanity. He was punished for his impudence by Zeus. Yet his sacrifice elevated humanity to a higher plane. No longer was fire a mysterious and paranormal object; it was now a tool that benefited humanity and let them become masters of the planet. In the same spirit, Prometheus Labs dedicates itself to developing technology and tools that will aid humanity to surmount the so-far extrinsic realm of the paranormal. Every day, we wonder to ourselves "What could be?" But instead of being content with what is, Prometheus Labs continually redefines the status quo, pushing ourselves to advance our knowledge of the universe and put that knowledge to use. One thousand years ago, it was believed that the universe revolved around the Earth. The revelation that the Earth revolved around the Sun fundamentally changed the way humanity viewed its place in the Universe. Every day, Prometheus Labs makes innovations and discoveries that are equally groundbreaking. We innovate, we dream, we strive, and we succeed. Here at Prometheus Labs, our motto is "There is nothing man was not meant to know."

Prometheus Labs, Incorporated was a private, for-profit corporation that focuses on scientific research and development. Founded in 1892, the company focused exclusively on researching and developing anomalous technology for commercial and private sale and use. Prior to the events of [DATA EXPUNGED] in 1998, Prometheus Labs was considered to be one of the most prolific competitors of the Foundation. It had a large public profile as a purveyor of high-quality electronic, medical and pharmaceutical, automotive, and industrial goods produced from anomalous research. 

In addition, it was affiliated with most of the major Groups of Interest, having engaged in lawsuits with Wondertainment Industries, purchased objects from Marshall, Carter, and Dark, worked with the Church of Maxwellist Writ to develop brain-machine interfaces, designed low-cost food alternatives for Manna Charitable Foundation, sold tools and supplies to the Global Occult Coalition and Chaos Insurgency, and waged industrial espionage against GRU Division "P". Prometheus Labs was neither openly antagonistic nor helpful to the Foundation. The Foundation offered to design custom containment protocols for Prometheus Labs' more volatile objects, but were declined. 

Following [DATA EXPUNGED], many of the projects in development were seized by the Foundation, and surviving personnel taken into the Foundation's employment. It is believed that other Groups of Interest also stole projects and research from other facilities. Prometheus Labs had numerous networks, branches, and affiliates and offices around the world. Although all of these locations had generalized work, they were primarily dedicated to individual specialized fields of research. For instance, the Prometheus Labs branch in Kolkata focused on optical research with lasers, while the New Mexico facility was dedicated to computer sciences. Certain documents indicate that Prometheus Labs also had more esoteric facilities, such as a fully self-sustained facility on Mars which studied nuclear physics and quantum mechanics, and a laboratory in the Marianas Trench that researched planetary engineering. These facilities have yet to be located. In addition, [REDACTED] indicates that Prometheus Labs was making plans to construct a facility in the Jurassic period. It is unclear whether or not this facility was successfully constructed.
 
The company is focused on groundbreaking research and innovation in all manner of disciplines, such as theoretical physics, civil engineering, pure and applied mathematics, molecular gastronomy, zoology, xenobiology, nanorobotics, and more, with enormous implications for humanity and humanity's existence. Prometheus Labs is always looking for candidates with masters and doctoral degrees in all sciences. It offers numerous perks, such as personal healthcare from its world-class physicians, private living space, multiple vacation days, excellent food from the world's finest molecular gastronomists, a chance to fundamentally change the world or even the universe, and starting salaries in excess of $125,000 per year.

[[tab Information]]
Prometheus Labs is first and foremost a research and development corporation. There are many problems that we are working to solve, but as a for-profit company, there are limited funds available to solve them. Therefore, Prometheus Labs must prioritize funding for those projects and research that we feel deserve it. 
 However, we pride ourselves on the independent research performed by our world-class scientists. Products such as the mental web and teleportation were developed by researchers working on their vacation days. For this reason, Prometheus Labs has instituted a policy of independent research for eight hours per week. We have also provided this proposal request form. In the event that you wish to pursue an independent avenue of study full-time, please fill out this form and submit it to Human Resources. Please allow two to four days for processing.
 
**GRANT REQUEST FOR [INSERT PROJECT HERE]**
Do not give your project a special name. Name it based on what it is: a grant request for a scientific question.

**ABSTRACT**
What are you trying to achieve? What problem are you trying to solve?
Explain the issue in great detail. Make it clear why this is a problem that Prometheus Labs should work on.

**SOLUTION**
Explain the proposed technology solution. How exactly does it work? What does it do to solve the problem? What is the technology and/or the research behind the proposal that supports its viability? What are the benefits of the technology and/or research?  Bibliographies recommended.

**BUSINESS CASE**
Who will purchase or use this product or knowledge? Give demographics (age group, ethnicity, economic class, etc. ). List potential markets. If it is a product, what makes this product different from similar products already on the market? What makes it a more appealing choice? How will the use and/or sale of this research and/or technology benefit Prometheus Labs or scientific knowledge?

**USE OF FUNDING**
You are asking for funding to support development and research of this concept. What will the funds go into? What will they be used for? What will the funds purchase? Who will they hire? Give a timetable for expected lengths of work and dates of completion, a list of materials and tools to be used for the project, a list of necessary contractors, and the price ranges for all. 

**KNOWN ISSUES**
What are the major stumbling blocks to the adoption, widespread use, and/or profitability of this research and/or technology? Known bugs, difficulties in bringing to market, project failures, etc. How can these issues be fixed?

Out of universe talk. You're probably wondering why all this is necessary, and why it's so much more complex than the base SCP format. This is actually a very heavily watered-down format of a grant proposal and various contests I've competed in. Prometheus Labs is a company with limited funds. Therefore, it must select projects to fund. The abstract asks you for a problem that needs solving. The solution is self-evident. The business case is basically justifying the creation of the object and whether or not there is a plan to make it work. The use of funding is to make sure that the money poured into the project actually goes to good use. The known issues are a pragmatic way to make sure that this product actually has a future, and that its creator is thinking ahead.

You don't need a bibliography, but it would definitely enhance it.
This format is basically another perspective on SCP objects that Prometheus Labs made. They were designed with a commercial purpose in mind. What was that purpose? What was it intended for? Who was it intended for?
 The format is basically asking you "why would this object be created in the first place?"
It may be more difficult than you are used to, but it also offers a unique perspective on an SCP: that of its creator.
