**Item #:** SCP-@#%&!

**Object Class:** __//**X**//__

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-@#%&!’s containment cell is to be flooded with Dr. Bronner's brand peppermint soap in the event that SCP-@#%&!'s secondary effect exceeds containment capacity. SCP-@#%&!'s effect is currently in the process of being studied so that we might do away with it.

**Description:** SCP-@#%&! is the designation given to a very rude bird capable of producing human speech despite its anatomy suggesting it would not possess such a capability.

SCP-@#%&! uses curse words almost exclusively. It is not know where SCP-@#%&! learned the words or why it chooses to use them when other words are available. 

**Addendum G:** SCP-@#%&! creates new curse words every time it speaks. 

**Addendum PG:** //Curse words really only have the power that we give them. I suggest the document be revised with this perspective.// -Dr. ████

//███ you, try me.// — SCP-@#%&!

**Addendum PG-13:** //SCP-@#%&! has breached containment, acquiring celebrity status due to incessant media attention paid to its unruly behavior. As it has not actually left Site-██ it is believed its popularity will burn itself out before too long and make re-containment viable.//


**Addendum NC-17:** SCP-@#%&! has retired after its tie-in video game flopped harder than a dead bird off a wind turbine.
