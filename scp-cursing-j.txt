**Item #:** SCP-@#%&!

**Object Class:** __//**X**//__

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-@#%&!’s containment cell is to be flooded with Dr. Bronner's brand peppermint soap in the event that SCP-@#%&!'s secondary effect exceeds containment capacity. SCP-@#%&!'s effect is currently in the process of being studied so that we might do away with it.

All personnel assigned to SCP-@#%&! must rotate out for one month of psychological counseling after two months on-site. Personnel assigned to SCP-@#%&! must undergo heavy psychological testing before being cleared to enter the site.

**Description:** SCP-@#%&! is the designation given to a bird with the anomalous capability of producing human speech. It is not known by what mechanism that the subject is capable of speaking, its anatomy would suggest that it would not be capable. Continuous research is ongoing in regards to what exotic process or material would give a mundane animal the ability to talk. 

SCP-@#%&! secondary effect is that it uses curse words almost exclusively. It is not know where SCP-@#%&! learned the words or why it chooses to use them when other words are available. 

SCP-@#%&! creates new curse words every time it speaks. 

SCP-@#%&! is rude.

**Addendum G:** I don't know anything about animals but a reverse image search reveals that this type of bird is a finch. -Dr. █████

**Addendum PG:** Curse words really only have the power that we give them. I suggest the document be revised with this perspective. -Dr. ████

**Addendum PG-13:** //SCP-@#%&! has breached containment and become a media sensation. However, as it has not actually left Site-██ it is believed its popularity will burn itself out before too long and make re-containing it’s star power viable.//

**Addendum R:** Excerpt from interview conducted on "Dr. Gerald", an intrasite television program.

> **Dr. Gerald:** You are the father.
> 
> **SCP-@#%&!:** Sir, I am a █████████  ███ING bird.

> **Dr. Gerald:** Well we have someone here we'd like you to meet.
