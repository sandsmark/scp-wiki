> {{How are you, my wife? I hope all is well at Magdeburg. As you may have heard from the radio, we have attained victory in the September Campaign. More importantly, I am alright. We may have married in haste for fear of the worst, but it appears that our fears were unfounded. Nonetheless, that spur of the moment gave me reason to fight on. I owe it to those church bells that gave us that thought. At least among my fellows, I know what I am fighting for. You.}}

> {{Merry Christmas, my wife. I have received your previous letter and am astonished. To think that it took only that one night to conceive a child, this is wonderful news. There was so little time, and we overcame it. This is absolutely encouraging to me.}}
> 
> {{That being said, I am sad that I cannot be with you during your pregnancy. There is still so much to be done here. Seek help from our parents, for I am sure they will help. We must discuss on the name at a later date.}}

> {{My wife, thank you. Your words certainly hold a soothing influence over me. If only you were present by my side, the influence would dispel all ill thoughts at once.}}
> 
> {{I have taken time to reflect on your previous letter, and acknowledged some of it to be correct. I still do abide by my personal belief that my [http://www.scp-wiki.net/keine-kosten-zu-hoch rejected proposal to PROJECT KOLOSS] was intended to deny me of directorship. It might have applied //untermensch// superstition, but that is but a social construct. Regardless, I agree that [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-044 the current director] is not at fault. He is a fellow patriot, as you said. So long the Reich benefits, there is no need to fight over appointments. I am already at a high rank as it is.}}
> 
> {{But enough of my rants over work matters. I hope the family is doing well. I am pleased that you speak so highly of me to Elisabet. I only pray that I can tell her my various exploits myself. KOLOSS was a misstep, but do tell her that too. Elisabet can learn from her father's experience.}}

> {{My wife, I hope that the family’s resettlement in Breslau has been progressing well since my last correspondence with you. It is regretful that I cannot be there by your side, but we know that the Reich needs me more. Now more than ever before.}} 
> 
> {{You should know by now that the Reich has not been faring well since the disastrous ventures at the Eastern Front. Our enemies are indeed overwhelming us, even with our stock of //wunderwaffe//. Perhaps my rejected proposals might have changed the outcome, but there is no reason to speculate.}}   
> 
> {{Thus, selected colleagues and I have been preparing for a change in tactics, from offense to defence. It is a matter of time before they overrun the Reich entirely, therefore we must defend. Ah Time, it once again brought us trouble, like our marriage. We began to know each other too late, and rushed through it due to coincidence. Additionally, it took only that first and last night to conceive Elisabet. Certainly, Elisabet and our marriage are at least our meagre victory against Time. Thus, it is fitting to name this defence initiative //[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2367 'die Glocke']//, after the bells that began our tale of victory. The enemies can tear themselves apart, but we shall rise victorious from their corpses. And by ‘we’, you and Elisabet are definitely included.}} 
> 
> {{Leave the settlement and come to me in our base at the Owl Mountains, where //die Glocke// awaits. The security detail will escort you there, should you give the order (They know the path). We can be together again and //die Glocke// will guarantee that Time shall never impede us.}} 
> 
> {{We will not leave without you and Elisabet. As //Obergruppenführer//, I promise.}}
