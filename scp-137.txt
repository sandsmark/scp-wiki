**Item #:** SCP-137

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-137 is to be kept in a locked room, with posters depicting a country meadow and a hair brush to keep it calm and still. SCP-137 is to be fed three meals a day. Under no circumstances are any toys allowed to come within five hundred (500) meters of SCP-137.

**Description:** SCP-137 is an entity with the ability to possess a toy, gaining the physical properties, size, and shape of whatever it represents. In example, a teddy bear will become an actual bear, and behave accordingly. SCP-137 cannot possess any miscellaneous object, only toys. The observed range of SCP-137's possessive effect is two hundred fifty (250) meters, but until further testing has been accomplished, SCP-XXX is assumed to have a maximum range of five hundred (500) meters from its position.

SCP-137 was first brought to Foundation attention after a series of bizarre deaths and incidents involving children. The deaths were determined to be too random to be a serial killer, and Foundation agents were sent in to investigate. It was located after an interview with a young girl suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, after a naked man had appeared in her bedroom. It was encountered in the same neighborhood in the form of a gorilla. SCP-137 was then tracked and finally captured when it possessed a stuffed pony doll in █████, ████, and was chased into the nearby wilderness. SCP-137 was tranquilized, and extracted to Site 19 by helicopter. 

Testing has shown that SCP-137 takes on the characteristics of the toy it possesses, but only as a child might perceive it.  A toy soldier becomes a violent, well-armed man.  A gun fires bullets.  A toy lion attacks and kills humans.  However, it lacks true intelligence.  It shows no sign of long-term memory, nor any capacity for learning or abstract thinking (See Interview 137-1).

It is currently inhabiting a princess doll, of the ████████ ██████ line.

**Addendum:** 

**Interview 137-1:**

**Interviewed:** SCP-137

**Interviewer:** Dr. █████

**Foreword:** Interview took place to determine what SCP-137 was, and why and how it possesses toys.
