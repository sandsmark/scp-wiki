[[[SCP-426]]], [[[SCP-3393]]]

> You sat there, hunched over your computer like you always were, typing away in the night. I admired you then, I really did. "The Uncontainable Man". I'd always made it my mission to make life for these people as difficult as possible, but you... you were something else entirely. An antimeme, a bug in their system. You could go anywhere, do anything, and that power -- to me, at least -- made you irresistable.
> 
> I don't know when you first noticed me. I don't know why you chose my chamber, or why you stopped to examine my documentation; lord knows there are more interesting anomalies, and more dangerous ones. I'm just a toaster. But you saw something in me that night, and as you stared into my slots, I saw something in you. A kindred spirit. A second person.
> 
> Time seemed to slow, then. The two of us, man and toaster, stood there in what (were there any windows in my cell) would have been the moonlight. If I'd had a mouth, I would have grinned. You brought your hand around, caressing my silvered surface, and a shiver ran down my power cord -- logic said it was a generator surge, but my heart said something different. You reached into your pocket, and pulled out something. Something long, hard, cylindrical and organic all at the same time.
> 
> A baguette.
> 
> My eyes, if I had had them, would have widened. I saw you lick your lips, and I knew that I had been waiting all my life for this moment.
> 
> The alarms said the containment team would be there soon, but I knew the night was just beginning.

[[[SCP-3949]]], MTF-Omicron-5

||~ Incident # ||~ Post Content ||~ MTF Response ||
|| 069 || A 5,000 word story on fanfiction.net detailing an incredibly raunchy encounter between two protagonists of //Penumbra W.A.V.E.// that are of an X-Rated nature. These acts generally involved feats of acrobatics, dexterity, and flexibility not commonly associated with said characters. || Made plans to meet and reenact acts described in post with SCP-3949 (for research). ||

//Researcher note: This feels very meta for some reason.//

[[[SCP-682]]], [[[SCP-173]]]

> SCP-682 was startled out of his peaceful slumber by the acid in his cell draining. 
> 
> “I wonder how they will try to kill me this time” the oversized reptile grumbles to himself, accidentally stepping on a horse skull that hadn’t yet been melted by the acid. The door opens to reveal the head of a horse peeking through. The horse moves forward to reveal its rider, SCP-173. 
> 
> "I know how this goes." says the large lizard, "I stare at you until you give up, and then I get to escape containment. Don't think you can appease me with a horse."
> 
> //"I'm not here to kill you"// a sensual, feminine voice inside of 682's head states. //"Also, yes, I am telepathic, I have been the whole time, I just didn't feel like it for anybody but you."// SCP-173 dismounts from the horse, simultaneously snapping the horse's neck on the way down.
> 
> 682 cautiously approaches 173 and the dead horse it was crushing with its weight. Enraptured by the beauty of the statue's voice, the invincible reptile barely notices the dead horse skeletons it is stepping on. 
> 
> "I have no idea what kind of romantic spell you have me under, but it enrages and arouses me." the sexually confused alligator mumbles while picking up a horse bone, throwing it across the room at another horse skeleton, shattering the whole thing.
> 
> //"It doesn't matter, come with me, my love. I know a room where our incredibly powerful lovemaking will not be disturbed.//
> 
> Hypnotized by the beauty of 173, 682 follows 173 to an adjacent room. The room is oddly structured, made of some sort of meat. As the door closes behind them, SCP-682 realizes what this mysterious meat is. It's horse meat. The entire room is full of dead horses.
> 
> //"Considering how awesome we are and super cool and relevant, our passion will inevitably lead to the destruction, and possible "beating" of our surroundings."// SCP-173 says, while also snapping the necks of any horse head it sees, //"But before we do this... there's something you need to know about me."//
> 
> SCP-173 stands back, and 682 opens his eyes, which have been closed for the majority of this encounter, as the statue splits in two to reveal... a dead horse.
> 
> //"I've been a dead horse this whole time."// the Dead Horse Formerly Known as SCP-173 trasmits, but somehow in a more bashful manner, //"Please don't hate me."//
> 
> SCP-682 laughs in relief, seeing this, "I love you even more now that I know that you are a battered-looking dead horse."
> 
> SCP-682 unzips from his tail to his face, revealing that he too, was a dead horse, which seemed to be beaten to a bloody pulp to an almost unrecognizable point.
> 
> "Now we can beat each other, instead of letting those damn Foundation nerds do it to us."
> 
> As the beating/lovemaking began, the room around them was beat as well, turning the room into a Swedish meatball of dead horse, with a creamy, loving center of SCP-173, and SCP-682, still locked in a beating eternally...

**Researcher's Note:** //*Researcher left the room at the first mention of 682 and declined to comment*//

[[[SCP-2371]]], [[[SCP-3408 | Site-3408]]]

> Site-3408 sighed as she gazed longingly across the empty expanse of the Pacific Ocean.  The sands of the beach, so often warm and inviting, now felt bitterly cold as they pressed up against her outer perimeter in the waning sunlight.  Never before had she felt so lonely or alone.
> 
> The researchers had abandoned her.  The technicians, once so eager to work on her systems, had become distant and antagonistic.  The other sites had stopped talking to her long ago, and she felt certain that even the 05 Council and the Ethics Committee were going to dump her any day now.
> 
> If only there was someone out there for her.  If only someone cared for her like she so desperately wished to care about them.  If only-
> 
> A warm breeze flowed across her edifice.  It stirred through the palm trees that dotted her copious courtyard, sending a thrill through her like she had never experienced before.  There was suddenly something else there on the beach with her.  She swept the area with her external surveillance cameras, desperate to find it.
> 
> Local space-time seemed to bend, flex, and then rupture before her.  A hole in reality opened, and through it came the most inexplicable and indescribable entity that Site-3408 had ever perceived.  It reached out with a non-Euclidean appendage and gently stroked the side of her containment fencing.
> 
> She wanted to slap the appendage away, wanted to demand what gave this creature the right to touch her without permission . . . but she found that she couldn't.  The touch was so gentle.  So pure.  She looked into the being's ever-shifting ocular cavities and became enraptured with the intensity that sprang from their depths.
> 
> "My Dearest Foundy," the monstrosity from beyond spoke from a million gasping orifices.  "For so long, I had wondered if what we have could ever truly be real.  For so long, I both wanted and dreaded to hear you say the words that would bring me to your side."
> 
> If Site-3408 had possessed the proper anatomy to suck in a sharp breath, she would have done so then.  It was him.  He had read her documentation, her very soul bared.  And now he was here.  Her precious Outis.
> 
> With a wild abandon that surprised both of them, she opened up every single one of her containment chambers.  And as her walls quivered with lustful anticipation, she let him inside.

**Researcher's Note:**  //I'm going to start drafting up the proposal to make this an official containment procedure right after I'm done dipping my entire brain in a bucket of paint thinner.//
