[[[SCP-426]]], [[[SCP-3393]]]

> You sat there, hunched over your computer like you always were, typing away in the night. I admired you then, I really did. "The Uncontainable Man". I'd always made it my mission to make life for these people as difficult as possible, but you... you were something else entirely. An antimeme, a bug in their system. You could go anywhere, do anything, and that power -- to me, at least -- made you irresistable.
> 
> I don't know when you first noticed me. I don't know why you chose my chamber, or why you stopped to examine my documentation; lord knows there are more interesting anomalies, and more dangerous ones. I'm just a toaster. But you saw something in me that night, and as you stared into my slots, I saw something in you. A kindred spirit. A second person.
> 
> Time seemed to slow, then. The two of us, man and toaster, stood there in what (were there any windows in my cell) would have been the moonlight. If I'd had a mouth, I would have grinned. You brought your hand around, caressing my silvered surface, and a shiver ran down my power cord -- logic said it was a generator surge, but my heart said something different. You reached into your pocket, and pulled out something. Something long, hard, cylindrical and organic all at the same time.
> 
> A baguette.
> 
> My eyes, if I had had them, would have widened. I saw you lick your lips, and I knew that I had been waiting all my life for this moment.
> 
> The alarms said the containment team would be there soon, but I knew the night was just beginning.

[[[SCP-3949]]], MTF-Omicron-5

||~ Incident # ||~ Post Content ||~ MTF Response ||
|| 069 || A 5,000 word story on fanfiction.net detailing an incredibly raunchy encounter between two protagonists of //Penumbra W.A.V.E.// that are of an X-Rated nature. These acts generally involved feats of acrobatics, dexterity, and flexibility not commonly associated with said characters. || Made plans to meet and reenact acts described in post with SCP-3949 (for research). ||

//Researcher note: This feels very meta for some reason.//

[[[SCP-682]]], [[[SCP-173]]]

> SCP-682 was startled out of his peaceful slumber by the acid in his cell draining. 
> 
> “I wonder how they will try to kill me this time” the oversized reptile grumbles to himself, accidentally stepping on a horse skull that hadn’t yet been melted by the acid. The door opens to reveal the head of a horse peeking through. The horse moves forward to reveal its rider, SCP-173. 
> 
> "I know how this goes." says the large lizard, "I stare at you until you give up, and then I get to escape containment. Don't think you can appease me with a horse."
> 
> //"I'm not here to kill you"// a sensual, feminine voice inside of 682's head states. //"Also, yes, I am telepathic, I have been the whole time, I just didn't feel like it for anybody but you."// SCP-173 dismounts from the horse, simultaneously snapping the horse's neck on the way down.
> 
> 682 cautiously approaches 173 and the dead horse it was crushing with its weight. Enraptured by the beauty of the statue's voice, the invincible reptile barely notices the dead horse skeletons it is stepping on. 
> 
> "I have no idea what kind of romantic spell you have me under, but it enrages and arouses me." the sexually confused alligator mumbles while picking up a horse bone, throwing it across the room at another horse skeleton, shattering the whole thing.
> 
> //"It doesn't matter, come with me, my love. I know a room where our incredibly powerful lovemaking will not be disturbed.//
> 
> Hypnotized by the beauty of 173, 682 follows 173 to an adjacent room. The room is oddly structured, made of some sort of meat. As the door closes behind them, SCP-682 realizes what this mysterious meat is. It's horse meat. The entire room is full of dead horses.
> 
> //"Considering how awesome we are and super cool and relevant, our passion will inevitably lead to the destruction, and possible "beating" of our surroundings."// SCP-173 says, while also snapping the necks of any horse head it sees, //"But before we do this... there's something you need to know about me."//
> 
> SCP-173 stands back, and 682 opens his eyes, which have been closed for the majority of this encounter, as the statue splits in two to reveal... a dead horse.
> 
> //"I've been a dead horse this whole time."// the Dead Horse Formerly Known as SCP-173 trasmits, but somehow in a more bashful manner, //"Please don't hate me."//
> 
> SCP-682 laughs in relief, seeing this, "I love you even more now that I know that you are a battered-looking dead horse."
> 
> SCP-682 unzips from his tail to his face, revealing that he too, was a dead horse, which seemed to be beaten to a bloody pulp to an almost unrecognizable point.
> 
> "Now we can beat each other, instead of letting those damn Foundation nerds do it to us."
> 
> As the beating/lovemaking began, the room around them was beat as well, turning the room into a Swedish meatball of dead horse, with a creamy, loving center of SCP-173, and SCP-682, still locked in a beating eternally...

**Researcher's Note:** //*Researcher left the room at the first mention of 682 and declined to comment*//
