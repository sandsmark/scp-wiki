> You sat there, hunched over your computer like you always were, typing away in the night. I admired you then, I really did. "The Uncontainable Man". I'd always made it my mission to make life for these people as difficult as possible, but you... you were something else entirely. An antimeme, a bug in their system. You could go anywhere, do anything, and that power -- to me, at least -- made you irresistable.
> 
> I don't know when you first noticed me. I don't know why you chose my chamber, or why you stopped to examine my documentation; lord knows there are more interesting anomalies, and more dangerous ones. I'm just a toaster. But you saw something in me that night, and as you stared into my slots, I saw something in you. A kindred spirit. A second person.
> 
> Time seemed to slow, then. The two of us, man and toaster, stood there in what (were there any windows in my cell) would have been the moonlight. If I'd had a mouth, I would have grinned. You brought your hand around, caressing my silvered surface, and a shiver ran down my power cord -- logic said it was a generator surge, but my heart said something different. You reached into your pocket, and pulled out something. Something long, hard, cylindrical and organic all at the same time.
> 
> A baguette.
> 
> My eyes, if I had had them, would have widened. I saw you lick your lips, and I knew that I had been waiting all my life for this moment.
> 
> The alarms said the containment team would be there soon, but I knew the night was just beginning.

[[[SCP-682]]], [[[SCP-173]]]

> SCP-682 was startled out of his peaceful slumber by the acid in his cell draining. 
> 
> “I wonder how they will try to kill me this time” the oversized reptile grumbles to himself, accidentally stepping on a horse skull that hadn’t yet been melted by the acid. The door opens to reveal the head of a horse peeking through. The horse moves forward to reveal its rider, SCP-173. 
> 
> "I know how this goes." says the large lizard, "I stare at you until you give up, and then I get to escape containment. Don't think you can appease me with a horse."
> 
> //"I'm not here to kill you"// a sensual, feminine voice inside of 682's head states. //"Also, yes, I am telepathic, I have been the whole time, I just didn't feel like it for anybody but you."// SCP-173 dismounts from the horse, simultaneously snapping the horse's neck on the way down.
> 
> 682 cautiously approaches 173 and the dead horse it was crushing with its weight. Enraptured by the beauty of the statue's voice, the invincible reptile barely notices the dead horse skeletons it is stepping on. 
> 
> "I have no idea what kind of romantic spell you have me under, but it enrages and arouses me." the sexually confused alligator mumbles while picking up a horse bone, throwing it across the room at another horse skeleton, shattering the whole thing.
> 
> //"It doesn't matter, come with me, my love. I know a room where our incredibly powerful lovemaking will not be disturbed.//
> 
> Hypnotized by the beauty of 173, 682 follows 173 to an adjacent room. The room is oddly structured, made of some sort of meat. As the door closes behind them, SCP-682 realizes what this mysterious meat is. It's horse meat. The entire room is full of dead horses.
> 
> //"Considering how awesome we are and super cool and relevant, our passion will inevitably lead to the destruction, and possible "beating" of our surroundings."// SCP-173 says, while also snapping the necks of any horse head it sees, //"But before we do this... there's something you need to know about me."//
> 
> SCP-173 stands back, and 682 opens his eyes, which have been closed for the majority of this encounter, as the statue splits in two to reveal... a dead horse.
> 
> //"I've been a dead horse this whole time."// the Dead Horse Formerly Known as SCP-173 trasmits, but somehow in a more bashful manner, //"Please don't hate me."//
> 
> SCP-682 laughs in relief, seeing this, "I love you even more now that I know that you are a battered-looking dead horse."
> 
> SCP-682 unzips from his tail to his face, revealing that he too, was a dead horse, which seemed to be beaten to a bloody pulp to an almost unrecognizable point.
> 
> "Now we can beat each other, instead of letting those damn Foundation nerds do it to us."
> 
> As the beating/lovemaking began, the room around them was beat as well, turning the room into a Swedish meatball of dead horse, with a creamy, loving center of SCP-173, and SCP-682, still locked in a beating eternally...

**Researcher's Note:** //*Researcher left the room at the first mention of 682 and declined to comment*//

[[[SCP-2371]]], [[[SCP-3408 | Site-3408]]]

> Site-3408 sighed as she gazed longingly across the empty expanse of the Pacific Ocean.  The sands of the beach, so often warm and inviting, now felt bitterly cold as they pressed up against her outer perimeter in the waning sunlight.  Never before had she felt so lonely or alone.
> 
> The researchers had abandoned her.  The technicians, once so eager to work on her systems, had become distant and antagonistic.  The other sites had stopped talking to her long ago, and she felt certain that even the 05 Council and the Ethics Committee were going to dump her any day now.
> 
> If only there was someone out there for her.  If only someone cared for her like she so desperately wished to care about them.  If only-
> 
> A warm breeze flowed across her edifice.  It stirred through the palm trees that dotted her copious courtyard, sending a thrill through her like she had never experienced before.  There was suddenly something else there on the beach with her.  She swept the area with her external surveillance cameras, desperate to find it.
> 
> Local space-time seemed to bend, flex, and then rupture before her.  A hole in reality opened, and through it came the most inexplicable and indescribable entity that Site-3408 had ever perceived.  It reached out with a non-Euclidean appendage and gently stroked the side of her containment fencing.
> 
> She wanted to slap the appendage away, wanted to demand what gave this creature the right to touch her without permission . . . but she found that she couldn't.  The touch was so gentle.  So pure.  She looked into the being's ever-shifting ocular cavities and became enraptured with the intensity that sprang from their depths.
> 
> "My Dearest Foundy," the monstrosity from beyond spoke from a million gasping orifices.  "For so long, I had wondered if what we have could ever truly be real.  For so long, I both wanted and dreaded to hear you say the words that would bring me to your side."
> 
> If Site-3408 had possessed the proper anatomy to suck in a sharp breath, she would have done so then.  It was him.  He had read her documentation, her very soul bared.  And now he was here.  Her precious Outis.
> 
> With a wild abandon that surprised both of them, she opened up every single one of her containment chambers.  And as her walls quivered with lustful anticipation, she let him inside.

**Researcher's Note:**  //I'm going to start drafting up the proposal to make this an official containment procedure right after I'm done dipping my entire brain in a bucket of paint thinner.//

> **Item #:** SCP-3999
> 
> **Object Class:** Neutralized
> 
> **Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3999 was contained at Site 118 in a Little Caesar’s pizza box. Four armed guards were found stationed outside this box. The interior of this box consisted of cardboard, grease, and a few pieces of crust. There is little information concerning other containment procedures relating to SCP-3999.
> 
> **Description:**  SCP-3999 was, apparently, a Keter class object, possibly a pizza of some kind. It is currently unknown what other properties SCP-3999 might have had. SCP-3999's containment box was discovered during a routine inspection of all Keter class containment chambers at Site 118. RAISA has confirmed that no records of SCP-3999 exist within the database; all information concerning the nature of SCP-3999 has been determined based on the containment box's composition and recovered documentation from within. The four guards "assigned" to SCP-3999 were found to have significant memory loss, and could not determine how they got to SCP-3999.
> @@ @@
> Right beside SCP-3999's containment box, the corpse of Level 3 Researcher James Talloran was found. Researcher Talloran had excused himself to SCP-3999’s containment almost directly following reassignment to Site 118. A Foundation-assigned cell phone was found on his body, containing only a piece of text resembling a containment procedure for SCP-3999, but with many stylistic deviations and nonsensical procedures as well as strange passages vividly detailing Researcher Talloran engaging in various sexual activities with a pizza. From it, it has been determined that Researcher Talloran was assigned to SCP-3999, SCP-3999 had significant reality warping properties, it breached containment at some point and caused either a CK-class reality-restructuring event or an extreme attraction to pizza in Researcher Talloran, and it was successfully terminated by Researcher Talloran at the cost of [DATA EXPUNGED BY O5-COMMAND], reversing said event.

//**Researcher’s Note:** Talloran didn’t die for this.//

> The head floated in space aimlessly, alone, afraid, and most of all; cold. Arah was gone. Her sweet Arah has left her forever. Thus, she had decided to give up on waiting for her. She pushed herself out into the great oblivion, starting over, searching for a new purpose.
> 
> As she wandered through the void, her acute depression only worsened. It was so fucking cold. She just didn't know what to do next with her life. She had spent so much time with Arah that it felt the world was but an empty shell without her. 
> 
> And then she heard //him//.

> "Hey, you," the gas giant said. His voice was rough and harsh, like the douchebag satellite that had pestered the head back near Arah's corpse. "What's up with you, eh? You look down as gravity."

> "EXCUSE ME?" she said, angered at his belittling attitude.

> 
> "WOAH! WHAT HAPPENED HERE, Á∆∂∑øå-SAMA?"

> "Well, the planet was probably already destroyed because it took so long to get here. Like, it took //thousands// of years for us to move and inch. And stop calling me that."
> 
> "HOW INTERESTING, Á∆∂∑øå-SAMA. WELL, I CONSIDER THIS A VICTORY!"
> 
> "Please, lady, I know times are tough, but you have to control--" The head began to blush, impressed by Á∆∂∑øå's intelligence.
> 
> "Y-Y'KNOW, Á∆∂∑øå-SAMA, I THINK YOU'RE REALLY COOL..." The head'd body/head tingled with lust. She gawked aimlessly at his iron tendrils, plasma force fields, and eldritch space anomalies. 
> 
> "Uhhhhh, what?"
> 
> "Á∆∂∑øå... I... I THINK I-I'M IN LOVE WITH YOU."

> The depictions she'd seen, accounts she read, nothing compared to the real thing. A great, pulsating mountain of flesh spilled across the cavern like molasses, bloated with viscera and vampire and vermian. Kilometers of darkness ebbed and merged with miles of bio-luminescent globules of flesh. All coalesced, Dr. Low could see, into the impossibly massive form of a woman from the waist up, pale, voluptuous, tattoos pulsing with an impossibly bright red.
> 
> The Brood Mother leered, leaned in, examined the pitifully small doctor below. Lovataar's ample chest rose and fell far slower than a human's, yet the rare exhale brought with it a cloyingly sweet wave of breath.

> "//Hey cutie~.//"

> The things Dr. Low did to get laid these days.

**Researcher's Note:** //I'm actually starting to get a little curious as to whether or not these are truly randomized, or if there's some sort of connection to each of the depicted figures. On that note, I am __not__ looking forward to my upcoming 610 assignment.//

> **Dr. Glass:** S-so, Mr. Chappell, how's... t-tell me about yourself.
> 
> **SCP-046-ARC:** Normally my favorite subject, but really I mean, where do I start? Me and Mr. Night, we were running the biggest operation Chicago's ever seen. We sold more hooch than Coke sold soda, our profits were putting Rockafeller to shame. And I don't know about Mr. Night, but that ain't bad for a hunk-leaning otter from the South Side.

> Dr. Robert Scranton stirred in Saint Nicholas's cool grasp, but did not open his eyes. "Mmm?"
> 
> "I..." Scranton could feel his grip tighten, frosted arms pressed tighter around the old man's torso. A silent declaration of //I don't want this to end//, vindicated by Nicholas's subsequent words: "I don't want this to end."

> Scranton smiled, and moved to turn over, but it was for naught. Nicky's grip was far too tight. "Me neither, Nicky. You always leave the trenches a little brighter."

"I feel like if I let go, the rest of my eternity will just pass by like nothing. I don't know what I'm doing with my life. I've been telling myself, maybe if I keep making toys I'll figure something out. It's all one long ad-lib, and you're the only thing that makes sense, Rob. I love you."

> "Begone, foul snake of the void!" shouted Moon Champion, wrangling with a mass of matte-black material.
> 
> Moon Champion had found himself in a most strange predicament, as for the past two days he had engaged in fierce battle with a lengthy serpent as black as the night and more slippery than a slug. Yet, despite his valiant efforts, the creature had refused to yield and continued to swirl around him, mockingly. 
> 
> But Moon Champion feared not, as he had a most magnificent plan! For while the body of this putrid monster could coil about, unaffected by his great Lunar-might, its head would surely not be able to do the same! So he tugged, and pulled, and rapidly maneuvered through the grand arcs and loops that the creature hand made of itself until finally, Moon Champion had found where it all had led, and he gazed into the abyss-!
> 
> -and the abyss gazed back, in the form of a woman curled up in the fetal position, panting as wildly as you could imagine while still remaining monotone. It appeared that Moon Champion had been pulling her hair for several days now.
> 
> "He... Hello... I am Sauelsuesor"

> She had [LEVEL 4 CREDENTIALS REQUIRED] darker than space itself, and golden [LEVEL 4/179 CREDENTIALS REQUIRED] which gleamed like the sun. Moon Champion took a moment to collect himself, for his sacred Moon Saber had been quickly unsheathing.
