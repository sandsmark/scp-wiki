“Arorangi” is our name for our own lil’ kakapo! Though she doesn’t look like it, Arorangi is actually a parrot. Although she can’t fly or chirp like the rest of them, she has a charm of her own which just makes her unique and we love her all the more for it.

Kakapos are also known as ‘owl parrots’. It makes sense: Arorangi has a startlingly owlish face along with some lovely soft green plumage. She’s even nocturnal so you sure could be forgiven for thinking that Arorangi was some combination of the two.

Arorangi was actually brought to our little organisation here in Clackamas County all the way from New Zealand! New Zealand is a teeny country down by Australia. It really is incredible that Arorangi came from a place as small as that. The Supervisors had her specially shipped over on account of us being the "most reliable anomalous animal caretakers". Needless to say, we're touched.

Arorangi’s pretty old. So old that she had her 200th birthday last week! We don't know her precise birthday, but that's when we got her.

Anyhoo, being that old can get pretty tiring, so she naps a lot. But when Arorangi’s awake, she’s the sweetest little thing. You can come right up to her and give her a cuddle and she won’t mind it a bit. You gotta be careful about disturbing her naps, though. She can get pretty cranky.

Arorangi has been around for a good long time. The Supervisors told us when we first got her that they had run a few tests before sending her over to us and concluded that she’s around about 200 years old! She must have been a tough one to get all the way here. Now it’s our job to keep her safe and happy.

There are only around 140 of these cute ‘lil critters left alive, and most of them have been put on a few islands to keep them safe from predators and the like. Apparently, some of the people monitoring her noticed that she was living long past usual age of a kakapo. Luckily the Supervisors got involved before anything bad could happen and sent her over to us. Arorangi is nice and safe, so it seems like a good arrangement to me.

Special Needs and Accommodations!

Enclosure 13 was always designed to be nice and cosy for injured animals, so we knew instantly that it’d be the perfect place for our little Arorangi. We did a bit of shuffling around and walled off a spot that was just perfect for her. We threw in a few ferns and put some bark on the ground and she made herself right at home. Of course, later we had time to build a bigger enclosure, which was better suited for her needs. 

The new Enclosure 16 has a small pond, a couple of perches, and even a little sugar-water dispenser. It’s also kept lit with a few red lights which Arorangi has a hard time seeing. How handy is that!

Arorangi is pretty easygoin’ on account of her age. Now I’m no spring chicken myself but going off of the number of hours of sleep she gets a day, she definitely has me beat. She spends most of her time sleeping and she usually only gets up late at night to have a small stroll and a drink. Unfortunately, this means Arorangi is a bit too old to take care of herself, so Daniel spends a lot of his time with her.

Notes about Arorangi!

**Tim Wilson's Caretaking Notes.**

[[collapsible show="Show Notes" hide="Hide Notes"]]
**Date: 02/01/04**
Arorangi arrived today. Five days in a shipping container and she didn't look too bad. The person who'd been caring for her on the way here looked a bit sad to see her go, but she left pretty much immediately after dropping the critter off. The critter sure wasn't what I had expected. She's pretty much just a lump of green fur. Anyway, seems pretty low maintenance so we'll put her in Enclosure 13 for now.

**Date: 02/03/04**
I've found the time to look at a few more of the files concerning Arorangi. Seems like she's gonna need more help than I thought. I'll get the guys to sort out a better habitat. I'll also have to assign Daniel to be more or less her full-time caretaker. He can handle it. She spends most of her time sleeping, anyway.

**Date: 02/17/04**
New enclosure completed today. Arorangi moved in and seems pretty pleased. So am I, now that we have full access to 13 again.

**Date: 03/05/04**
It's Arorangi's birthday! We don't actually know her birthday so we just decided to have it today. I also gave her some almonds and she loved ‘em. I reckon they'll be her new treat now.

**Date: 04/16/04**
We've given Arorangi a full physical checkup after Daniel saw her limping a little. It turns out that some of the muscles in her legs have withered. We're getting some of those leg therapy doodads that dogs use. We're also putting extra nutrient pills in her food. I'm hoping this doesn't need to involve surgery.

**Date: 05/15/04**
Arorangi has made something of a recovery. She's perked up and is finally able to walk short distances. I've never seen Daniel so happy. We'll keep her in the leg therapy gear for a bit longer to make sure the healing process is completed.

**Date: 11/26/04**
Well, Arorangi seems to have come down with a cold. I reckon she'll be able to tough it out. We've given her medicine and made sure she's nice and cosy. This cold weather's made our hands full with all the sick critters around here.

**Date: 10/16/05**
Arorangi is sick again. I think it's the same thing as from last year.

**Date: 12/22/06**
Our resident ball of feathers is sick again, poor thing.

**Date: 12/04/07**
Arorangi seems to be getting ill around this time every year. That’s just what comes with age, I guess.  

**Date: 02/18/08**
Arorangi usually gets back on her feet at around this time, but she’s not recovering. We’re moving her to our on-site medical bay. The bay is constantly air-conditioned and we can easily monitor her status. Obviously, we can’t try and do anything beyond just giving her medicine and keeping her warm because blood transplants and the like are impossible. We just have to hope that it doesn’t get to the point where intensive care is necessary. 

**Date: 02/21/08**
I’m worried about Daniel. He’s spending a lot of time with Arorangi. Normally that’d be fine, but he’s not sleeping as much as he should and as far as I can tell, he hasn’t gone home once. I’m going to stop by at some point and talk to him.

**Date: 03/09/08**
We’ve had to go and put Arorangi down.

She had a good run, she was probably around 208 at the time and she saw all the best life had to offer. Daniel found her one morning in a very bad shape called the rest of us in. At least she went out with dignity. We got a vet out here with all of the equipment and we even gave her some almond treats before she had to go, not that she was able to eat any of them.
The important thing is that she was peaceful. And I think having us, her caretakers and friends there with her, put her at ease.

She was a good old bird. We’ll miss you, Arorangi.
