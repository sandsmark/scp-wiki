Cue [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidAttenborough David Attenborough]:
And here we have a prime specimen of the great [[[SCP-075|corrosive snail]]] finishing off its latest kill in the lush wetlands of its native homeworld. This balmy area sees as much as 11 cm of rain per year, and the corrosive snail has evolved to make the most of the prey this bounty attracts. Its powerful digestive acid dissolves all edible material into base chemicals for easy consumption, even the bones; what is not metabolized immediately is compressed and stored within the shell. When the floodwaters recede and the humidity once again drops below 1%, the snail will return to dormancy, living off these copious reserves while patiently waiting for clouds to once again eclipse the blistering twin suns and summon a new feast.

Its kind of weird, working on the aerial view made me realize both how small and how freaking huge [[[SCP-1585]]] is. It'd be hard to get lost on it, but there's plenty of room for a whole bunch of critters. Its bigger than some of the inhabited islands of Micronesia.

Keep practicing, freaky sinkhole in a swamp with unknown motives. You'll get it right eventually.

I freely admit this one stumped me for a while. On top of the hard-to-pin-down effect, I didn't want to just crib off the awesome page image. I also wanted to do something with its current status, where now it's settling for trying to replicate animals. Think this does the job of capturing the idea, but I might have to revisit this scip at some point.

With this one I tried a technique I'd been wanting to test drive for a while; started out mocking up the hallway, lighting, and the shoggoth with basic 3d shapes and some textures in Blender, and did a quick and dirty render to use as the base for the painting. Not much of that ended up in the final image, but it did help plan out the screwy fisheye perspective I needed for this one, and being able to play with the lighting in advance saved some time on the palette mixing side. Not a game changer, but a nice tool to have.

Still want to know if I screwed up the Russian on that sign or not. That's the sort of thing that bothers me and I only sort-of read that particular language. X3

Inspired by the brilliant madness that is [[[pretty-magic-gaiden-mecha-tokyo-mon-demon-ninja-sailor-clef | Pretty Magic Gaiden Mecha Tokyo-Mon Demon Ninja Sailor Clef]]]

So far we have Mecha-nobody, the black queen, monkey!Bright, Dr. Gerald, [[[SCP-2006-j]]], Kondraki with [[[SCP-682]]] and [[[SCP-408]]], Dr. Gears (I decided he's a cyborg in this 'verse), [[[SCP-040]]], [[[SCP-079 | Able]]], and Pretty Magic Gaiden Mecha Tokyo-Mon Demon Ninja Sailor Clef himself in all his disquieting glory.

Dr. Rights, Dr. Elliot of [[[SCP-2108]]], [[[SCP-777-j]]], [[[zyn-kaiju-butterfly-ninja-master| Zyn: kaiju butterfly ninja master]]] and Griffin Lovecraft Also Mark with his butterflies as a hat Also Riven with his telekill goggles, [[[SCP-2103-J]]], [[[SCP-2337]]], [[[SCP-953]]], Alexei Belitrov, Anderson, Ruiz, [[[SCP-2085|The Black Rabbit Company]]],[[[SCP-2800]]] [[[SCP-2992]]],  and pretty much everybody in the [[[Personnel And Character Dossier]]]

 I'm actively looking for suggestions on who and what else needs to be in the full version: I'm looking to fill up the whole page ala one of those anime posters with everyone that's ever been on the show on them. (Leave suggestions [http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-1281417/scorpion451-s-scp-art#post-2681159 here] if you have them!)
