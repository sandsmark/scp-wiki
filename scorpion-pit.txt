Cue [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidAttenborough David Attenborough]:
And here we have a prime specimen of the great [[[SCP-075|corrosive snail]]] finishing off its latest kill in the lush wetlands of its native homeworld. This balmy area sees as much as 11 cm of rain per year, and the corrosive snail has evolved to make the most of the prey this bounty attracts. Its powerful digestive acid dissolves all edible material into base chemicals for easy consumption, even the bones; what is not metabolized immediately is compressed and stored within the shell. When the floodwaters recede and the humidity once again drops below 1%, the snail will return to dormancy, living off these copious reserves while patiently waiting for clouds to once again eclipse the blistering twin suns and summon a new feast.

Its kind of weird, working on the aerial view made me realize both how small and how freaking huge [[[SCP-1585]]] is. It'd be hard to get lost on it, but there's plenty of room for a whole bunch of critters. Its bigger than some of the inhabited islands of Micronesia.

I freely admit this one stumped me for a while. On top of the hard-to-pin-down effect, I didn't want to just crib off the awesome page image. I also wanted to do something with its current status, where now it's settling for trying to replicate animals.

With this one I tried a technique I'd been wanting to test drive for a while; started out mocking up the hallway, lighting, and the shoggoth with basic 3d shapes and some textures in Blender, and did a quick and dirty render to use as the base for the painting. Not much of that ended up in the final image, but it did help plan out the screwy fisheye perspective I needed for this one, and being able to play with the lighting in advance saved some time on the palette mixing side. Not a game changer, but a nice tool to have.

Still want to know if I screwed up the Russian on that sign or not. That's the sort of thing that bothers me and I only sort-of read that particular language. X3
