**Item #:** SCP-1825

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1825 is to be contained in a 10 m x 10 m x 3 m room composed of reinforced steel. Testing with SCP-1825 is recommended to take place inside a 10 m x 34 m x 3 m rectangular room, and must be authorized by at least two Level 3 personnel. SCP-1825 is only allowed to be removed from storage for testing purposes, and is not to be activated outside, or inside a spherical room (see Addendum-1825-01-A).

**Description:** SCP-1825 is a pinball machine measuring two meters in height, half a meter in width, and one point seven meters in length. SCP-1825 features an empty playing field, with two flippers on the bottom, and a hatch for a ball to enter at the top, a scoreboard, and a plunger.

When SCP-1825 is activated, all objects and persons in the room are unable to move. All subjects report being paralyzed and restrained from below the waist. Subjects who activate SCP-1825, designated as SCP-1825-1, are not affected, and are allowed to move freely. When SCP-1825s plunger is pulled, the hatch will release a metal ball aimed towards the left flipper. Once the ball makes contact with the flipper, the ball creates a proxy in the room whose movement is directly tied to how the ball moves on SCP-1825s playing field. When this proxy hits a wall, subject, or object in the room, the item hit will be damaged from the collision while remaining in the same position from the time of activation. When the proxy hits a subject, [REDACTED], which results in the subject’s upper half disconnecting from their waist, while their lower half remains supported by SCP-1825. Objects unaffected from the proxy are SCP-1825, SCP-1825-1, and any objects and persons entering the room after activation.

The weight and density of the proxy created from SCP-1825 has been observed to increase with the number on the scoreboard, which allows the ball to start at an estimated one kg per square meter, and theoretically increase to 999,999,999 kg per cubic meter when the scoreboard has reached its limit. Due to SCP-1825 providing only one ball, this has yet to be achieved. Currently, the highest recorded score is 30,232,450 <see test log-1825-01-11>. When the ball returns to the drain, everything that collided with the proxy ceases to be supported by SCP-1825, and collapses.

**Recovery Notes:** SCP-1825 was found after an incident on January 9th, 20██, where an abandoned arcade game factory in ███████ collapsed. One cadaver was found in the area, ███████ ████, a vagrant presumably seeking shelter inside the factory. It is assumed that ███████ ████ activated SCP-1825, and died from the debris created from leveling the building. SCP-1825 was found in the wreckage, shielded from the debris by several steel girders.
