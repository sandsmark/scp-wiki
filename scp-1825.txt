**Item #:** SCP-1825

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1825 is to remain off, and is to be contained in a standard 10m x 10m x 3m room composed of reinforced steel. Testing with SCP-1825 is recommended to take place inside a 10m x 34m x 3m rectangular room, and must be authorized by at least two (2) Level 3 personnel. SCP-1825 is only allowed to be removed from storage for testing purposes, and is never to be activated outside, or inside a spherical room (see Addendum-1825-01-B).

**Description:** SCP-1825 is a pinball machine measuring two (2) meters in height, half (0.5) a meter in width, and one point seven (1.7) meters in length. SCP-1825 features an empty playing field, with two flippers on the bottom, and a hatch for a ball to enter at the top, a scoreboard, and a plunger.

When SCP-1825 is activated, all objects and persons in the room are unable to move. All subjects report being restrained from below the waist, and unable to move their legs. This instance extends to SCP-1825 as well, but the subject who activated SCP-1825 (hereby referred to as SCP-1825-1) is allowed to move freely. When SCP-1825-1 pulls the plunger, the hatch releases a metal ball aimed towards the left flipper. Once the ball makes contact with the flipper, the ball creates a proxy in the room, whose movement is linked to how the ball moves on the playing field. When the proxy hits a wall, person, or object in the room, the item will be damaged from the collision while remaining in the same area and position from the time of activation. When the proxy hits a subject, [DATA EXPUNGED], which results in the subject’s upper half disconnecting from their waist, while their lower half remains supported by SCP-1825.

[[/div]]

Objects unaffected from the proxy are SCP-1825, SCP-1825-1, and any objects and persons entering the room after activation. The weight and density of the proxy created from SCP-1825 has been observed to increase with the number on the scoreboard, which allows the ball to start at an estimated one (1) kg per square meter, and theoretically increase to 999,999,999 kg per cubed meter when the scoreboard has reached its limit. This has yet to be achieved by any player due to SCP-1825 providing only one ball, although, the highest recorded score is 30,232,450 <see test log-1825-01-A-11 and test log-1825-01-A-12>. When the ball goes into the drain, everything that collided with the proxy ceases to be supported by SCP-1825, and collapses.

**Recovery Notes:** SCP-1825 was found after an incident on January 9th, 20██, where an abandoned arcade game factory in ███████ collapsed. One body was found in the area, ███████ ████, a homeless man who was presumably seeking shelter inside the factory. It is assumed that ███████ ████ found SCP-1825, turned it on, and died from the debris created from leveling the building. SCP-1825 was found intact, shielded from the debris by several steel girders.

>
> **__Test Number:__** 1
> **Subject:** D-17472
> **Time:** February 2nd, 20██, 7:00 AM
> **Test:** place SCP-1825 inside a empty 10m x 34m x 3m room and use SCP-1825 normally.
> **Result:** Banging could be heard against the walls whenever D-17472 had the ball hit the side of the playing field. Test was otherwise uneventful.
>


>
> **__Test Number:__** 2
> **Subject:** D-17472
> **Time:** February 2nd, 20██, 7:14 AM
> **Test:** SCP-1825 is to be used inside the previous room, with a large table placed in the center.
> **Result:** When D-17472 then began to hit the space approximately located to the table on the playing field, SCP-1825 interpreted the table as a bumper. As D-17472 hit the table, the proxy increased in density, and eventually made large dents in the walls. Once the table was hit for the second time, the table was damaged, reaching a score of (ten) 10 before collision. Once the ball fell into the drain, the table immediately collapsed.
>


>
> **__Test Number:__** 3
> **Subject:** D-17472 and D-17473
> **Time:** February 2nd, 20██, 8:09 AM
> **Test:** SCP-1825 is used inside the room with an additional D-class inside (D-17473).
> **Result:** D-17473 immediately expressed discomfort once SCP-1825 was activated, reporting an inability to move his legs. After each collision, the score increased by ten (10) points. When hit for the fourth time, reaching a score of 30 beforehand, D-17473 [DATA EXPUNGED] his torso disconnected from the lower half of his body, and landed on the floor while the lower half of his body was still propped up. D-17472 immediately let go of SCP-1825, and backed away. When the ball went down the drain, D-17473's lower half was released, and fell to the ground.

> **__Test Number:__** 4
> **Subjects:** D-17493
> **Time:** February 2nd, 20██, 9:30 PM
> **Test:** Activate SCP-1825 in a rectangular room that measures 10m x 34m x 3m, with one hole in the floor, measuring two (2) meters in diameter. D-17493 is to use SCP-1825 normally.
> **Result:** Once the proxy hit the hole, SCP-1825 interpreted it as a Kickout hole the scoreboard gained fifty (50) points. The proxy was then ejected towards the wall at a speed of approximately forty five (45) miles per hour. A large hole in the wall was left after the collision, measuring five (5) meters in diameter. The test was terminated immediately afterwards.

>
> **__Test Number:__** 5
> **Subject:** D-17472
> **Time:** February 2nd, 20██, 9:40 AM
> **Test:** SCP-1825 is used inside a 11 m x 11 m x 4 m room. Walls are equipped with motion sensors to check for any distortion in SCP-1825s proxy.
> **Result:** When activated, SCP-1825 emitted a series of noises commonly heard from a standard pinball machine before allowing the ball to be deployed. When hit, the proxy was distorted into the shape of an oval, causing the ball inside SCP-1825 to curve away from its usual projection.
>


>
> **__Test Number:__** 6
> **Subject:** D-17472
> **Time:** February 2nd, 20██, 9:50 AM
> **Test:** SCP-1825 is used inside a three-walled room with each wall measuring 11 meters, and a height of 4 meters. Walls are equipped with motion sensors to check for any distortion in SCP-1825s proxy.
> **Result:** when activated, SCP-1825 emitted a series of noises <see test log-1825-01-A-4>. Afterwards, D-17472 was able to use SCP-1825, however, when in use, the proxy seems to vary in width as it moves up and down the playing field.
>


>
> **__Test Number:__** 7
> **Subject:** D-17472
> **Time:** February 2nd, 20██, 10:00 AM
> **Test:** SCP-1825 is used inside a cylindrical room with a diameter measuring 11 meters, and a height of 4 meters. Walls are equipped with motion sensors to check for any distortion in SCP-1825s proxy.
> **Result:** when activated, SCP-1825 emitted an identical series of noises like in test four and five, and D-17472 was able to use SCP-1825, however, the balls course has become unpredictable, and often bounces to hit the glass.
>


>
> **__Test Number:__** 8
> **Subject:**D-17472
> **Time:** February 2nd, 20██, 10:10 AM
> **Test:** Use SCP-1825 in a spherical room that has a diameter of twelve (12) meters. Walls are equipped with motion sensors to check for any distortion in SCP-1825s proxy.
> **Result:** When activated, SCP-1825 emitted a series of pings before letting D-17472 pull the plunger, although louder and longer than those observed in tests 4, 5, and 6.When the ball hit the flipper, the room immediately broke off from the rest of the building, and launched itself northwest for approximately 500 meters outside. The room fell three stories once brought outside, and returned to the building. The ball stopped when it lightly hit the side of the site, leaving minimal damage to the first floor. When the inside of the room was examined, blood covered approximately 30% of the interior. SCP-1825 was found on its side, with the left hind leg bent from D-17472 colliding with it, and the words "tilt" displayed across its score board. Aside from this, SCP-1825 was otherwise undamaged. Collateral damage includes one (1) empty office, part of a hallway, one (1) janitorial closet and two (2) bathrooms, plus one D-class personel.
> **Notes:** //SCP-1825 needs to be cleaned of blood, have its leg fixed, and moved to its original containment immediately. It appears that when placed inside a spherical room, SCP-1825 cannot identify the room as a playing field, so in an attempt to start the game, SCP-1825 interprets its surroundings into something it can work with.//

> **__Test Number:__** 9
> **Subjects:** D-17474-17495 (twenty one D-Class personnel)
> **Time:** February 2nd, 20██, 4:02 PM
> **Test:** Activate SCP-1825 in a rectangular room that measures 10m x 34m x 3m. Let eighteen D-class personnel in the same room during activation. D-17493 is to simply activate SCP-1825, and is told not pull the plunger. One minute after activation, D-17494 and D-17495 are told to go inside and walk around.
> **Result:** D-17474-17492 were prevented from moving as expected. When D-17494 and D-17495 were told to go inside, they were allowed to move freely. When D-17493 and D-17495 were instructed to try and move SCP-1825, D-17493 through 17495 were unsuccessful. Once SCP-1825 was turned off, D-17493 through 17495 were able to lift SCP-1825.
> **Notes:** //Using SCP-1825 as a means of containment for D-class personnel has been considered, and denied due to obvious destructive properties SCP-1825 possesses. This test would also explain how SCP-1825 remained intact during test number seven.//

>
> **__Test Number:__** 11
> **Subject:**D-17493
> **Time:** February 3rd, 20██, 11:25 AM
> **Test:** Keep SCP-1825 in the same rectangular room. Tell D-17493 to line the entire room with the given furniture so it blocks the ball from going inside the drain.
> **Result:** as soon as D-17493 hit the ball with the plunger, the ball kept bouncing around inside the ring of furniture. The ball has become trapped in an endless loop, and presumably refuses to turn off until the ball returns to the drain. 
>


>
> **__Test Number:__** 12
> **Subject:** D-17482 (Chosen for her past job as a mechanic)
> **Time:** February 3rd, 20██, 11:34 AM
> **Test:** Give D-17482 a set of tools, and tell her to try and remove the glass. Once done, D-17482 is asked to try and touch the furniture from SCP-1825, and put the ball back in the drain. 
> **Result:** D-17482 successfully removed the glass, and confirmed that she could feel the furniture, although no further damage was taken from this action. When the ball was lifted up, the proxy burst through the ceiling. D-17482 panicked, and shoved the ball into the drain, which created a large hole in the area. When the game was ended, the score was 30,232,450, and has been recorded as the high score by SCP-1825.
> **Notes:** //These results explains that the ball is what causes damage, not the machine. This would open up a possibility for military use, but since its the only one, it's best if we didn't use SCP-1825 in a situation where it could be damaged further.//
> //Dr. T██//

>
> **__Test Number:__** 14
> **Subject:** D-17482 (Chosen for her experience with SCP-1825)
> **Time:** February 3rd, 20██, 1:44 PM
> **Test:** SCP-1825 is to be outside with a truck placed 25 meters in front of it. D-17482 is asked to take the ball out before hitting it with the flipper, and feel around for an object shaped like a truck in SCP-1825’s playing field. If she finds it, D-17482 is then tasked to hit it with the ball.
> **Result:** [TEST ABORTED]
> **Notes:** //Since there's the high probability that SCP-1825 would not comprehend an outside playing field, and turn [REDACTED] into the pinball, I stopped the test. I recommend that we cease further testing with SCP-1825, and have it remain in storage until further notice.//

**Addendum 1825-01-B:**
//Dr. T██s statements have been noted. Tests held inside a spherical room or outside involving SCP-1825 will be denied.//
