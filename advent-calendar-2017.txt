It was two years ago that I did [[[advent-calendar-2015|Randomini Continues Talking Despite The Best Efforts Of Almost Everyone He Knows: Advent Calendar Edition v2015]]]. This year I am doing it again, because my mouth is good, and my words are great, and I like to talk. So I am doing recordings for a bunch of people this year too.

**SO.**

Every day this month until Christmas, I'll do a reading of a tale [http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-4390862/christmas-advent-calendar-readings-v2017 as nominated in this thread]. What will happen on Christmas??? It is a mystery.
