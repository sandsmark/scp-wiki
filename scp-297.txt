**Item #:** SCP-297

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-297 is to be kept in a standard lockbox at Site 19's High Value Item Storage Facility. Standard positive-action defenses (explosive, chemical, biological, and memetic) are to be in place at all times, according to standard operating procedure. Personnel wishing to utilize SCP-297 for experimental or field purposes must fill out a Form-32 and submit it to the head of Research and Containment.

**Description:** SCP-297 is a transparent plastic vibrator, approximately 30cm in length, 5cm in width. X-ray examination has determined that the internal structure has been heavily altered, and that the standard 12v power supply has been converted into what appears to be a micronized nuclear reactor.

In addition, the standard power/intensity controls have been altered from the normal on/off switch with secondary intensity dial, to a single five-stage selector switch. The bottom four intensity levels (off, low, medium, high) appear to be within normal parameters for such a device, and can be used safely for such purposes if so desired.

When turned to the highest intensity setting (labeled "suicide"), SCP-297 immediately reaches vibration intensities of over 200,000 kHz, swiftly rising in intensity and emitting an ultrasonic tone described by Kain Pathos Crow as, "excruciating." If the upper portion of the device is touched to any solid material, SCP-297 will change frequency to one that causes a positive harmonic feedback loop in the object, causing the object to lose cohesion within sixty seconds. Obviously, this would have catastrophic results if the device were being used for its originally intended purpose at the time. 

Experimentation has determined that SCP-297 is capable of affecting approximately one cubic meter of material at a time, with the effective radius varying based on the density and harmonic properties of the material.

**Addendum: Circumstances of Retrieval** SCP-297 was retrieved from the third basement of the parking structure of a thirty-story apartment building in Los Angeles, California, on ██-██-████. According to eyewitnesses, the device bored a vertical hole through the entire building's north-western corner, starting from the 30th floor and proceeding, floor by floor, through the entire structure, until a quick-witted maintenance personnel neutralized the device by pressing the "off" button. All witnesses were detained and administered a Class A Amnesiac, and the device was retrieved by SCP Foundation personnel. A large quantity of liquified human DNA (later identified as female) was found on the thirtieth floor, at the upper limit of the damage.
