**Item #:** SCP-386

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:**

No entry to the containment area is allowed without approval from Site Command.  Pressure levels inside containment area are to be monitored at all times.  Should pressure begin to reach the failure level for any materials currently used in containment, the containment area is to be opened and SCP-386 units removed until pressure reaches acceptable levels.  SCP-386 removed in this manner is to be re-contained in alternate containment areas, or disposed of by any means adopted under Disposal Strategy 386D.  

Standard High Pressure Materials protocols are to be observed by all personnel working in or around the containment area.  Emergency blast doors and shields are to be installed in any halls, ventilation, or plumbing systems connecting to the containment area or immediately surrounding areas.  All blast shielding is to be connected to the pressure monitoring systems.  In the event of a breach, the containment area and all surrounding areas will be automatically sealed.

The containment area is to be cleaned and repaired at twice-yearly intervals.  Anything exiting the containment area must be scanned for SCP-386 spores.
