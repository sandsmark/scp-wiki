[[/div]]
**Item #:** SCP-386

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:**

No entry to the containment area is allowed without approval from Site Command.  Pressure levels inside containment area are to be monitored at all times.  Should pressure begin to reach the failure level for any materials currently used in containment, the containment area is to be opened and SCP-386 units removed until pressure reaches acceptable levels.  SCP-386 removed in this manner is to be re-contained in alternate containment areas, or disposed of by any means adopted under Disposal Strategy 386D.  

Standard High Pressure Materials protocols are to be observed by all personnel working in or around the containment area.  Emergency blast doors and shields are to be installed in any halls, ventilation, or plumbing systems connecting to the containment area or immediately surrounding areas.  All blast shielding is to be connected to the pressure monitoring systems.  In the event of a breach, the containment area and all surrounding areas will be automatically sealed.

The containment area is to be cleaned and repaired at twice-yearly intervals.  Anything exiting the containment area must be scanned for SCP-386 spores.  Any personnel entering into or working near the containment area must be in full haz-mat gear with self-contained atmosphere.

**Description:**

SCP-386 is a form of mushroom that appears to have highly regenerative processes, and is indestructible by any means available.  Single units of SCP-386 grow from individual spores.  These spores grow and reach maturity within four days.  Spores have been observed to grow without water, sunlight, any form of nutrients, and in a vacuum.  SCP-386 produces no hyphae, and the means by which is gathers the energy for growth is unknown.  A form of mild acid (5 ph) appears to be secreted in small quantities by the cap, identification of which has been inconclusive.

All attempts to destroy, damages, or take samples from SCP-386 have been failures.  Units of SCP-386 have a texture and weight similar to sponge, but are impossible to cut, puncture, crush, burn, grind or otherwise physically damage.  Units always return to their original dimensions as soon as they are left alone.  SCP-386 units can be compressed to 1/10 their original size, beyond which compression appears impossible.

SCP-386 emits between 10 to 50 spores every ten days after reaching maturity.  Fully grown SCP-386 do not appear to age or rot, with some specimens still appearing exactly the same despite existing for over 122 years.  Containment is difficult due to the constant reproduction, causing the containment area to be under extreme pressure due to the volume of SCP-386 contained inside.  Outbreaks of SCP-386 can over-run areas in very short periods of time, and the build up of spores and acidic secretions can render the area extremely hazardous to life.

One of the dangers of SCP-386 arises from complications arising from the inhalation of spores.  These will grow and reproduce inside the lungs, causing suffocation, internal hemorrhaging, and death.  The same is true of accidental ingestion of spores, and their subsequent reproduction inside the digestive system.  No reported incidents of spore introduction to the blood stream have arisen, however it is assumed that such infection would result in extreme trauma and death, depending on the location of infection.

**Notes on recovery:**

SCP-386 was originally recovered after reports surfaced from a farm in ██████, Michigan about a cattle mutilation.  It was stated that it appeared the cow had exploded from the inside, and was covered with an unknown form of mushroom.  Responding Agents found a small hill of mushrooms over four feet in height, which had become a small public special.  After observation of the unique properties of SCP-386, The Foundation initiated full area lock-down, and recovered all units and spores of SCP-386 with the cover story of an outbreak of highly toxic fungus from a forging location.

Periodic outbreaks of SCP-386 are not uncommon, and full containment is difficult due to the small size and high mobility of spores.
