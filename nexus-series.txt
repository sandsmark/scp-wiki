[[size 200%]]**What Is A Nexus**[[/size]]
^^[[size 130%]]//Never even heard of it before//[[/size]]^^

A Nexus (plural: Nexuses[[footnote]]For those of you who think it's Nexii, please see the discussion thread[[/footnote]]) is an area/zone that is actively anomalous, and supports a permanent community. Imagine a city like New York, except that perhaps the city never sees the Sun, or people sometimes turn into animals, and that's perfectly normal for them.

Normally, the Foundation/GOIs would classify these places as SCPs and try to get everyone out and lock the place down. Unfortunately, sometimes that isn't always possible or feasible. Hence, they designate those places as a Nexus. This means that these areas are recognised as places of anomalous activity and left be, albeit under supervision from a GOI or government. They are also hidden from the public, and all evidence of its existence hidden.

There are also larger versions Nexuses, known as Free Ports. These area are inherently anomalous, often being disconnected from the main world. They act as safe zones where the Veil is not required, as everyone who enters a Free Port, knows about the anomalous. Free Ports are usually recognised as sovereign states and are self-managed, albeit with some intervention from federal or international agencies.

[[size 200%]]**Characteristics of a Nexus**[[/size]]
^^[[size 130%]]//The foundations of an idea//[[/size]]^^

[[size 150%]]**Low Population**[[/size]]
Most Nexuses have very low population numbers, with the highest being 30,000[[footnote]]An exception would be Nx-03, Hy-Brasil with a former population of just over a 100,000[[/footnote]]. A large population would often mean news of the Nexus would be spread around much more.It's also an added bonus to the Foundation, which helps them maintain the Veil easily.

[[size 150%]]**Nexus Confines**[[/size]]
A Nexus's anomalies only occur within the confines of the Nexus (or in certain cases, other Nexuses). For example, you couldn't force the Goatman from Sloth's Pit to exit the confines of the Nexus: the act would simply make him a normal goat after a while. What happens in the Nexus, stays in the Nexus.

[[size 150%]]**Thematic Influence**[[/size]]
Each Nexus has its central theme that encompasses the entire idea of the anomaly in the Nexus.They can exist anywhere in the world, so long as they have around ~25 people at least, and should not match the any real-world location. Besides that, you're free to do whatever you want. If you want a Nexus that rains salmon, go ahead[[footnote]]Someone's already done that idea, unfortunately[[/footnote]].

[[size 150%]]**Nexus Area Classes**[[/size]]

[[size 130%]]**##blue|Briar##**[[/size]]
Name derived from the old Briar Patch from Song of the South. A few local curiosities, higher frequency for extranormal events and anomalous objects. Requires little to no cover-up by the Foundation.
@@@@
[[size 130%]]**##green|Asphodel##**[[/size]]
Name derived from the Fields of Asphodel, the incredibly mediocre afterlife in Greek Mythology. Civilians will get the feeling that something's off about this place, higher frequency for extranormal events and anomalous objects. Requires some cover-up by the Foundation.
@@@@
[[size 130%]]**##FFDD00|Camelot##**[[/size]]
Name derived from the King Arthur Legends. Anomalous activity is a fairly integral part of the town. Foundation has to perform cover-ups regularly, as well as make it a bit more difficult for civilians to find by taking it off maps and such. Containment Facilities may be needed on a case-by-case basis.
@@@@
[[size 130%]]**##orange|Shangri-La##**[[/size]]
Name derived from James Hilton's Lost Horizon novel. Hotbed of anomalous activity. Active attempts to stop civilians. The Foundation rolls with the anomalous as it comes. Containment facility required.
@@@@
[[size 130%]]**##red|Dunwich##**[[/size]]
Thank you H.P. Lovecraft. The entire place is practically anomalous. The Nexus is almost entirely cut off from the non-anomalous world. Special measures may be required to keep personnel safe. Containment facility required.
@@@@
[[size 130%]]**##purple|Free Port##**[[/size]]
Anomalous hubs of commerce and living. These communities are openly aware of the anomalous and actively practice it. These hubs are protected by national/international law, and forbid Foundation intervention. Policing of the Nexus is done though its own agencies. These Nexuses can only be accessed through anomalous means[[footnote]]Think Diagon Alley from Harry Potter. [[/footnote]].
