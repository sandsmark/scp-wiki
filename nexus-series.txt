+ Operational Information on Nexuses

[[collapsible show="+Overview of Nexuses"]]

* A Nexus is a concentrated area of Anomalous Activity.
* A Nexus can usually be defined with three criteria:
@@@@ 1) Low population: Only one Nexus in existence has a population exceeding 100,000, and the second-largest beyond that only has 30,000.
@@@@ 2) The inability for anomalies from the area to exist outside of the given area, or at least, have difficulty maintaining existence. Let's say that you were to take a Hodag out of Sloth's Pit, Wisconsin. It would survive for a few weeks, but certain circumstances- in this case, the fact that its sole source of food, a particular type of bush, only grows in the Sloth's Pit nexus zone- means that it either gets brought back or it "fails" being an anomaly.
@@@@ 3) Some sort of central idea or theme to the area.
* A Nexus can exist anywhere on Earth, so long as it has a human population of at least 27 individuals. There are Nexuses in the US, Canada, China, England, Japan, Spain, Russia, Timbuktu...
* Nexuses are so numerous to the point where they took up too many SCP spaces, so they gave them their own classification.
* (meta) The name of the Nexus should not match the name of an IRL place.
* Populations don't notice or don't care.
* No rules. If it's weird, it's gonna happen.

[[collapsible show="+Area Classes"]]

Nexus Area Classes are determined using a combination of A) how blatant and obvious the Nexus is and B) how likely civilians are to encounter it. The more effort that the Foundation has to put in to prevent an information breach, the higher the Class.

* **Briar**- Name derived from the old Briar Patch from Song of the South. A few local curiosities, higher frequency for extranormal events and anomalous objects. Requires little to no cover-up by the Foundation.
@@@@
* **Asphodel**- Name derived from the Fields of Asphodel, the incredibly mediocre afterlife in Greek Mythology. Civilians will get the feeling that something's off about this place, higher frequency for extranormal events and anomalous objects. Requires some cover-up by the Foundation.
@@@@
* **Camelot**- Name derived from the King Arthur Legends. Anomalous activity is a fairly integral part of the town. Foundation has to perform cover-ups regularly, as well as make it a bit more difficult for civilians to find by taking it off maps and such. Containment Facilities may be needed on a case-by-case basis.
@@@@
* **Shangri-La**- Name derived from James Hilton's Lost Horizon novel. Hotbed of anomalous activity. Active attempts to stop civilians. The Foundation rolls with the anomalous as it comes. Containment facility required.
@@@@
* **Dunwich**- Thank you H.P. Lovecraft. The entire place is practically anomalous. The Nexus is almost entirely cut off from the non-anomalous world. Special measures may be required to keep personnel safe. Containment facility required.
