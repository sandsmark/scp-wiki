**Item #:** SCP-1171

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1171 is currently occupied by Dr. ██████, who has established a false identity as an technical writer.  A tall wall has been erected around the backyard, and all anomalous windows visible from the front of the house have been fitted with shutters.  For security, several agents have moved in under the guise of lodgers.

**Description:** SCP-1171 is a two-story house in ██████, Queensland, Australia.  It was built in 1958, and has been owned by several families, most of whom reported no unusual activity.  

The anomalous properties of SCP-1171 manifest on various windows of the house.  Regardless of relative humidity, a layer of condensation is continuously formed on the windowpanes.  The source of this moisture is as yet unknown.

An entity (hereby referred to as SCP-1171-1) communicates by writing in the condensation, as though it were running an appendage along the surface of the window.  No biological traces have been discovered on the windows that can be attributed to SCP-1171-1.

SCP-1171-1 is apparently an inhabitant of another world, calling itself Beauremont.  It claims not to be human, and is actively hostile to humanity.  It believes the Foundation to be operated by similar entities.  Please see Interview Logs SCP-1171-1-3 to SCP-1171-1-14.

The most recent owner, John Wertham, complained about ghosts, prompting investigation by civil authorities, and eventually Foundation agents.  Following the investigation, the house was purchased through a front organization, and Mr. Wertham's memories altered.

> **Dr. ██████:** "I don't know.  I thought you were doing it."
> 
> **SCP-1171-1:** "IT'S GOOD TO HAVE SOMEONE INTELLIGENT TO TALK TO."  An oval with five dots and a curved line appears.  Two dots were below the line, one above it, and two on the left.  It is assessed that this is SCP-1171-1's version of a "smiley face."
> 
> **Dr. ██████:** "Is there no one else there?"
> 
> **SCP-1171-1:** "AH, MOSTLY JUST A BUNCH OF GAMETES AND CARBON-LOVERS.  CAN'T HARDLY STAND ANY OF THAT POLITICALLY CORRECT CRAP."

> 
> **SCP-1171-1:** "OH, THEY'RE THE WORST.  I MEAN, DON'T GET ME WRONG, I'M NOT RACIST OR ANYTHING.  SOME OF MY BEST FRIENDS ARE HUMAN.  BUT IF THEY'RE AS GOOD AS US, WHY DO THEY NEED SKIN?  AM I RIGHT?"
> 
> **Dr. ██████:** "I suppose so.  Say, what do you look like?"
> 
> **SCP-1171-1:** "OH, PRETTY AVERAGE.  SEVEN TENDRILS TALL.  BROWN CARAPACE.  GREEN BIOLUMINESCENCE.  BLUE EYES.  YOU?"

> **Dr. ██████:** "I'm sorry to hear that."
> 
> **SCP-1171-1:** "IT'S OKAY.  IT JUST HURTS.  I KNOW I'M BETTER THAN ANY AIR-SUCKING SACK OF PROTOPLASM.  I WORK HARD, YOU KNOW?"
> 
> **Dr. ██████:** "I know."
> 
> **SCP-1171-1:** "THEY COME IN, THEY TAKE OUR JOBS...   I TELL YOU, DOC, ONE OF THESE DAYS THEY'RE GOING TO PUSH US TOO FAR.  NOT THAT I'M SAYING WE SHOULD GET VIOLENT, BUT THAT'S THE NATURAL RESULT IF THINGS KEEP GOING THIS WAY."
> 
> **Dr. ██████:** "I hope it doesn't come to that."
> 
> **SCP-1171-1:** "OH, SURE, NO ONE DOES.  I MEAN, THEY CAN'T HELP BEING WHAT THEY ARE.  BUT THEY KEEP COMING IN.  I MEAN, I DON'T MIND HAVING A FEW AS NEIGHBORS, SO LONG AS THEY MIND THEMSELVES, BUT WOULD YOU WANT YOUR SPAWNSIB TO MARRY ONE?

> **Dr. ██████:** "I suppose not."
