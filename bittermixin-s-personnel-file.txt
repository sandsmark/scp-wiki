[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3199 SCP-3199]: 'Humans, Refuted'. When all was said and done, and I was ready to write my first ever article, I knew I wanted to challenge myself. A Keter humanoid. A Keter humanoid that kills people. How hard could it be, right?

Fucking. That's how hard.

I found the image on the [https://www.reddit.com/r/creepy/ r/creepy subreddit], having made the decision to scour the web for as long as I could until I found something skip-worthy. I stumbled upon it within a few minutes, and knew it would be perfect. [https://www.artstation.com/artist/ryan Ryan Van Dongen], the original artist, had actually wanted a creature on the wiki for some time- and even did various edits to the picture upon my request. In fact, he went as far as to [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh4ZscKHGrs&t=1s change the title of his speedpaint] to include 'SCP-3199'. Very cool guy, who you should definitely check out.

My mind was drawn to one idea, one primary focus- what would make something hard to contain? We've had old men who slide through walls, indestructible lizards, and as I thought and thought it felt as if the well of concepts had run dry. It was on one particular bus ride that it came to me- use the source material. It's a man-chicken. Chickens lay eggs. And everything clicked together in this incredible jigsaw that just blew my mind back into my fucking face. 

So I started writing. I was cocky, as I'm sure many authors are, and pretty much thought I was done with draft numero uno. Sure, I thought, maybe there'd be some spelling errors or bad terminology, but this was my magnum fucking opus. The crème de la crème. Until, that is, //the critters// approached the horizon. Cape billowing in the wind. And obliterated my article with feedback so brutally good it turned me inside out with embarrassment.

To any new or nervous people who happen to read this: it's okay. Because it improved. It got better. I still get a weird feeling in my stomach whenever I get critted, because everyone wants to be the victim. But being able to grit your teeth and bare it is what will inevitably make you succeed.

I posted. I didn't actually dare to look at the page for the following //three days//, deciding that I wasn't going to sit back and watch the votes decline. If it sinks, it sinks, and I can take that all in with one rip of the band-aid. It was at +30. I've never felt more relieved in my life.

jk i just like chickens i mean have you SEEN a chicken

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3939 SCP-3939]: 'The World Is My Canvas'. This idea actually came to me one day when I was drawing. I like to scribble down funny little monster concepts, just to practice proportions and whatnot. It was when I decided to make the arms of this new creature end in wispy threads of ink that I knew I wanted to do something with them.

My friend [[*user Watticus]] and I sat for a good hour or so on Skype, where I ran him through the concept of a creature that turns people into paint. He was a great help in developing the more physics-oriented side of it. How would it be achieved? How fast would this entity need to go if in order to not be picked up by the naked eye? It was honestly a lot of fun, and a lot less stressful than my previous attempt.

The original document you see at the end used to be far, //far// longer, but I was advised by [[*user MrWrong]] to tone it down a bit- having an enormous infodump at the end of your skip isn't particularly interesting or fun to read through.

In all honesty, I don't have a lot more to say about this skip in particular, and I'm not even sure how I //feel// about it. I just think it perhaps needed more time, but hindsight is a beautiful thing. Maybe I'll rewrite it some day.

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/bitter-art I draw things sometimes]. Granted, not very often, [[size 80%]]and not very well[[/size]], but draw them I do indeed do I do. Check it out if you're so inclined.

//{{The following documentation was recovered from a computer desk located in ██████, England. That lazy fuck probably just hasn't got out of bed yet. Also, the handwriting is really gross. Looks like an angry crow dipped its feet in ink and tried tap-dancing. Look, just- get on with it.}}//

> 
> **Item #:** SCP-B1773R
> 
> **Object Class:** Safe. I wouldn't want to bump into them in a dark alley. Not because they're dangerous, just because it would be a little weird.
> 
> **Special Containment Procedures:** Just don't give it money. We all know it'll just blow it on Overwatch loot boxes and Pepsi.
> 
> **Description:** Looks dumb as shit. Remember Chunk from The Goonies? Imagine an alternate timeline where he didn't grow up into a slim and well-presented Vin Diesel type, and instead kept the same wank haircut and baby face.
>  
> Spends 98% of its time on the computer watching Spongebob meme comps and decade-old let's plays. Prefers drawing with dark pencils and ballpoint pen, rarely uses colour. Drinks far too many fizzy drinks, excessively fixes its hair yet has the dress sense of a brick, and generally looks confused and disoriented even when its not really doing anything.
> 
> Also has two axolotl pets. Their names are Nemo and Aztec.
> 
> Any veterans within a 300 mile radius of SCP-B1773R will most likely have seen their latest draft via the PM's. This anomalous effect has no known limit, so buckle up, bucko. Patience is a distant relic in the eyes of this Stephen King monster.
