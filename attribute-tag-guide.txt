title:Attribute Tag Guide
parent:tag-guide
> This page is intended as a guide to attribute tags, or secondary tags on SCP articles. When choosing tags for an article, keep in mind that you want to keep the list as short as possible; the goal should be to choose tags that are already being used, rather than create a new one. If staff should determine that a new tag is necessary, they can always retroactively tag articles as necessary.
> 
> **If you would like to suggest a new tag, please do so in the discussion thread for this page.**
