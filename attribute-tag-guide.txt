title:Attribute Tag Guide
parent:tag-guide
**//This page is a work in progress, and should be treated as such.//**

This page is intended as a guide to attribute tags, or secondary tags on SCP articles. When choosing tags for an article, keep in mind that you want to keep the list as short as possible; the goal should be to choose tags that are already being used, rather than create a new one; if staff should determine that a new tag is necessary, they can always retroactively tag articles as necessary.
