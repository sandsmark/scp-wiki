+ Interesting Characters Workshop Seminar Notes

+++ Seminar run by Dr Bright

+++++ Intro: There is no one way to write an interesting character

* If there was, everyone would write characters like that
* There a many ways to go about it

+++++ Part one: Mary Sues

* Mary Sues are characters that are flawless
* Flawless characters are often boring
* Often it is less about whether the character is boring but more about how this is treated in the story
* Flaws can be imposed on the character by the world around them

+++++ Part two: Conflict

* Characters rarely exist alone
* The easiest way to show who your character is, is by putting them against other characters
* Conflict is a great way for setting tone, showing goals and developing your characters
* The conflict should be natural and have personal stakes to everyone involved

+++++ Part three: NPCs

* All characters should feel like they are alive
* Of course some characters will be NPCs, only existing for a plot purpose
* Overall every character should feel like the protagonist of their own story, with their own quirks, relationships and goals

+++++ Part four: Nonhumans

* There are 2 ways to write a non human character (specifically their thought processes)
 * 1. Portray them as having a human mind, only from a a unique perspective
 * 2. Try to abstract their thought processes as much as possible
* Try to imagine: What could be the goals, interests and speaking patterns of a rock, a dog, a non-carbon based alien or the personified colour green?

+++++ Part five: Representation

* Representing different kinds of people is not only nice for your readers but also a great way to diversify your characters perspectives
* You don't need a reason to include different kinds of people
* You can write any kind of character but should refrain from writing about their perspective if you do not know it
 * Try to find input from relevant authors for such cases

Thank You for Reading! Seminars are run intermittently in #workshop and will be announced ahead of time on many SCP related channels (Including #site19 and the seminar hub).
