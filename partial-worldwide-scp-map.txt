The following is an incomplete map of mainlist SCP recovery locations, Foundation secure Sites and Areas, and other Locations of Interest. Unless otherwise noted, each marker represents the location where the SCP in question was first recovered/identified. The map is kept up-to-date as much as possible, although if you notice a missing entry, feel free to add it.

Tips:

* Click on the satellite view button to switch the map to satellite imagery
* Click on each entry for a link to the relevant wiki article
* Under the view menu, select 'show list' for an alphabetical/numerical list of entries
* Not all anomalies may be visible on the satellite view. If you are unable to locate an SCP at the marked location, assume the satellite data has been censored according to Foundation protocols[[footnote]]Or that I just did the best I could with what was available on the map.[[/footnote]]
