> **FORM 66-Y - STANDARD DREAM REPORT**
> 
> **Personnel:** Dr. ██████████
> 
> **Estimated Degree of Recall:** 60%
> 
> **Anomalous Entity Present?:** Y
> 
> **Likelihood of Actionable Intelligence:** HIGH
> 
> **Description:** SCP-990 is dressed in the same suit, looking the same as ever. I recognize him immediately. He's the clearest element in any dream he visits. His face changes a lot from dream to dream, but this time it's changing from one moment to the next. I attribute it to the high stress of the past couple days.
> 
> He tells me he's going to show me some things. I feel apprehension, and I wonder what burnt out ruin he's going to show me, because that has to be what this is about, right? Our time has come and this is going to be what awaits us. I try to wake up, but I can't do it. And it feels like I'm sitting at the bottom of a pool, and I can't will myself to go to the surface. I don't think I've felt panic like that in a dream before. 
> 
> 990 shakes his head. I can't tell if it's him keeping me here or if it's the dream itself. We've never been able to figure out what kind of control he has. He says, I'm going to guide you, ██████. But I need something of you first. And he points at my left hand. 
> 
> It's a dream, right? Even with all of the things we've encountered in this field, I've never seen anyone harmed in that way. I hold out my hand. 990 nods at me, and he takes something out of his coat. It looks like a blade of some kind, it's got a sharp edge at least. Not a knife. More like something from a lawn mower, or some piece of industrial machinery. Before I have time to ask what's going on, he's brought the blade down through my wrist, lightning fast. I look at my hand, terrified, and I'm sure that it's going to fall off, and blood is going to start spraying any second. 
> 
> But nothing happens.
> 
> I stare in shock for a few seconds. The pain is real, but I'm afraid to move my arm because my hand is going to fall off if I do. 990 looks sympathetic, and he tells me that I can move my hand, it's fine. Then he says that we're out of reach of 001 now, and we can talk. 
> 
> I wiggle my fingers, and they work like they should, but my hand is numb. The feeling is disconcerting. Yet the sensation of panic from earlier is gone. Things feel more like normal now. Except for my hand. 
> 
> He looks at me. He's got my face now. I get the impression that I am someone else now. Feels like a woman, but I'm not certain. Identity shifts a little as we talk. He tells me that he can give me three revelations before 001 finds him again. 
> 
>  Suddenly we're sitting outside, in the night air, under the stars. There are nine moons in the sky. Varying sizes and phases. I'm in a child's body. He's still me. 
> 
> He speaks. Holding up one finger. You are not in your proper place, he says. I ask him what that means. Me, personally? The Foundation? Mankind? He ignores me. 
> 
> He raises a second finger. O5-2 is absolutely correct, and she is disastrously wrong. The reference to specific Foundation personnel is unnerving. I start to speak, but I can tell he's not going to listen. 
> 
> The third finger, the third revelation. He leans in close to me. This is the trickiest one, he tells me. He asks me to commit this one to memory above all others, and so I have for this report. This is the last thing he said to me before I woke up. 
> 
> The primary mover behind what you know as SCP-001, above all other things, is love. 
> 
> That was when I awoke at my work station.
