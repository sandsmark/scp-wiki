**Item #:** SCP-816

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-816 is currently contained to Provisionary Site-██ of its own volition. A containment breach is not considered likely, and any containment breach will likely end without intervention, as SCP-816 requires access to SCP-816-1 in order to survive, and is not capable of moving SCP-816-1. Provisionary Site-██ [Site-P/██] has been established to contain and research SCP-816. Site-P/██ is a home in █████████, Switzerland, and SCP-816 is confined to its basement.

**Description:** SCP-816 is the name given to the collection of microrobots residing in the basement of the house at ██ █████████ Street, █████████, Switzerland. Journals found in the basement indicate that ███████ ████████, a local teacher, originally created SCP-816 in 189█. Inspired by the works of Charles Darwin and Charles Babbage, he designed and built robots capable of reproducing and evolving. The mechanics of reproduction are facilitated by a collection of parts common to all species; however, most species modify the base parts to create specialized parts to fit their ecological niche.

At the core of each SCP-816 is a rudimentary processor which varies little between species. While much less powerful than modern processors, they are still far beyond what should be possible for 1890’s level technology. While, as far as research has determined, no aspect of SCP-816 violates known principles of science, they are still precisely designed to a degree which is not humanly possible.

██ distinct species of SCP-816 have been observed, though many more likely exist. Based on journal records, all species are descended from a single original design. SCP-816 reproduction is similar to biological reproduction, with a few key exceptions: any individual can act as a “male” or “female”; during “intercourse” the designs for both partners are mixed, with infrequent “mutation”, and the data is transferred to the “female”, who then begins searching for parts to assemble the new design.

SCP-816 receives new energy from SCP-816-1, a grandfather clock modified to provide mechanical energy to SCP-816. SCP-816-1 was designed for longevity; however, upon discovery SCP-816-1 had nearly exhausted its energy supply, and as such the SCP-816 research team has rewound SCP-816-1 to continue providing energy. The research team concluded that keeping SCP-816 dependant on a local energy source would aid containment, and that without SCP-816-1, SCP-816 would likely adapt to gain energy in a way that would allow it to expand beyond Site-P/██. The consequences of an expansion of SCP-816 beyond Site-P/██ are unknown, and could be, in a best-case scenario, harmless, to, in a worst-case scenario, an RK-Class Restructuring Scenario.

> //Note from Dr. ████████: If anybody discovers any new species independently, please list them here so we can get the full picture of 816’s development.//
> 
> SCP-816-2 (“Assimilator”): The core of the SCP-816 ecosystem, SCP-816-2 is capable of converting scrap metal and other materials into the basic parts used by all species. SCP-816-2 is roughly the SCP-816 equivalent of an herbivore, and it is the only species which occupies this niche.
> 
> SCP-816-3 (“Hopper”): With its large legs, SCP-816-3 is capable of sudden bursts of speed, allowing it to quickly travel and evade predators.
> 
> SCP-816-4 (“Raptor”): The apex predator of the SCP-816 ecosystem and one of the few species left capable of flight, SCP-816-4 has no natural predators
> 
> SCP-816-5 (“Integrator”): A scavenger, SCP-816-5 uses the various specialized pieces left over from predation; usually in ways that they were not designed for. This innovative behavior is among the hardest aspects of SCP-816 to explain.
