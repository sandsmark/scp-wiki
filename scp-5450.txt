**Description:** SCP-XXXX is a recipe known as shark fin soup, which manifests anomalous properties when produced from sharks within the Shanghai region. Selachians within those areas, now designated SCP-XXXX-1 biologically show no difference to normal sharks other than the presence of lungs. The anomalous property of SCP-XXXX is that upon consumption the subject will become a species of selachian with varying results. Upon taking on the new form, the newly transformed subject will find its way to a body of water via currently unknown means. A small amount of cases have shown the individuals to move their fins in a way similar to walking. Testing has been preemptively denied via the Site Director Jorge Clark as the effects of SCP-XXXX are well documented and apparent.

**Discovery:** SCP-XXXX was discovered when several families went missing in Shanghai followed by several reports of walking sharks online. Witnesses to instances of SCP-XXXX-1 were promptly amnesized and returned. Currently as of 06/07/2019, there is an estimated count of 452 instances of SCP-XXXX-1, making them an endangered species.

**Notes:** On 04/29/2019, Foundation web crawlers flagged an advertisement. a transcription of the advertisement is attached:
