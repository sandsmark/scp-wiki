title:SCP-610-D2
During construction of the perimeter surrounding SCP-610's containment area several Class-D Personnel were infected due to assaults from infected villagers or animals roaming the area in addition to a number of infections as a result of escape attempts and careless behavior. Most of these infections were immediately cleansed with flame units however a small collection of infected were contained in cold storage units which prolonged the inevitable progression of SCP-610's mutative properties. The decision was made to utilize this infected personnel as video relays and dispatch them into nearby sites.
