**Item #:** SCP-1418

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1418 is to be kept in secure storage at the Sector-25 containment facility. Test proposals should be submitted in writing to sector management.

**Description:** SCP-1418 is an ornate ivory liturgical comb consistent with 12^^th^^ century craftsmanship; its anomalous properties become apparent when worn by a human subject. The subject is rapidly altered, physically and biologically, with tissue samples harvested from subjects during medical exploration indicating this process extends down to a genetic level. The process typically takes approximately 1 minute; once complete, the subject can be classified as a Caucasian female who appears to be 25-30 years old. The appearance of the transformed subject closely matches that of the object's previous owner; see Recovery Log 1418.

Once transformed the subject is to all intents and purposes biologically dead. Despite having no measurable vital signs, the subject retains consciousness and can follow physical and mental tests to completion. Tissue analysis confirms the presence of complex long-chain proteins which seem to actuate the subject's nervous, muscular and cardiovascular systems.

Over the next 24 hours following the transformation process, the body of the subject will show accelerated signs of decomposition, undergoing putrefaction approximately 18 hours after the transformation. Insect activity is absent, but necrophilic bacteria on the body of the subject demonstrate a level of activity commensurate with the most virulent strains of //Escherichia coli//. Accordingly, subjects under the influence of SCP-1418 should be considered active biohazards. The user's capacity to move and act progressively degenerates until at 23 hours and 50 minutes from transformation subjects undergo brain death.

Removal of the comb before approximately 22 hours from transformation will result in the reversion of the subject to their former state, with all vital signs returning to normal; this process takes approximately 10 minutes. After 22 hours, damage to the transformed body - whether related to the accelerated decomposition process or otherwise - is not fully reverted, with portions of the user's tissues typically continuing to exhibit necrosis. After the onset of brain death, removal of the comb from the subject fails to initiate reversion of the subject to their former physical condition.

**Recovery Log 1418**

SCP-1418 was recovered with 149 other articles and effects from the estate of the late Lady ████████ , a dowager of some notoriety who had been under Foundation surveillance due to her association with Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd., a high-society concern known to traffick in anomalous objects and which has been classified as a Group of Interest to the Foundation. Lady ████████ 's body was found on the morning of ██/██/19██ ; she was reported to have been dead for 4 weeks when discovered owing to the condition of her body - however, Foundation surveillance agents had recorded a liaison between Lady ████████ and a figure assumed to be a lover the previous evening. Due to Lady ████████ 's high profile and connections to the peerage an official inquest - which failed to record a cause of death - and a public auction of her assets was permitted. All assets were successfully acquired by Foundation agents posing as representatives of various buyers. SCP-1418's properties were discovered only during exhaustive testing of the other recovered items, which proved non-anomalous and which were destroyed.

It remains unclear whether the body identified as Lady ████████ was indeed that of the dowager countess, and if not, at what point the switch was made. Given the object's properties it cannot even be assumed that Lady ████████ was a single individual rather than several parties utilising SCP-1418. It is however noteworthy that the comb was found locked in a desk in the room Lady ████████ died, suggesting the death was not an accidental result of overuse of SCP-1418; given its observed properties in testing a third party would have needed to remove the item from the corpse.

> Dr. Rolfus,
> O5-5 is in agreement with me that your access requests regarding SCP-1418 are excessive and frankly unhealthy. I have in front of me records indicating that you have accessed this item no less than 257 times since recovery, overwhelmingly without either a subject or a fellow researcher present. This would be excusable and indeed commendable had this resulted in a significant body of research and experimentation into the uses and functionality of SCP-1418. It has not. O5-5 supports my conclusion that this is strongly indicative of misuse of Foundation assets. You have produced good work in the past and will continue to do so at Site-60. Effective immediately, you are reassigned to [[[SCP-1447]]].
