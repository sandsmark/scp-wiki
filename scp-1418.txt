**Item #:** SCP-1418

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1418 is to be kept in secure storage at the Sector-25 containment facility. Experiments on human subjects should be carried out under full biocontainment conditions.

**Description:** SCP-1418 is an ornate ivory liturgical comb consistent with 12^^th^^ century craftsmanship; its anomalous properties become apparent when worn by a human subject. The subject is rapidly altered, physically and biologically; tissue samples harvested from subjects during medical exploration indicate this process extends down to a genetic level. The process typically takes approximately 1 minute; once complete, the subject can be classified as a Caucasian female who appears to be 25-30 years old. The appearance of the transformed subject closely matches that of the object's previous owner; see Recovery Log 1418.

Once transformed the subject is for all intents and purposes biologically dead. Despite having no measurable vital signs, the subject retains consciousness and can follow physical and mental tests to completion. Tissue analysis confirms the presence of complex long-chain proteins which appear to actuate the subject's nervous, muscular and cardiovascular systems.

Over the next 24 hours following the transformation process, the body of the subject will show accelerated signs of decomposition, undergoing putrefaction approximately 18 hours after the transformation; necrophilic bacteria on the body of the subject demonstrate a level of activity commensurate with the most virulent strains of //Escherichia coli//. Accordingly, subjects under the influence of SCP-1418 should be considered active biohazards. The user's capacity to move and act progressively degenerates until at 23 hours and 50 minutes from transformation subjects undergo brain death.

Removal of the comb before approximately 22 hours from transformation will result in the reversion of the subject to their former state, with all vital signs returning to normal; this process takes approximately 10 minutes. After 22 hours, damage to the transformed body - whether related to the accelerated decomposition process or otherwise - is not fully reverted, with portions of the user's tissues typically continuing to exhibit necrosis. After the onset of brain death, removal of the comb from the subject fails to initiate reversion of the subject to their former physical condition.

**Recovery Log 1418**

SCP-1418 was recovered with 149 other articles and effects from the estate of the late Lady ████████ , a dowager of some notoriety who had been under Foundation surveillance due to her association with Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd. Lady ████████ 's body was found on the morning of ██/██/19██ ; she was reported to have been dead for approximately 4 weeks based on the condition of the body - however, Foundation surveillance agents had recorded a liaison between Lady ████████ and a figure assumed to be a lover the previous evening. Due to Lady ████████ 's high profile and connections to the peerage, an official inquest (which failed to record a cause of death) and public auction of her assets was permitted. All assets were successfully acquired by Foundation agents posing as representatives of various buyers. SCP-1418's properties were discovered only during exhaustive testing of the other recovered items, which proved non-anomalous and which were destroyed.

It remains unclear whether the body identified as Lady ████████ was indeed that of the dowager countess, and if not, at what point the substitution was made. Given the object's properties it cannot even be assumed that Lady ████████ was a single individual rather than several parties utilising SCP-1418. It is however noteworthy that the comb was found locked in a desk in the room Lady ████████ died, suggesting the death was not an accidental result of overuse of SCP-1418; given its observed properties in testing a third party would have needed to remove the item from the corpse.
