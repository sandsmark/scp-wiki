**Item #:** SCP-1464

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** The lake known as SCP-1464 is to be contained by a 15 meter high wall which completely surrounds the lake as well as its immediate environs, to be referred to as Containment Site-1464. At the southernmost point of the walls will be a surveillance station staffed at all times by four Level Three security staff. Surveillance is to take place 24/7 via cameras positioned every 2km along the wall, facing outwards. Due to possible memetic contagion, persons found attempting to violate the wall surrounding SCP-1464 are to be terminated on sight.

Photographic or video materials depicting SCP-1464 in any way are to be incinerated as soon as they are identified due to memetic hazard. Personnel who have come into contact with these materials are to be either administered Class A amnesiacs or terminated, depending on personnel value and progression of memetic contagion.

SCP-1464-2 is to be terminated as soon as it becomes possible to identify and neutralize them.

Under no circumstances are personnel above Level Three to become aware of any pertinent details regarding SCP-1464.

**Description:** The object and environment designated SCP-1464 consists of a lake in Northern ██████ and its surrounding environs, as well as any and all photographs or video footage of SCP-1464, which exhibit the same memetic properties as viewing the lake itself.

Formerly known as Lake ████████, SCP-1464 contains a memetic hazard which causes those who view it to believe that they and any and all other persons currently living who have been exposed to SCP-1464 have conspired together in the past to commit a massacre, usually described by those exposed to SCP-1464 as consisting of the ritualistic kidnapping and murder of ██-███ uninfected persons, followed by [DATA EXPUNGED] and their remains being thrown into the lake along with those of deceased infected persons. Bone fragments and non-biological matter recovered by D-class personnel during Expedition 1464-1-004 seem to confirm that this has occurred at least once in the past, though due to the memetic hazard involved in witnessing SCP-1464, further details are difficult to impossible to ascertain.

Persons infected by exposure to SCP-1464 frequently become wracked with guilt concerning the event they believe to have been involved in within three to five days of exposure. In 85% of cases, subjects attempt to seek out other individuals who have been exposed to SCP-1464 within two weeks; It is presently unknown how subjects become aware of one another. Subjects will also sometimes (in about ██% of cases) seek to expose others to SCP-1464; Frequently those individuals are people whom the subject feels close to and to whom they wish to "confess."

If allowed to run its course unchecked, roughly one month after exposure, effected subjects will gather in groups of ██-██ effected individuals and express their desire to "do it right this time." At this time, the group of subjects becomes identifiable as SCP-1464-2. SCP-1464-2 will attempt to re-create the ritualistic massacre referred to above, resulting in the deaths of an average ██ infected subjects and as many as ███ civilians, as well as an average of ██ exposure events.

**Addendum:** SCP-1464 came to Foundation attention in 19██, when a Foundation researcher began looking into rumors of Satanic rituals involving human sacrifice being performed in Northern ██████. Memetic contagion and subsequent performance of the massacre and [DATA EXPUNGED] by ██ Foundation personnel resulted in current containment procedures coming into effect as of 03/02/19██.


**Interview With Exposed Subject**

> **Interviewed:** Andrew ████, Ph.D
>  
> **Interviewer:** Dr. R███ Wing
>  
> **Foreword:** Dr. ████ was detained for questioning following observation by Level Three security staff attending SCP-1464 investigating the outer wall and was eventually identified as having been exposed to material pertaining to SCP-1464.
>  
> **<Begin Log, 09/15/19██, 15:06>**
>  
> **Dr. Wing:** Tell me when you first saw the lake, Doctor ████.
>
>[It is worth noting that the subject seems visibly shaken throughout the interview, exhibiting signs of increased blood pressure and heart rate.]
>  
> **Dr. ████:** What, that place? I've been there before. I was there when we-- when we.. [The subject swallows audibly before continuing.] I remembered when I saw the pictures.
>  
> **Dr. Wing:** Where did you find the pictures?
>  
> **Dr. ████:** In the library. The library in ███████. In ██████. I can't believe I spent all that time, //all that time// right next to it, just an hour's drive away, and didn't remember, didn't remember any of it until now. We didn't do it right, that's what makes it so awful. They died for //nothing//.
>  
> **Dr. Wing:** What did you do wrong, Dr. ████?
>  
> **Dr. ████:** [DATA EXPUNGED] she was still screaming and it all went wrong, everyone //died//, it's got to go right, we need to do it //right//. You understand, don't you?
>
>[Doctor Wing appears surprised to hear this.]
>  
> **Dr. Wing:** I know what?
>  
> **Dr. ████:** You've seen it, haven't you? The dreams. You remember [DATA EXPUNGED]
>
>[At this point, the subject seems almost manic, rising from his chair.]
>  
> **Dr. Wing:** Please sit down, Doctor ████. I don't know what you're talking about. Sit **down**.
>
>[The subject lunges across the table at Doctor Wing, who falls out of her chair and rises quickly to her feet, moving to the door as the subject attempts to grab her clothing and hair.]
>  
> **Dr. ████:** You all know! We all did it! And we'll do it right this time! We'll do it right this time!
>
>[Doctor Wing leaves the room, and the subject continues yelling.]
>  
> **<End Log, 09/15/19██, 15:25>**
>  
> **Closing Statement:** The subject, Dr. Andrew ████, was terminated following the interview. Dr. R███ Wing was subsequently identified as having been exposed to SCP-1464 in the past, whereupon she had been administered a Class A amnesiac. It is recommended that future interviews concerning subjects exposed to SCP-1464 do not involve staff who have been exposed in the past except for experimental purposes.
