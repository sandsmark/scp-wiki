**Item #:** SCP-1464

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** The lake known as SCP-1464 is to be contained by a 15 meter high, .5m thick wall which completely surrounds the lake as well as its immediate environs, to be referred to as Containment Site-1464. At the southernmost point of the walls will be a surveillance station staffed at all times by four Level Three security staff. Surveillance is to take place 24/7 via cameras positioned every 2km along the wall, facing outwards. Due to possible memetic contagion, persons found attempting to violate the wall surrounding SCP-1464 are to be transported to the nearest town, ███████, administered a Class A amnesiac, and released.

Photographic or video materials depicting SCP-1464 in any way, as well as any materials recovered from the lake, are to be incinerated as soon as they are identified due to memetic hazard. Personnel who have come into contact with these materials are to be either administered Class A amnesiacs or terminated, depending on personnel value and progression of memetic contagion.

SCP-1464-2 is to be terminated upon recognition.

In order to reduce risk of memetic contagion, under no circumstances are personnel above Level Three to become exposed in any way to materials relating to SCP-1464.

**Description:** The object and environment designated SCP-1464 consists of a lake in northern ██████ and its surrounding environs, as well as any and all photographs or video footage of SCP-1464, which exhibit the same memetic properties as viewing the lake itself.

Known to locals as Lake ████████, SCP-1464 is a visual, contagious memetic hazard. Visual exposure to the lake, recovered objects from the lake, or images and depictions of the lake cause the exposed subject to become immediately convinced that they and any other living persons who have been exposed to SCP-1464 or related artifacts have conspired in the past to commit a ceremonial massacre in order to prevent the end of the world. Subjects report the massacre of consisting of the ritual kidnapping and murder of between 25 and 160 uninfected persons, followed by [DATA EXPUNGED] and the remains being disposed of in the lake along with those of deceased infected subjects, usually numbering between 10 and 28. While details of the prior massacre may vary, including the number of victims, infected deaths, and [DATA EXPUNGED], the story remains relatively consistent between exposed individuals.

Bone fragments and non-biological matter recovered by D-class personnel during Expedition 1464-1-004 confirm that the ritual explained by infected subjects has occurred at least once prior to Foundation identification of SCP-1464. Results of this expedition and subsequent laboratory analysis of recovered artifacts and lake water prove that the memetic effects remain despite the artifacts being removed from the lake. Sufficiently detailed written documentation of the lake also causes infection in readers.

Persons infected by exposure to SCP-1464 will immediately begin to experience feelings of guilt concerning their participation in the ritual described above. Subjects typically describe a feeling of having done something "wrong," and express an urge to "correct their mistake" and "do it right this time." Subjects' response to probing regarding the ritual reveals that these feelings are related to their perceived inability to perform the ritual correctly rather than their participation in a mass murder.

Within two weeks of exposure, 85% of infected persons will begin to seek out other individuals who have been exposed to SCP-1464; It is presently unknown how these subjects become aware of one another. In 67% of cases, subjects will also begin to intentionally expose others to materials regarding SCP-1464 in order to infect them.

If the infection is allowed to run its course unchecked, within one month of exposure affected subjects will begin to gather in groups numbering between 15-50 affected individuals. That group, at this point, becomes known as SCP-1464-2. SCP-1464-2 members become reluctant to leave the group for any reason, reporting an increased urge to attempt the ritual again and asserting that if the ritual is performed correctly, the world will be "saved." The group will attempt to recreate the ritualistic massacre described above, usually resulting in already-listed casualties as well as an average of 32 exposure events. Survivors of the ritual are considered "cured" of SCP-1464 infection, though they may require psychiatric care or application of Class A amnesiacs in order to fully recover.

**Addendum 1:** SCP-1464 came to Foundation attention in 19██, when a Foundation researcher began looking into rumors of Satanic rituals involving human sacrifice being performed in northern ██████. Memetic contagion and subsequent performance of the massacre and [DATA EXPUNGED] by ██ Foundation personnel resulted in current containment procedures coming into effect as of 03/02/19██.

**Addendum 2:** Following incident 1464-C, it is recommended that SCP-1464-2 be terminated on sight by any means necessary in order to prevent the ritual.


**Interview With Exposed Subject**

> **Interviewed:** Andrew ████, Ph.D
>  
> **Interviewer:** Dr. R███ Wing
>  
> **Foreword:** Dr. ████ was detained for questioning following observation by Level Three security staff attending SCP-1464 investigating the outer wall and was eventually identified as having been exposed to material pertaining to SCP-1464.
>  
> **<Begin Log, 09/15/19██, 15:06>**
>  
> **Dr. Wing:** Tell me when you first saw the lake, Doctor ████.
>
>[It is worth noting that the subject seems visibly shaken throughout the interview, exhibiting signs of increased blood pressure and heart rate.]
>  
> **Dr. ████:** What, that place? I've been there before. I was there when we-- when we.. [The subject swallows audibly before continuing.] I remembered when I saw the pictures.
>  
> **Dr. Wing:** Where did you find the pictures?
>  
> **Dr. ████:** In the library. The library in ███████. In ██████. I can't believe I spent all that time, //all that time// right next to it, just an hour's drive away, and didn't remember, didn't remember any of it until now. We didn't do it right, that's what makes it so awful. They died for //nothing//.
>  
> **Dr. Wing:** What did you do wrong, Dr. ████?
>  
> **Dr. ████:** [DATA EXPUNGED] she was still screaming and it all went wrong, everyone //died//, it's got to go right, we need to do it //right//. You understand, don't you?
>
>[Doctor Wing appears surprised to hear this.]
>  
> **Dr. Wing:** I know what?
>  
> **Dr. ████:** You've seen it, haven't you? The dreams. You remember [DATA EXPUNGED]
>
>[At this point, the subject seems almost manic, rising from his chair.]
>  
> **Dr. Wing:** Please sit down, Doctor ████. I don't know what you're talking about. Sit **down**.
>
>[The subject lunges across the table at Doctor Wing, who falls out of her chair and rises quickly to her feet, moving to the door as the subject attempts to grab her clothing and hair.]
>  
> **Dr. ████:** You all know! We all did it! And we'll do it right this time! We'll do it right this time!
>
>[Doctor Wing leaves the room, and the subject continues yelling.]
>  
> **<End Log, 09/15/19██, 15:25>**
>  
> **Closing Statement:** The subject, Dr. Andrew ████, was terminated following the interview. Dr. R███ Wing was subsequently identified as having been exposed to SCP-1464 in the past, whereupon she had been administered a Class A amnesiac. It is recommended that future interviews concerning subjects exposed to SCP-1464 do not involve staff who have been exposed in the past except for experimental purposes.

**Incident Report 1464-C**
Group SCP-1464-2-6 was allowed to reach the perimeter wall surrounding SCP-1464 before members were pulled aside for questioning by Doctor █████ and two junior researchers. One member of SCP-1464-2-6 was a Foundation researcher who was exposed to a detailed written description of SCP-1464 produced by another infected subject. When pulled aside, the subject began to babble about how the ritual must be performed correctly in order to prevent an XK-Class End of the World Scenario. Group SCP-1464-2-6 terminated. Further research pending.
