My first article, and boy, does it show. My inspiration sprouted entirely from stumbling across the picture while looking for CC images. I thought I was being clever, with object turning on the Foundation. I really wasn't. The imagery used in the museum log is quite cool, but the piece has noticeable tonal issues. I might touch this one up someday.

As much as I enjoy horror, I'm a sucker for a good love story. To my knowledge, no one had really done the researcher-object angle, most likely because of the inherent baggage a piece like that comes with, and the difficulty of writing it. The idea of generation-crossed lovers, and (spoiler) dimension-crossed lovers appealed to me a lot, and it was a fun excuse to write characters. 5061 remains some of the most fun I've had while writing, and I've been flattered by the compliments of people who greatly enjoy this one.

This was born out of an offhand mention of monkeys, or something, in SCPD. It's a fun little character piece that took over a month to write, due to real life circumstances. Headcanon time, the //Obob'ans// are the creators of [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1000 SCP-1000], who in turn created earth's orangutans as a  homage to their gods. Oh, and the ending is an [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2317 SCP-2317] reference, if only for the convenience of not adding *another* eldritch abomination to the wiki's lore. I'm not sure how many people made that connection, but it's there. Psst, 2317 mentions Area-179 too.
