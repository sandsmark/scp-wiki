**Description:** SCP-4902 is a sapient King Owl brand refrigerator with a locking mechanism on its handle. Typical models of this refrigerator do not carry a locking handle. SCP-4902 has proven to be able to hear and comprehend speech despite its lack of sensory organs. SCP-4902 possesses the ability to manipulate magnetically charged objects placed on it. SCP-4902's only form of communication is through various magnetic letters; all attempts to use image-based magnets or languages with non-romanized letters, have thus far failed. 

**Discovery:** On 3/24/19, SCP-4902 was discovered at a family-owned furniture store, Bill's Best, following police reports of several messages spelled out with an alphabetic magnet set suggesting a child's body was hidden within SCP-4902. Review of the security footage showed the magnets moving across SCP-4902. The following day, Foundation agents arrived and amnesticized all persons involved.
