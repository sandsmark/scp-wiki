**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4751 is held in a humanoid containment chamber with no windows or visual recording equipment. Containment personnel are to communicate verbally with SCP-4751 via closed-circuit telephone at least once every 24 hours. In the event of a containment breach, recapture is to be facilitated by remote means such as traps activated by proximity or external control.

**Description:** SCP-4751 is a 27-year-old male of Guatemalan descent and United States nationality. When SCP-4751 is within an entity's field of vision, SCP-4751 becomes completely imperceptible to all of the entity's sensory modalities. The individual "viewing" SCP-4751 can neither see, feel, smell, touch, or hear the anomalous person. This effects extends to individuals viewing video footage of SCP-4751, who are likewise unable to detect SCP-4751 in the video feed. Clothes or other items worn or held by SCP-4751 are also undetectable.

The anomaly associated with SCP-4751's person manifested roughly 18 months prior to detainment by Foundation agents.

> 
> **Jirati:** Very good. Please be aware, at some point in the next 72 hours, it will be necessary to move you to a new containment chamber. Please be ready to carry all of your belongings, as you will not be permitted to make multiple trips.
> 
> **SCP-4751:** I don't even haveâ€”are you for real right now? What do you think I have in here when you won't let me have anything I can't wipe my ass with? I ask for a TV, request denied. Ask for books, request denied. Ask for a half-finished crossword puzzle, request denied. How many copies of that same form letter do I have? I'll need both hands to carry that stack.
>

> **SCP-4751:** Escape attempt? What are you talking about?
> 
> **Jirati:** Please, SCP-4751. You have nothing to gain by playing coy. It is important that you answer my question truthfully.
> 
> **SCP-4751:** Tell me, Geni, how do I be honest about a made-up jailbreak?
> 
> **Jirati:** Why did you attempt to breach containment? Do you find your living conditions uncomfortable?
> 
> **SCP-4751:** [//Scoffs//] You tell me, chief. You're the one concerned about accuracy and gathering data all the time. I'm sure you've got an Excel doc tracking my mood, or whatever.

> **Jirati:** Have you been in contact with any individuals, including non-human entities, outside of this facility?
