__**Threat ID**__: LTE-3503-Silver ("Vector")

__**Authorized Response Level**__: N/A (Confirmed Destroyed, File Archived)

__**Description**__: Subject was a human female of mixed European descent. Aside from deviations from normal listed below, subject was in all other aspects a baseline-normal human. Although no verifiable personal identification was found on the subject at the time of death, circumstantial evidence indicates that she was an American of approximately 19 years of age.

Subject was a "Type Silver" infectious hazard, limited to organisms of single-cell or simpler complexity. Subject possessed immunity to all forms of bacterial and viral infections, as well as the ability to extract bacteria and viruses from infected individuals and cultivate any such organism capable of infecting a human being within her own body. Subject also possessed the ability to deliver said infectious agents to other individuals by airborne aerosol distribution. 

At the time of liquidation, subject was host to over one thousand infectious agents, including Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), several dozen strains of influenza, as well as several instances of //E. coli// and bubonic plague.

__**Liquidation**__: Subject was first encountered in mainland China during a SARS epidemic, where she was seen passing through quarantine wards engaging in close contact with an infected individual. Individual was categorized as a Level 0 person of interest when the aforementioned infectee later recovered from their illness at an unusually rapid pace.

Subject was later encountered in Africa during an outbreak of Ebola "Zaire." Again, subject was seen engaging in close contact with an infected individual who later recovered from what is normally a fatal stage of Ebola infection. GOC Assessment Team "Jellybean" made initial contact with the subject at her hotel room in Johannesburg, South Africa. Subject then caused the death of team leader "Cotton" by rapid-onset necrotizing fasciitis, at which point the remaining team members fired upon the subject with their sidearms, terminating her life.

Subject's hotel room was declared a Level 4 Biohazard threat, and a WHO rapid-response team was dispatched to secure and sterilize the area. Further investigation of the subject's belongings revealed a personal manifesto, the text of which is reproduced below. It is believed that the manifesto was intended to be released after a planned release of the subject's infectious payload in an unknown city in Germany.

As no verifiable personal information was found on the subject at the time of her death, no Information Control measures are required. The case file was closed on █/█/██.

__**Appendix 1**__: Text of Personal Manifesto

> Dear Fat Cats, Assholes, Sheeple, and Oligarchs,
> 
> You see now what one angry girl can do, right? You see now what happens when an entire country forgets about the things they did? Six million Jewish lives scream out for vengeance, and Germany lives on, fat and happy, drinking the blood of the children they killed. Not today. Today those Nazi fascists have gotten a taste of their own medicine. And you're next.
> 
> You can't stop me. You can't control me. I'm everyone and everything. If you don't do what I say, Germany is going to just be the start. There's only one way to prevent it: STOP ACTING LIKE ASSHOLES AND START GIVING A SHIT.
> 
> 1. There are too many poor people in the world living on stale rice and muddy water while fat rich bitches throw away half their mongolian barbecue trays at the food court at the mall. This has to stop. No one should be hungry, and the rich fucks need to be dragged out into the street and hanged.
> 
> 2. What did whales ever do to those Japanese assholes anyway? If the Japanese CANNIBALS don't stop MASSACREING THE WHALES, then Tokyo's going to think a nuclear bomb got dropped on it AGAIN.
> 
> 3. STOP THE GLOBAL WARMING NOW. Why should oil companies profit off of the SLOW STRANGULATION OF OUR MOTHER EARTH? No one needs a car anyway. BAN GREENHOUSE GASSES RIGHT NOW OR YOU'RE GOING TO SEE WHAT IT REALLY LOOKS LIKE WHEN YOU CAN'T BREATHE AND THE TEMPERATURE RISES.
> 
> None of this is hard. All it requires is that you give a FUCKING SHIT and stop acting like a TOTAL ASSHOLE to each other.
> 
> I'm watching you. And I'm waiting. 
> 
> VECTOR.

The document was signed with a crudely hand-drawn picture of a biohazard symbol.

__**Threat ID:**__ KTE-1027-Grey "Skulljumper"

__**Authorized Response Level:**__ 3 (Moderate Threat)

__**Description:**__ Organism closely resembles a human Central Nervous System (CNS) adapted to survival outside of a human body. Organism consists of a brain, spinal cord, nervous system, and associated visual and auditory sensory inputs. Deviations from baseline human normal include a thickened myelin sheathing, and full-length glial coatings, permeable to neurotransmitter compounds. Organism seems to rely on these neurotransmitter compounds for survival: feeding is accomplished by close contact, through a process similar to osmosis. Prolonged parasitism will result in the death of the host due to asphyxiation and disruption of bodily functions.

Reproduction is carried out through a process similar to budding: upon encountering a deceased human central nervous system of sufficient integrity, organism will deliver a modified dopamine compound and 150 millivolt electrical charge to the brain through the auditory canal. The nervous system will then detach itself from the host body, forming a new instance of KTE-1027-Grey.

__**Rules of Engagement:**__ Instances of KTE-1027-Grey are to be terminated by gunfire: close contact is not recommended. Although not particularly fast, the organism has been observed attacking from ambush. On at least one instance, a GOC Strike Team member was infected by an instance of this organism, and turned upon his fellow team members, resulting in multiple casualties.

Instances of KTE-1027-Grey feeding upon a host body are more problematic. Due to the close proximity to the human host, termination by gunfire without injuring or killing the host body can often prove impossible. GOC Directive 1027-Grey-Alpha requires that GOC operatives prioritize termination of the organism over the survival of the host body: Third Mission (Protection) concerns being trumped by First and Second Mission (Survival and Concealment) requirements.

In the case of a widespread outbreak, the use of neurological toxins has been proven effective. As this would require an escalation of Response Level from 3 (Moderate) to Response Level 4 (Severe), operatives should obtain permission from higher authority before carrying out a plan utilizing said nerve agents. Operatives are, of course, expected to take any measures necessary in an emergency, but should expect their actions to be reviewed by a Court of Inquiry.

+++++ Addenda: Recommendation of Deactivation With Honor by Personnel Director "Ukelele"
> Agent "Snapshot" has served with distinction and honor for over four years. However, in recent months, the demands of field duty have caused increased stress and psychological difficulties, particularly around the issue of taking human life, which Agent Snapshot appears incapable of doing. It is estimated that a psychological breakdown may occur within the next two years. 
> 
> In the interests of preserving a useful asset to the Coalition, it is my recommendation that Agent Snapshot be removed from active service from Special Circumstances and placed in Reserves. Agent Snapshot has agreed to serve the Global Occult Coalition on a freelance basis, should any circumstances arise that require her special talents.
> 
> On a more personal note: I have had the opportunity to observe Agent Snapshot in action several times over the past few years. Her courage and dedication to the Global Occult Coalition has never been in doubt. I wish Agent Snapshot the best of luck in her new life, and wish her happiness and peace.
> 
> - Director "Ukelele"
