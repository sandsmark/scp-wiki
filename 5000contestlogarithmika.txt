++++ NOTICE FROM THE FOUNDATION DEPARTMENT OF PATAPHYSICS

Due to recent developments, study and research of SCP-5000 has been transferred to the Department of Pataphysics. The following document, corresponding to the last revision by the Department of Anomalous Locations, will be kept as reference until an updated version is ready.

**Special Containment Procedures:** Personnel assigned to SCP-5000 containment and research duty are to be administered regular doses of Class-W mnestics to counteract its antimemetic effects. An exclusion zone, 15 km in diameter, is to be enforced around SCP-5000. Any images of the Atacama Desert found in social and public media that might contain SCP-5000 are to be censored. SCP-5000 is partially self-contained, and thus no further measures are needed.

##blue|**IMPORTANT NOTICE:** No further expeditions into SCP-5000 are to be scheduled, by order of Dr. Menard.##

**Description:** SCP-5000 is a tower located in the Atacama Desert, Chile, approximately 60 km away from the city of CopiapÃ³, the closest population center. Direct observation of SCP-5000 has a mild cognitohazardous effect, making observers convinced that they ought not to be there, and that "something terrible will happen" if they reach the top floor. Furthermore, an antimemetic effect is present, erasing all memories of SCP-5000 after leaving its line of sight.

SCP-5000 has seven floors, which exhibit vastly different and anachronical architectural styles. While it appears that the entrances of each stairway leading from one floor to the next were sealed in the past via several mechanisms (both anomalous and nonanomalous), most of these seals appear to have been broken at some point in the past. The reason for this is unknown.

Several objects that appear to be linked to known Groups of Interest have been found during expeditions into SCP-5000. Dating of these objects is inconsistent, and no connections between these Groups of Interest and current or former inhabitants of the zone have been found.
