**Item #:** SCP-075

**Object Class**: Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures**: SCP-075 is to remain contained in a 1 m x 1 m x 1 m Level-4 acid-resistant container, itself kept in an equally acid-resistant secure chamber. The relative humidity of the chamber may not exceed 1% at any time. Medical-grade desiccants must be available at all times in order to maintain this level of humidity. If the relative humidity of SCP-075's chamber ever exceeds 1%, all personnel are to be evacuated immediately and the site will be locked down until the humidity is brought back to acceptable levels.

All personnel who enter SCP-075's containment chamber must wear Level-4 hermetic suits with self-contained respiration apparatus. Injection tests, as well as any test which involves an aqueous solution, are strictly forbidden. If any such solution comes into contact with SCP-075, the area will be immediately locked down and flooded with desiccant until the humidity is brought back to acceptable levels. Any personnel in said area will not be allowed to evacuate.

**Description**: SCP-075 has the shape of a snail, except its muscular foot resembles a six-fingered hand. It is 20 cm in length, 13 cm in width, and 15 cm in height, with a mass of approximately 860 kg. This exceptional density has yet to be understood. When almost completely dry, SCP-075 remains in a dormant state. Desiccation is the only known means of containing SCP-075.

When not desiccated, SCP-075 moves at incredible speeds for its size and mass. It adopts the behavior of a predator, jumping at and drenching its prey in an acidic solution seemingly secreted from pores on its foot. These secretions are more corrosive than any known acid. Given SCP-075's threatening level when not disabled, this acid may not be harvested. Therefore, no material resistant to its corrosive power has been found yet.

**Addendum [SCP-075f]:** All tests meant to harvest SCP-075's acid must be approved and supervised by all Level-4 personnel of the site. However, approval of said personnel can not override the interdiction to introduce any liquid solution near SCP-075, including its acid.

**Addendum [SCP-075g]:** A cup of acid from SCP-075 was successfully harvested by using [[[SCP-294]]]. Testing is underway to determine what, if any, known substance is immune to the acid. Testing is also underway to determine why the cup provided by SCP-294 is inherently immune to the acid's effects.
