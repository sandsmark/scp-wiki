**Item #:** SCP-464

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:**

SCP 464 is not dangerous in itself.  However, it should always be hidden from the general public.  As it is too large to move, a large shopping mall has been built around it.  An explanation has been made for the cavity in the shopping mall.  Employees there have been trained to give that explanation upon questions.  For access to SCP 464, take the underground tunnell at ███████████.

**Description:**

SCP 464 is a large building.  When it was found, it was in the middle of the woods.  It has 5 rooms in it.  4 are of approximately equal in size, but the fifth is far smaller, and in the center of the others.  Rooms 1-3 are all very large factory floors.  Each of them have 5 machines in them.  These machines are identical copies of one another, and indeed Rooms 1-3 are identical.  Room 4 has since been cleaned up.  When found, it had a very large pile of dismantled and destroyed parts of machinery, as well as various decapacitated animal and human parts.  The animal parts are not identifiable as belonging to any known species.  On top of the pile was sitting [DATA EXPUNGED].  This has since been classified as SCP-464-1.  It was deemed unsafe to keep and thus was destroyed by luring it to the site of a nuclear testing ground.  However, many casualties were suffered in this effort.  The animal parts, as well as destroyed machinery, is currently under study.  Room 5 has a wide variety of controls.  There is one large On/Off button, but this does not appear to refer to any of the machinery.  It rather seems to turn on a normal intercom system throughout the building.  The panels are the unusual bit.  There are 16 panels.  15 of them are identical.
The first 15 panels have the following:
A label indicating which panel it is (1-15)
1 switch labeled on/off
1 switch labeled male/female
1 dial including most races on the earth along with "Paradisian" and "Gray"
1 dial, starting at 0 and ending at 75
1 dial, starting at 76 and ending at 150
The 16th panel, however, has the following:
A label indicating which panel it is (16)
1 switch labeled on/off
1 switch labeled male/female
1 dial that seems to have dashes labeled as months, ending at 50 years
1 dial labeled Intelligence, ranging from 1 to 10,000
1 dial labeled Strength, ranging from 1 to 10,000
1 dial labeled Social, ranging from 1 to 10,000
When SCP 464 was found, Intelligence, Strength, and Social were all near the 10,000 mark.
The machines in rooms 1 through 3 all seem to be connected to the first 15 panels.  When panel 1 was turned on, for example, the first machine in room 1 turned on.  It began creating humans.  The settings on panel 1 were male/asian/0/76.  The humans created were newborn asian males.  The significance of the number 76 was not at that time known.  Later tests (on settings male/caucasian/75/76) seem to show that the date signifies at what age the produced humans will die of old age.
Humans produced in rooms 1, 2, and 3 are not created in a manner similar to cloning, or for that matter birth.  Rather, the machines seem to create each body part individually, in a nonactive state.  Then, they are put together and activated.
Panel 16 does not appear to do anything.  It is possible that it was connected previously to something in Room 4.
