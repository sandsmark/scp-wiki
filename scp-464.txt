**Item #:** SCP-464

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:**

SCP 464 is not dangerous.  However,  as it is too large to move, a  warehouse has been built around it for security purposes. SCP-464 is to be fully staffed by a rotating guard compliment of seven, to keep out the curious. For access to SCP 464, take the underground tunnel at ███████████.

**Description:**

SCP 464 is a large building.  When it was found, it was in the middle of the woods.  It has 5 rooms in it.  4 are of approximately equal in size, but the fifth is far smaller, and in the center of the others.  Rooms 1-3 are all very large factory floors.  Each of them have 5 machines in them.  These machines are identical copies of one another, and indeed Rooms 1-3 are identical.  

Room 4 has been cleaned up since it was first discovered.  When found, it had a very large pile of dismantled and destroyed parts of machinery, as well as various decapitated animal and human parts.  The animal parts are not identifiable as belonging to any known species.  On top of the pile was sitting [DATA EXPUNGED].  This has since been classified as SCP-464-1.  It was deemed unsafe to keep and thus was destroyed by the usual means, resulting in an acceptable level of casualties.  The animal parts, as well as all destroyed machinery, are currently under study.  

Room 5 has a wide variety of controls.  There is one large On/Off button, that turns on a building wide intercom system.  There are 16 panels.  15 of them are identical.

The first 15 panels have the following:
A label indicating which panel it is (1-15.)
1 switch labeled on/off.
1 switch labeled male/female.
1 dial including most races on the earth along with "Paradisian" and "Gray."
1 dial, starting at 0 and ending at 75.
1 dial, starting at 76 and ending at 150.

The 16th panel, however, has the following:
A label indicating which panel it is (16.)
1 switch labeled on/off.
1 switch labeled male/female.
1 dial with  dashes labeled as months, ending at 600 months.
1 dial labeled Mental, ranging from 1 to 10,000.
1 dial labeled Physical, ranging from 1 to 10,000.
1 dial labeled Social, ranging from 1 to 10,000.

When SCP 464 was found, Mental, Physical, and Social were all near the 10,000 mark.

The machines in rooms 1 through 3 all seem to be connected to the first 15 panels.  When panel 1 was turned on, for example, the first machine in room 1 turned on, and began creating humans.  The settings on panel 1 were male/asian/0/76.  The humans created were newborn asian males.  The significance of the number 76 was not at that time known.  Later tests (on settings male/caucasian/75/76) seem to show that the date signifies at what age the produced humans will die of old age.

Humans produced in rooms 1, 2, and 3 are not created in a manner similar to cloning, or for that matter birth.  Rather, the machines seem to create each body part individually, in a nonactive state.  Then, they are put together and activated.

Panel 16 does not appear to do anything.  It is possible that it was connected previously to something in Room 4.
