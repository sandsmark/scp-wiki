**Item #:** SCP-877

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Protocols:** All copies of SCP-877 are to be kept in electromagnetically sealed containers in the Site 19 storage vault. Containers are to be fitted with radio receivers set to scan all frequencies for incoming or outgoing transmissions. A log of previously used frequencies is to be kept on file. Any transmission from any copy of SCP-877 is to be reported immediately to Site 19 command. All efforts are to be made to capture as many specimens of SCP-877 as possible, to determine any of the object's other abilities

**Description:** SCP-877 is a set of --four-- --ten-- twelve microchips acquired between 199█ and 201█ from the cerebral cortices of different small mammals. Animals found to contain copies of SCP-877 include, but are not limited to, //Sciurus carolinensis// (eastern gray squirrel), //Felix domesticatus//, and //Eumops perotis// (the Western Mastiff bat). The microchips are unmarked except for small stamps, readable only by electron microscope, that read “████████ UNIVERSITY BIOLOGY DEPT,” followed by “GENERATION” and a number. However, no records exist of an institution named “████████ University.” Moreover, the abilities of these microchips are beyond the technological capability of any known laboratory to create.

Copies of SCP-877 have a potential processing speed of ███ terahertz and storage capability estimated at ███ petabytes. The chips are capable of interfacing with and controlling the motor functions of host creatures, though it will usually allow the animals' instincts to carry out routine affairs (eating, nesting, mating). 

SCP-877 has --only-- primarily been noted to take over its host for the purpose of propagating itself (see Addendum 877-2). The mechanism by which this takes place is unknown, but the behavior associated is well-documented. A host animal will approach another animal and immobilize it by the most expedient means available to it. The host will bite the creature somewhere on the head, making blood contact between the animals. The original host will release the animal after ten minutes. 

Within twenty-four hours, a new copy of SCP-877 will emerge in the new host; the chip will be slightly smaller and the generation number will have advanced by one. --The highest generation number located to date is █-- (see Addendum 877-2 for update), and each chip appears to be capable of propagating itself six times, implying that the total population of SCP-877 may be in the --millions-- tens of millions.

**Recovery Log:** The first copy of SCP-877 located was discovered by zoological researchers at the University of [REDACTED] in 199█ during a typical dissection. Its unusual presence inside the creature drew the attention of Foundation scientists, who determined it to be a first generation chip. Analysis of unusual energy readings from the chip led to scanning for radio transmissions with a frequency of [REDACTED], leading to the capture of two more chips. Instances of SCP-877 began changing frequencies repeatedly; however, having several specimens in captivity made tracking easier. 

**Addendum 877-1:** After acquiring the tenth specimen on February ██, 201█, all instances of SCP-877 in captivity ceased transmitting on all frequencies, and all known frequencies for SCP-877 transmission went dead. O5 Command believes the rest of the chips are communicating on scrambled frequencies and continuing their propagation cycles. Without any understanding of the chips' origins or ultimate goal, the threat level of SCP-877 is to be considered high and attempts to locate specimens of and materials relating to SCP-877 should be considered top priority.

**Addendum 877-2:** On three separate occasions in September of 201█, reports were received of attacks against isolated humans by clusters of animals of different species working together. One attack involved cooperation between two Boston terriers, four squirrels, and a garter snake attacking an eleven-year-old child who had strayed into a wooded area near her home. Using radio frequency tracking, the two terriers were contained; presence of SCP-877 was confirmed by dissection. Both specimens were marked "GENERATION ██" and were located deeper in the cerebrum, making discovery more difficult.
