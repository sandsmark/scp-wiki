++ **Special Containment Procedures:** 

Foundation webcrawlers and archivists are currently employed to locate and destroy as much information as possible regarding the constituent components required of SCP-5711. RCT-Δt Temporal Intelligence Community (TIC) assets are instructed to, wherever possible, infiltrate active Mekhanist and Sarkic cells across the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries of all known historical iterations to locate, confiscate, and destroy or alter all references to their historical ties to the Daevite civilization.

The area surrounding SCP-5711-1 is secured under the auspices of a decommissioned US Military missile silo with full cooperation of the US Government at a range of 2 km. Cover Story RAD-5[[footnote]]"Severe ionizing radiation hazard."[[/footnote]] is in effect for all unauthorized persons attempting to access SCP-5711-1. No personnel outside of the Δ clearance group are permitted knowledge of SCP-5711, SCP-5711-1, or any Foundation temporal eigenweapon development project. Exploration of SCP-5711-1 may only be undertaken by RCT-Δt assets with >150 hrs mission time logged due to possible residual temporal anomalies on site. 

As of 31/1/2010, the Applied Sciences Division of RCT-Δt has been commissioned to design and construct a device matching the description of SCP-5711-2 by whatever means necessary.

RCT-Δt internal clearance for this file is set to L5/Δ.

++ **Description:** 

SCP-5711 is a thaumaturgic ritual capable of altering the course of historical events without direct intervention by traditional temporal displacement methodology. Recovered materials from SCP-5711-1 suggest that the ritual and the apparatus involved in its completion were developed by the [[[SCP-140|Daevite Civilization]]] as recently as 250 - 200 BCE. Due to the success of containment efforts, few details of the specifics of the ritual remain available. Known components of the ritual include the following:

# 57 kg beryllium bronze alloy, machined into mechanical device of indeterminate function.
# 0.5 L of blood, presumably from the lead officiant of the ritual
# At least 3 additional witnesses/participants
# An altar/temple complex[[footnote]]Minimum requirements for the construction of this temple are unknown.[[/footnote]]
# One prepubescent human child

Investigation into possible sources of SCP-5711 has uncovered many similarities between modern Mekhanist / Sarkic cults and religious practices of the ancient Daevite civilization. The current containment strategy assumes that the remaining details of SCP-5711 were derived from extant classical Mekhanist and Sarkic religious texts. Based on recovered material, the intended target of this ritual was a period either immediately prior to or during the Second Punic War[[footnote]]A seminal ancient military conflict between the republics of Carthage and Rome, resulting in the destruction of the Carthaginian state.[[/footnote]], and was ostensibly intended to alter the outcome of that conflict. 

SCP-5711-1 designates a temple complex in northern [[span class="dblock"]]Arizona[[/span]] constructed for the purpose of carrying out SCP-5711. The complex consists of several small residential dwellings, an open-air temple for religious worship, and a large, flat pyramid with a recessed top containing an altar, dimensions 300 x 300 x 200 m. The interior of the pyramid contains several damaged pieces of anomalous machinery, as well as some evidence that its interior dimensions were intended to be larger than its exterior dimensions, though this is no longer the case. Beneath the central pyramid structure is a network of tunnels connecting the residential area, the temple area, and five tunnels which suddenly terminate in open pits with depths greater than 100 m. Exploration of these areas is ongoing.

SCP-5711-1-PRIME designates an extranormal event which took place over the area of SCP-5711-1 on [[span class="dblock"]]29/12/2009[[/span]] at [[span class="dblock"]]1232[[/span]] hrs. According to Tactical Operations Command (TOC) assets and photographic evidence, a large black sphere expanded suddenly over the entirety of SCP-5711-1 and remained present for 2 hrs and 17 mins. Its appearance was accompanied by no other perceptible phenomena; however, XACTS monitoring devices in place at  Site-██ over 200 km away recorded a 128 W tachyon flux[[footnote]]Term used for any rapid change in local temporal relationships.[[/footnote]] during the same period. Calculations suggest the local power of this flux exceeded 20 MW, making it the single most powerful known temporal event in Foundation history.

SCP-5711-2 refers to a theoretical temporal eigenweapon[[footnote]]Term coined in the late 1990's referring any anomalous weapon of mass destruction.[[/footnote]] capable of neutralizing and/or reversing the effects of retrocausal anomalies in the event that preventative measures could not be implemented. Based on observations, the weapon is capable of initiating a causal isolation of an area of approximately 34 km^^3^^ for a period of approximately 2 hrs. The method by which this is achieved is currently unknown.

++ **Discovery:**

On [[span class="dblock"]]11/10/2009[[/span]], Temporal Site-01 alerted native Site-17 of an incoming TK-Class Causal Restructuring event, citing 782 new documentation inconsistencies logged in a 45 second period. Native Tactical Operations Command (TOC) assets immediately triangulated the time and location of the disturbance, and deployed to investigate and neutralize prior to the completion of the restructuring event. Upon arrival, TOC Assets reported the sudden appearance and subsequent disappearance of SCP-5711-1-PRIME and announced their intent to continue with the intended infiltration of SCP-5711-1. Personnel may access TOC-5711-01 for the full report of the resulting incursion.

**Log JN-5711-01:** Journal recovered from SCP-5711-1 by Sgt. Edward Freedman during TOC action on [[span class="dblock"]]11/10/2009[[/span]]. Entries are undated, presented in the order written. 
**Overview:** High Priest Khazaard Bin Alarath (POI-5711KZ-09) is believed to be one of the last remaining blood descendants of the Daevite priesthood. His personal writings detail his relationship with Daevite culture, religious observances, future goals, and, ostensibly, SCP-5711, which he considered to be his life's work. Although full details of the ritual cannot be deduced, some of the prerequisites for its completion are detailed in the passages below. Writings have been redacted for brevity and relevance.

> Father,
> 
> After searching for months or perhaps years, I have found dozens of them. Lost among the Nälkän pigs, they cowered fearfully before their slave-god, unaware of the glory of their birthright. I have no doubt that these acolytes will serve our purposes well. Promises of knowledge and wisdom excite and enthrall them. How many of our people has time erased? How many more are shackled in the darkness of the jailers' vaults? How long have we labored under the yokes of lesser men whose greatest achievement is the mere division of motes of dust in the furnace of being?
> 
> I do my best to remember patience, but I hunger for the days to come.  The Tome[[footnote]]Believed to be a reference to [[[SCP-140]]].[[/footnote]] may be lost to us, but there are copies which are bound to it. If one can be found, it may yet be possible to bring about the future we were promised.

> Father,
> 
> Rome was ever an enemy of us. Their stolen gods mocked our legacy. And by their ascension was our final fall ensured. Curse their names eternally. I shall yet paint red the pages of history and cleanse them of the Roman perversion. Pity that the good work before mine must be discarded in darkness eternal. There must be a way to open that rift again. Those former Nälkä who reside with me now may know something, but the hatred of their slave-god is more likely by half to have twisted the truth above preserving it. But there are other adherents of the ancient rites in this world which remain...

> Father,
> 
> My instincts have been confirmed and my faith grows yet stronger. I have found a copy of the Sacred Tome in the hands of the Broken. Seven of their rank joined our number today and delivered it as an offering to their Priest. These Broken are suspicious of the Nälkä; an old hatred stirs in their hearts. But they can be directed. From the fires of that hatred I will reforge that which was lost.
> 
> Of the Tome: it ends with Rome's ascent, as I had feared. But it hints at a place where the wheel of fate may be tipped. The man Hannibal and his armies held the nascent Romans over their knee and nearly destroyed that bastard republic. If he can be reached - strengthened, brought into the fold - then we may ride the tide of history to the present; our influence will be as absolute as the stepchildren of the Latin tongue. I am certain of it.

> Father,
> 
> The Broken know the sacred bronze. Not merely how to craft it but how to forge it and mold it into whatever shape they desire. Of this the Nälkä are cautious; so used to flesh and bone are they that they have forgotten. I have instructed them to sleep with an ingot each beneath their pillows that they might come to understand it as I have. Those which do not? Well... our temple //will// need a foundation...

> Father,
> 
> Groundbreaking today. I have my foundation. Five souls ought to do it, one in the center and one at each cardinal point. I hope Daevon will look upon this blood offering with favor in the time ahead. The heat which rises from our little pits assures me that he does.
> 
> The Broken continue their work on the divine machine their ancestors forbade them from building, and the remaining Nälkä are working with them on the arts of flesh. I wish you could see it, Father. The things they are creating. It's everything you've ever told to me and better. I can hear the spheres singing in the presence of their handiwork. Colors I had but imagined in dreams and visions before now dance in our workshops daily as the children ready themselves for the rite ahead.
> 
> For I have done it, Father. I've divined the secret of the Tome. Our solution is less elegant, perhaps, but draws from the same rhythmic music of the sacred bronze, powered by creation, and struck in concert to actualize the prayer. A suitable offering, however, and setting... This may perhaps be more difficult to obtain.

> Father,
> 
> The genius of the ancients was boundless.
> 
> I had suspected the answer lay somewhere in the collected memories of ourselves and our bastard children, and fate has proven me correct. It is an ancient prayer, in a language lost to time. But squirreled away in the minds of the flesh-crafters and the machinists, its purpose has been found. [[span class="dblock"]]The Harvest of Bone,  that ancient year end rite[[/span]], is a vehicle of manifestation. Those offerings of flesh and blood did no such paltry thing as win us favor with the gods, but manifested our Empire's destiny in spite of them. With proper alignment, my life's work will be completed, and my glory shall surpass even yours.

> Father,
> 
> It is done. The offering has been plucked from the herd of man. She exceeds perfection. And with the flesh-crafters' eye to anatomy and the machinists' divine artifice, we cannot lose. 

> Papa,
> 
> Blackness. Rot. Our triumph dashed to rubble. All is ash. The sky is broken, I was sure it would herald our victory. Instead, we have been defiled.
> I saw it so clearly... Why? Why hast Daevon left me?

That the good guys went down swinging and we did our best to keep the world okay? And if you're in any kind of condition to make it right...

> **Closing Note:** //Date and Time noted by Captain Watts,,0,, in this recording corresponds exactly to the observation of SCP-5711-1-PRIME. Despite Cpt Watts,,0,, apparent failure to contain SCP-5711, causal normalcy has been conserved, implying successful containment. As such, [[span class="dblock"]]1502 hrs on 11/10/2009[[/span]] has been flagged as the intended target for SCP-5711-2 upon the project's completion. Successful deployment of SCP-5711-2 at this date and time will constitute final neutralization of SCP-5711. Containment procedures will remain in effect until this project is completed.//
