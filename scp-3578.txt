**Item #:** SCP-3578

**Object Class:** --Safe-- Neutralized

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3578 is to be kept in a 7m x 7m General-Purpose Containment Chamber that is conjoined to an adjacent 10m x 10m Humanoid Containment Chamber via antechamber. This secondary containment chamber is to be used for the containment of any SCP-3578-A instances that emerge from SCP-3578. Both chambers are to be well maintained and cleaned on a bi-weekly basis to prevent bacteria growth that may be caused by the buildup of mucus and discharge from SCP-3578. Currently, SCP-3578 and all instances of SCP-3578-A are housed at Site-23.

Two members of on-site security detail are to remain posted outside of SCP-3578's containment chamber at all times. In the case of an emergence event, the guards are to enter the chamber and keep watch over SCP-3578 until the assigned medical and research teams arrive to assist in and document the emergence process.

**Edit:** As of October ██, 200█, SCP-3578's remains are kept in cryostorage at Site-23 while SCP-3578-A-31 has been moved to an 8m x 8m Standard Humanoid Containment Chamber outfitted to suit the needs of a young girl and remains under the care of Dr. Isaac Ruxton and Dr. Janette Crawford.

**Description:** SCP-3578 appears to be a disembodied reproductive system vaguely resembling that of a human female consisting of a uterus, cervix, fallopian tubes, ovaries, and partial vaginal passage. The vaginal passage ends abruptly at the point where it would have normally transitioned to the vulva, although there is no sign of injury at this point. SCP-3578 is capable of asexual reproduction and functions normally as if it were still inside a living body, maintaining healthy blood circulation and having regular menstrual cycles between the emergence of an instance of SCP-3578-A and the formation of a new instance. 

Contrary to its appearance, the DNA of SCP-3578 does not match up to that of a human and is not from any known species. It is also considerably larger than the reproductive system of a human female, measuring in at roughly five hundred percent larger and being able to expand to accommodate instances of SCP-3578-A reaching sizes of a three-year-old human child.

SCP-3578-A refers to the organisms that emerge from SCP-3578 every 12-16 months. Instances of SCP-3578-A develop inside of SCP-3578 for a minimum of 10 months before emerging, and there is always 2 or more months between the emergence of an instance of SCP-3578-A and the initial formation of a new instance. These creatures are always biologically female and behave in a docile manner, but do not seem to possess any form of higher brain function. 

In order to survive, SCP-3578-A instances require a surrogate --'mother'-- parent who they form a deep psychological bond with, only accepting nutrition and care provided by this person after imprinting on them. This person will henceforth be classified as SCP-3578-B until the SCP-3578-A instance in their care expires. Since the initial discovery of SCP-3578, the instances of SCP-3578-A have been progressively changing in appearance and biological makeup, with each subsequent emergence resulting in a more developed organism. Recent instances have been seemingly bipedal in nature and have shown many physiological similarities to humans.

**Discovery:** SCP-3578 was discovered on the floor of an empty operating room by a nurse in ██ ███████ Hospital in ███████, Arizona on February ██, 196█. Staff were informed immediately by the nurse and the Foundation was tipped off soon after when the anomalous nature of the organ was noted, mainly its non-human origin and the fact that it was still functioning despite being disconnected from a living body. Foundation operatives arrived at the scene soon after and took possession of the anomalous organ and promptly amnestized all who had come into contact with or had been informed of it before transporting it to Site-23 for further analysis and study.

**Addendum 3578.1:** Recorded Instances of SCP-3578-A Emergence Events

There have been a total of thirty-one instances of SCP-3578-A that have emerged from SCP-3578 prior to its expiration. The following records contain reports regarding all notable instances of SCP-3578-A. For a complete list, please contact the Administrator.

> 
> **Length of Gestation:** 10 Months, 13 Days
> 
> **Time Elapsed During Emergence:** 13 Hours, 27 Minutes
> 
> **Report:** Following the containment of SCP-3578, the organ expanded significantly over a ten month period. Ultrasounds revealed the presence of an organism developing inside of the uterus of SCP-3578, although further examination revealed very weak vital signs. When the organism emerged from SCP-3578 after it went into labor there were no signs of life and the creature, later classified as SCP-3578-A-1, was pronounced stillborn.
> 
> Visually, this instance of SCP-3578-A appeared to be a grotesque mass of muscle and connective tissue roughly the size of a human baby. Examination of the creature revealed that it had no skeletal structure and contained only a malformed heart and a single lung. DNA testing was inconclusive and showed no similarities to any known species on record.

> 
> **Time Elapsed During Emergence:** 15 Hours, 09 Minutes
> 
> **Report:** For three months following the first emergence event, SCP-3578 began having regular menstrual cycles. Over the course of a four or five day period every four weeks, SCP-3578 expelled a form of discharge from the end of its vaginal passage that examination revealed to be blood and other material from the uterine lining.
> 
> Three months and seventeen days after the previous emergence event, SCP-3578 did not begin its usual menstruation period and further examination revealed that a new instance of SCP-3578-A was forming. Continued ultrasounds and examinations showed a similar mass and equally weak vitals in comparison to SCP-3578-A-1, and the emergence of SCP-3578-A-2 resulted in another stillbirth.
> 
> Although quite similar to SCP-3578-A-1, SCP-3578-A-2 possessed four small appendages and showed greater development in its organs, with this instance having a partial kidney along with a more fully-formed heart and lung. The research team hypothesizes that future instances of SCP-3578-A will have even greater development, and a living specimen is expected to emerge eventually.

> 
> **Time Elapsed Since Previous Emergence:** 2 Months, 3 Days
> 
> **Length of Gestation:** 11 Months, 22 Days
> 
> **Time Elapsed During Emergence:** 9 Hours, 34 Minutes
> 
> **Report:** The seventh emergence event yielded yet another stillborn instance of SCP-3578-A despite vital signs being much stronger than previous instances. During the autopsy, it was revealed that this instance possessed all vital organs and a complete circulatory system, although these were poorly formed and the instance would have died shortly after being born had it been born alive. In terms of appearance, this instance had the basic shape of a human baby albeit with no skin, distinctive features, or skeletal structure.
> 
> An apparatus is currently being constructed to hold SCP-3578 that will provide stability and structural support in the hopes that it may encourage better development and potentially allow for cesarean section operations to be performed in order to remove future instances of SCP-3578-A while their vital signs are still strong.

> 
> **Length of Gestation:** 12 Months, 30 Days
> 
> **Time Elapsed During Emergence:** 13 Hours, 32 Minutes
> 
> **Report:** The eleventh emergence event resulted in the first live birth of an instance of SCP-3578-A. However, the specimen expired almost immediately despite all attempts by medical staff to keep it alive. The autopsy revealed a nearly complete respiratory system and a very frail and incomplete skeletal structure with the beginnings of facial features on the skull, although no joints were found. All organs were very well formed within this instance, and as such it has been decided that a cesarean section operation will be utilized in an attempt to recover a live instance of SCP-3578-A during the next gestation cycle when vital signs and development are sufficient. 
> 
> Regarding the appearance of this instance, it would seem that they are becoming more and more like that of a human, although DNA testing shows very few genetic similarities. The DNA sequencing of SCP-3578-A instances does change from instance to instance, though, and it has been theorized that SCP-3578 may be attempting to replicate the human genome. The reasons for this remain unknown.

> __**SCP-3578-A-12 Log**__
> 
> **Date:** September ██, 197█
> 
> **Researcher Overseeing Event:** Dr. Rickard Atlas
> 
> **Time Elapsed Since Previous Emergence:** 4 Months, 27 Days
> 
> **Length of Gestation:** 11 Months, 0 Days
> 
> **Time Elapsed During Emergence:** 10 Hours, 41 Minutes
> 
> **Report:** After extensive testing and examination along with careful monitoring revealed that the vital signs and development of SCP-3578-A-12 were at the highest they would likely be during this gestation period, a cesarean section operation was performed by the medical team headed by Dr. Cassandra Allexis and SCP-3578-A-12 was successfully removed from SCP-3578. Due to the lack of a nasal or oral opening, the team operated on SCP-3578-A-12 and managed to open its oral and nasal passages to allow the specimen to breathe normally.
> 
> Once SCP-3578-A-12 seemed to be stable, the umbilical cord connecting it to SCP-3578 was severed. SCP-3578-A-12 immediately began to twitch violently and struggled to take a full breath, crying incessantly while the team attempted to keep it alive. Dr. Allexis attempted to soothe the specimen by picking it up and cradling it, which effectively calmed SCP-3578-A-12 down and stabilized its breathing. Attempting to put the instance down or have another member of the medical team hold it resulted in the vital signs of SCP-3578-A-12 becoming unstable and caused it to start crying again, leading researchers to believe that SCP-3578-A-12 may have imprinted on Dr. Allexis. A selection of preprepared nutritional formulas were utilized in order to feed SCP-3578-A-12 and were met with great success, as the instance took to them very quickly when Dr. Allexis attempted to feed it.
> 
> Unfortunately, 2 hours and 13 minutes after SCP-3578-A-12 was removed from SCP-3578, its breathing became shallow and its organs began to fail. Despite many attempts to combat this, SCP-3578-A-12 expired 24 minutes later and its body was taken for examination. The autopsy revealed a more fully formed skeletal structure, although there were still no joints and no signs of appendages such as hands or feet. Following its expiration, Dr. Allexis became uncharacteristically depressed and mourned the loss of SCP-3578-A-12, leading researchers to suspect that SCP-3578-A instances may form a psychological bond with whoever they imprint on. Following this event, it has been decided that further cesarean section operations will not take place until instances of SCP-3578-A prove to be fully developed and capable of survival outside of SCP-3578 without assistance.

> __**SCP-3578-A-19 Log**__
> 
> **Date:** January ██, 198█
> 
> **Researcher Overseeing Event:** Dr. Charles Atlas
> 
> **Time Elapsed Since Previous Emergence:** 3 Months, 8 Days
> 
> **Length of Gestation:** 10 Months, 29 Days
> 
> **Time Elapsed During Emergence:** 8 Hours, 41 Minutes
> 
> **Report:** SCP-3578-A-19 is the first instance of SCP-3578-A that emerged nearly fully developed and with continuous stable vital signs. This instance possessed fully formed organs, respiratory system, circulatory system, skeletal structure, and a thin pink leathery skin covering its body, although it did not possess eyes nor eye sockets. It was physically very similar to that of a two-year-old human child in terms of body shape and facial structure and possessed female reproductive organs, although it was still very different in terms of DNA and overall appearance.
> 
> Upon emerging, SCP-3578-A-19 acted very much like a human infant and imprinted on Dr. Amanda Reynolds immediately upon being picked up. Dr. Reynolds then took SCP-3578-A-19 into the adjacent containment chamber and fed SCP-3578-A-19 using the preprepared nutritional formula. SCP-3578-A-19 did not react well to being put down in the provided crib, crying constantly and being unable to fall asleep unless held by Dr. Reynolds. Aware that this would likely happen due to results from previous live instances of SCP-3578-A, Dr. Reynolds was then designated as SCP-3578-B and became the full-time caretaker of SCP-3578-A-19 with help from the medical team.
> 
> Much like the previous live instances of SCP-3578-A, SCP-3578-A-19 expired in its sleep 8 days after its emergence due to organ failure. The autopsy found nothing wrong with SCP-3578-A-19, revealing that its body had simply given up and stopped functioning for unknown reasons. Given the fully developed state of SCP-3578-A-19, its body was taken to cryostorage for further study and analysis.

> __**SCP-3578-A-25 Log**__
> 
> **Date:** March ██, 199█
> 
> **Researcher Overseeing Event:** Dr. Charles Atlas
> 
> **Time Elapsed Since Previous Emergence:** 2 Months, 10 Days
> 
> **Length of Gestation:** 11 Months, 24 Days
> 
> **Time Elapsed During Emergence:** 17 Hours, 53 Minutes
> 
> **Report:** SCP-3578-A-25 emerged from SCP-3578 without issue and only minimal assistance from the medical team. This instance was the first to emerge with eyes, although it seemed to be blind due to its lack of reaction to visual stimulus. SCP-3578-A-25 imprinted on Dr. Janette Crawford and the two were moved to the adjacent containment chamber after severing the umbilical cord.
> 
> This instance of SCP-3578-A was the first to show any sign of awareness regarding its surroundings, having far more complex reactions to audio and physical stimulus. SCP-3578-A-25 appeared very calm when spoken to softly and handled carefully and reacted in a fearful manner to loud sounds and pinching. This is a drastic change when compared to previous instances, none of which were able to differentiate between gentle and harsh stimulus.
> 
> Over the course of the next few weeks, SCP-3578-A-25 began to show signs of further development outside of SCP-3578. This was the first time that an instance of SCP-3578-A survived long enough to display any growth before expiring. It grew out light hairs from the top of its head and its skin tightened up and softened significantly compared to its initial wrinkled leathery skin. SCP-3578-A-25 was female like all of its predecessors, and after two weeks it appeared to be very similar to a six-month-old human child in terms of appearance, the only differences being its bright pink skin, bony appearance, elongated limbs, small skull, and various discrepancies in its facial structure.
> 
> 27 days after its emergence, SCP-3578-A-25's vitals started dropping and nearly all of its organs began to fail. Despite attempts at surgery and treatment, SCP-3578-25 eventually expired and the autopsy could not find a cause. Dr. Janette Crow, having acted as SCP-3578-B while SCP-3578-A-25 was alive, reacted very poorly to this and had to be put on leave from her duties and undergo extensive psychiatric care. This is the first time that the grief felt by SCP-3578-B designated individuals after the expiration of the SCP-3578-A instance in their care resulted in long-term emotional trauma.
> 
> Also worth noting is the fact that SCP-3578 reacted to the expiration of SCP-3578-A-25 as well. During the 13 hour period in which medical staff attempted to save SCP-3578-A-25, SCP-3578 appeared to convulse and tremble in a manner that had not been witnessed before. Once SCP-3578-A-25's vitals stopped completely, SCP-3578 began showing decreased activity and far more sporadic and irregular menstrual cycles.

> __**SCP-3578-A-29/30 Log**__
> 
> **Date:** July ██, 199█
> 
> **Researcher Overseeing Event:** Dr. Charles Atlas
> 
> **Time Elapsed Since Previous Emergence:** 5 Months, 19 Days
> 
> **Length of Gestation:** 11 Months, 2 Days
> 
> **Time Elapsed During Emergence:** 37 Hours, 46 Minutes
> 
> **Report:** This was the first time that SCP-3578 developed a pair of SCP-3578-A instances simultaneously, and is thought to be a random occurrence much like any conception of twins. SCP-3578 endured severe physical exhaustion and appeared to be in pain during the entirety of SCP-3578-A-29 and SCP-3578-A-30's emergence. This emergence resulted in the first live instance of SCP-3578-A since SCP-3578-A-25. Both instances were comparatively very poorly developed, however, and one of the instances, SCP-3578-29, was stillborn.
> 
> SCP-3578-A-30 did not imprint on any of the staff chosen to be potential SCP-3578-B designated individuals nor did it accept any of the nutritional formulas, leading it to only survive for 6 hours before eventually expiring. Unlike previous instances, the cry of SCP-3578-A-30 was almost identical to the cry of a human child unlike the animal-like whining of previous instances. Autopsies of both instances revealed multiple malformed organs and poor internal development.

**Addendum 3578.2:** Emergence of SCP-3578-A-31/Expiration of SCP-3578

Following the expiration of SCP-3578-A-30, SCP-3578 had no further menstrual cycles and had very poor vital signs. While it was uncertain what exactly was wrong with SCP-3578, it seemed to be very sick and needed constant medical examinations and care following this event. For the next 23 months, SCP-3578 was considered effectively neutralized and it was not expected to produce any further instances of SCP-3578-A.

20 months after the emergence of SCP-3578-A-29 and SCP-3578-A-30 and the expiration of the latter, SCP-3578 developed a severe blood infection. Standard treatment and medication proved to be entirely ineffective, and due to the lack of blood supply of the same type as SCP-3578 to provide a transfusion, it seemed likely that SCP-3578 would not survive. After consulting with the O5 council and gaining the approval of O5-██ and O5-██, Dr. Charles Atlas was given permission to perform a blood transfusion using human blood in order to attempt to cure SCP-3578.

Dr. Isaac Ruxton was chosen by Dr. Charles Atlas to be the source of blood after testing of on-site staff volunteers showed his blood to be free of any irregularities and the fact that his family had no history of any diseases or medical conditions. After a sufficient amount of blood was collected from Dr. Ruxton, an exchange transfusion was carried out in an attempt to rid SCP-3578 of its ailment.

SCP-3578 reacted very well to the transfusion and recovered quickly, unexpectedly returning to the state of health it was in prior to the expiration of SCP-3578-25. Very soon after the transfusion, SCP-3578 began regular menstrual cycles and eventually a new instance of SCP-3578-A began to develop inside of it.

> __**SCP-3578-A-31 Log**__
> 
> **Date:** September ██, 199█
> 
> **Researcher Overseeing Event:** Dr. Charles Atlas
> 
> **Time Elapsed Since Previous Emergence:** 36 Months, 24 Days
> 
> **Length of Gestation:** 12 Months, 30 Days
> 
> **Time Elapsed During Emergence:** 13 Hours, 25 Minutes
> 
> **Report:** SCP-3578-A-31 showed consistently healthy vital signs all throughout its development inside of SCP-3578 as well as the highest level development of any SCP-3578-A instance up until this point. Upon emerging, medical teams were alarmed to find that SCP-3578-A-31 was physically identical to a four-year-old human female and was perfectly developed, although it still behaved like an infant albeit with superior motor skills. Unlike previous instances, it would not imprint on any chosen SCP-3578-B suited members of staff nor accept any nutritional formula and reacted adversely to the touch of any member of personnel.
> 
> At Dr. Atlas's request, Dr. Ruxton was retrieved and brought to the containment chamber adjacent to the one housing SCP-3578 where SCP-3578-A-31 was being kept. Upon being introduced to the chamber, SCP-3578-A-31 immediately attempted to move towards Dr. Ruxton who was then instructed to pick up SCP-3578-A-31. SCP-3578-A-31 began to calm down once Dr. Ruxton picked it up, and after sitting down he was able to feed SCP-3578-A-31 without issue.
> 
> Following this event, Dr. Ruxton was then designated as SCP-3578-B for SCP-3578-A-31 and, as hypothesized by Dr. Charles Atlas upon learning of the initial development of SCP-3578-A-31, DNA testing revealed that SCP-3578-A-31 is biologically related to Dr. Ruxton. Regular testing and examinations were done to make sure SCP-3578-A-31 remained healthy and after 60 days it was determined that this instance would survive indefinitely if given proper care and nurture. 

After the emergence of SCP-3578-A-31, SCP-3578's vitals once again began to fall and it began to physically deteriorate at a rapid rate, although none of this was as aggressive in nature as before. SCP-3578 expired on November ██, 199█, 32 days after SCP-3578-A-31 emerged, despite the efforts made by the medical team to keep it alive.

**Addendum 3578.3:** SCP-3578-A-31

**The following report contains all important information regarding SCP-3578-A-31, known unofficially as Clara Ruxton-Crawford**

Following the emergence of SCP-3578-A-31 and Dr. Isaac Ruxton's designation as SCP-3578-B, the two were moved to a 10m x 10m Standard Humanoid Containment Chamber suited to fit the needs of both individuals. Dr. Janette Crawford, a previous SCP-3578-B, volunteered to help aid Dr. Ruxton in caring for SCP-3578-A-31 after Dr. Ruxton stated that he was having a difficult time doing so alone.

Despite SCP-3578-A-31's aversion to all other members of on-site staff other than Dr. Ruxton, it took to Dr. Crawford very quickly when she had visited it once before. As such, Site Director Oliver J. Matthews approved of Dr. Crawford's involvement and allowed her to care for SCP-3578-A-31 in shifts with Dr. Ruxton. While it is uncertain why, it was later found that SCP-3578-A-31 had imprinted on Dr. Crawford as well, as Dr. Crawford now felt compelled to care for SCP-3578-A-31 and could not properly focus on her other tasks when away from SCP-3578-A-31. Once this was discovered, Dr. Crawford was designated as SCP-3578-B-2 and the containment chamber was renovated to accommodate her as well

SCP-3578-A-31 developed very quickly when compared to a human of its age, reaching the physical appearance of a six-year-old human in less than six months and mentally maturing rapidly until its intelligence matched that of its physical appearance by human standards. SCP-3578-A-31 inherited many of Dr. Ruxton's physical traits such as blue eyes and blond hair, and they bear a striking resemblance to one another. Despite its similarities to a human and its genetic relation to Dr. Ruxton, though, SCP-3578-A-31's DNA is not that of a human. It doesn't seem to be aware of this, however, and it has not been informed of its non-human origin. 

Once it learned how to speak, SCP-3578-A-31 began referring to Dr. Ruxton as 'Father' and Dr. Crawford as 'Mom', and once it grew accustomed to the other personnel it began referring to Dr. Charles Atlas as 'Grandpa'. Even though they had been advised not to treat SCP-3578-A-31 as a human, Dr. Ruxton and Dr. Crawford gave SCP-3578-A-31 the name 'Clara Ruxton-Crawford' and exclusively refer to SCP-3578-A-31 by this name rather than its SCP designation. This name is now used by all on-site staff after it was decided that treating SCP-3578-A-31 as non-human was impacting its development and causing significant distress.

Despite many attempts to separate Dr. Ruxton and Dr. Crawford from SCP-3578-A-31 for long periods of time, the psychological bond formed between them prevents them from focusing on anything else if SCP-3578-A-31 desires/requires their presence and they feel compelled to return to SCP-3578-A-31 in order to meet its needs. Regarding the two doctors, despite the two of them being chosen by SCP-3578-A-31 to be its parental figures, the two maintain a platonic relationship and their shared bond with SCP-3578-A-31 does not seem to influence romantic tendencies towards one another.

SCP-3578-A-31 reached the physical and mental age of an eight-year-old after another 10 months and as of January ██, 200█ it has entered a growth pattern identical to that of a human being.

**Edit:** As of September ██, 200█, the psychological bond between SCP-3578-A-31 and both Dr. Isaac Ruxton and Dr. Janette Crawford diminished greatly and it was found that SCP-3578-A-31 could function without a constant supply of care and affection. Both researchers also found that they were able to remain parted from SCP-3578-A-31 for long periods of time without feeling compelled to return to it. Dr. Ruxton and Dr. Crawford have since returned to their previous duties and SCP-3578-A-31 has been moved to a new containment chamber suited to its needs. At the request of Dr. Ruxton and Dr. Crawford, they have been put in charge of the continued research and study of SCP-3578-A-31 and are allowed to maintain their previous roles at the parental figures of SCP-3578-A-31 despite no longer being designated as SCP-3578-B.

**Addendum 3578.3-B:** Interview with Dr. Charles Atlas

Despite countless attempts to question SCP-3578-A-31 about its origin, it has never shown any sign that it knew anything other than what it has learned after emerging from SCP-3578. However, on the third anniversary of its emergence, September ██, 200█, SCP-3578-A-31 asked Dr. Ruxton if it could speak to Dr. Rickard Atlas and Dr. Charles Atlas, despite the former having passed away over a decade prior and never having been mentioned to SCP-3578-A-31. Dr. Charles Atlas agreed to meet with SCP-3578-31, and the following interview was held two days later.

> **Interviewed:** SCP-3578-A-31

> 
> **Dr. Atlas:** //(Clears throat)// Hello sweet-pea, how are you doing this morning?
> 
> **SCP-3578-A-31:** I'm good, Grandpa! How are you?
> 
> **Dr. Atlas:** //(Chuckles)// I'm very well, thank you. So, I heard you have something important to tell me?
> 
> **SCP-3578-A-31:** Yes! But I gotta tell to Mr. Rickard, too! Is he coming?
> 
> **Dr. Atlas:** Well, I'm sorry Clara, but he is unable to join us. My father passed away quite some time ago, you see. How did you hear about him, anyways?
> 
> //(SCP-3578-A-31 looks slightly distressed upon hearing about the late Dr. Rickard Atlas)//
> 
> **SCP-3578-A-31:** Well, Mother told me. She said it was reeeaaally important that I say thank you to both of you for her...
> 
> **Dr. Atlas:** Mother? Do you mean Dr. Crawford?
> 
> **SCP-3578-A-31:** Nuh-uh, my real Mother.
> 
> **Dr. Atlas:** And who would that be? When did they tell you to say this?
> 
> //(SCP-3578-A-31 fidgets in its seat)//
> 
> **SCP-3578-A-31:** The one who, um... The one who made me! I dunno when she told me, I just remembered that a long time ago she asked if I could say thanks for her.
> 
> **Dr. Atlas:** Well, what exactly did she want you to thank us for?
> 
> **SCP-3578-A-31:** She said that she was very grateful that you and Mr. Rickard and everyone else tried soooo //(Spreads arms)// hard to help all of my siblings, and that she is happy that you helped her to have me!
> 
> **Dr. Atlas:** //(Pauses)// Is that so?
>
