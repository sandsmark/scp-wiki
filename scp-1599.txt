**Item #**: SCP-1599

**Object Class**: Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures**: After several attempts by SCP-1599 to escape it has been locked in a 3m by 3m ceramic vault coated in a layer of EMI/RFI shielding.  The locking mechanism is manual and composed of magnetically inert materials.  

Rubber gloves are to be worn by personnel in the event that SCP-1599 must be handled. 

All personnel within 5 (five) meters of SCP-1599 must conceal their Foundation identification badges.

**Description**: SCP-1599 is a black ceramic disk 30 cm in diameter and 15 cm thick. Panels in the bottom of the disk open to deploy 6 jointed limbs, and the broken remnants of 2 other limbs. When SCP-1599 is at rest, these legs are undetectable.  By means currently unknown, SCP-1599 can produce high-resolution animated holograms, and speak.

These holograms are primarily of attractive human men or women, all of whom are 30 cm tall and have spiral horns similar to those of bighorn sheep (//Ovis canadensis//); when questioned about this, SCP-1599 states that 30 cm is "a better size", and denies that any such horns feature in the holograms. However, SCP-1599 is also able to produce holograms of any size, of any individual it has encountered (albeit with spiral horns).

SCPS-1599's speech issues from a slot in the disk (this slot is not detectable when the disk); however, the holograms "lip-synch" with the speech, providing the illusion that they are speaking.

SCP-1599 is also able to gain knowledge of any individual whose skin touches its surface.  The mechanism and extent of this ability are as yet undetermined; however, SCP-1599 will use any knowledge it acquires to try to convince personnel to assist it in escaping, by appealing to greed, lust, and fear. Direct physical contact is not advised except under testing conditions.

After 40 hours of operation SCP-1599 expresses the need to sleep and enters a dormant state for exactly 11 hours.  During this time it is safe to handle the object for examination purposes, but direct physical contact should still be avoided. Radiographic and ultrasonic analysis of the disk at rest indicate that it is solid ceramic with no internal features.
