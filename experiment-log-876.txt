title:Experiment Log 876
//The following experiments regard the effects of [[[SCP-876]]]//

**Experiment Log 876-A-1**

**Date:** ██-██-██
**Procedure:** D-class personnel instructed to swallow one pill from SCP-876-1 (hydrogen), followed by one from SCP-876-2 (helium).
**Results:** Instant explosive decompression, spreading mass amounts of dust. No organic material discovered in the debris, but small amounts of graphite and [REDACTED] found.

**Experiment Log 876-A-2**

**Date:** ██-██-██
**Procedure:** D-class personnel instructed to swallow one pill from SCP-876-2 (helium), followed by one from SCP-876-1 (hydrogen).
**Results:** No effect.

**Experiment Log 876-A-3**

**Date:** ██-██-██
**Procedure:** D-class personnel instructed to swallow one pill from SCP-876-18 (argon), followed by one from SCP-876-1 (hydrogen).
**Results:** Subject lapsed into a coughing fit. Hydrogen content of surrounding air found to be increased post-experiment.
**Notes:** //It apparently treats the contents of the victim's lungs as part of the body. -Dr. ████//

**Experiment Log 876-A-4**

**Date:** ██-██-██
**Procedure:** D-class personnel instructed to swallow a small, steel ball bearing. Following that, D-class was instructed to swallow one pill from SCP-876-26 (iron), followed by one from SCP-876-79 (gold).
**Results:** Subject immediately collapsed and expired, as expected. Dissection of the stomach revealed the steel ball to have converted into a gold-colored ball.
**Notes:** //Stomach, too? This has potential. -Dr. ████//

**Experiment Log 876-A-5**

**Date:** ██-██-██
**Procedure 1:** D-class personnel anesthetized and the stomach cut open. One SCP-876-1 pill (hydrogen) added to the stomach and observed. 
**Result 1:** The pill did not dissolve in stomach acids.
**Procedure 2:** Robotic arm used to lift SCP-876-2 (helium) pill and insert it into D-class's stomach. High-speed camera used for observation.
**Result 2:** Both pills disappeared approximately 0.01 seconds before conversion and the resulting explosive decompression.

**Experiment Log 876-A-6**

**Date:** ██-██-██
**Procedure:** Pill extracted from SCP-876-1 (hydrogen), then bisected with a laser.
**Results:** Small puff of yellow flames, signaling a reaction between hydrogen and oxygen.

**Experiment Log 876-A-7**

**Date:** ██-██-██
**Procedure:** Pill extracted from SCP-876-92 (uranium), then bisected with a laser.
**Results:** Geiger counter detected no amount of uranium in the pill.
**Notes:** //Why does it only do this for radioactive elements? -Dr. ████//

**Experiment Log 876-A-8**
**Procedure:** One half of pill used in experiment 876-A-6 welded to one half of pill used in 876-A-7. Resulting capsule is similar in appearance to pills from SCP-876-█ and SCP-876-██. D-class personnel instructed to swallow the gold ball from 876-A-4, followed by a capsule from SCP-876-79 (gold) and then the new pill.
**Results:** D-class doubled over in pain and promptly fell unconscious. Geiger counters detected a concentrated source of radioactivity inside D-class, suggesting [DATA EXPUNGED]
**Notes:** //Holy crap, I think we broke 876. -Dr. ████//

**Experiment Log 876-A-9**
**Procedure:** One pill from SCP-876-40 (zirconium) and one from SCP-876-80 (mercury) placed side-by-side, colors aligned. Capsules are visually identical, colors █████ and ██████. Both pills placed under a microscope.
**Results:** Despite extensive analysis, no difference between the pills could be visually determined. Identities of pills were not recorded, so --it is not known which corresponds to which element-- See Experiment Log 876-A-10.
**Notes:** //Pay attention to which one is which next time. -Dr. ████//

**Experiment Log 876-A-10**
**Procedure 1:** Unidentified pills from Experiment 876-A-9 were weighed.
**Result 1:** Significant discrepancy in mass. This is attributed to a difference in density of the contents. 
**Procedure 2:** Mercury-zirconium amalgam administered to D-class. Heavier pill administered, followed by lighter pill. D-class then sedated and stomach dissected to retrieve amalgam.
**Result 2:** Amalgam changed into a lump of zirconium.
