**Synopsis**
//On ██-██-████, [[[drclef-member-page|Dr. A. Clef]]] made the following recommendation on the log re: [[[SCP-239]]]//

> //My analysis of the situation has led me to the conclusion that SCP-239 is an unacceptable containment and security risk. Although several proposals have been made re: using her for containing other SCPs, the example of [[[SCP-953]]] and others must serve as a stark reminder of the risks of underestimating the Foundation's ability to control SCPs with reality-altering powers.//
> 
> //I would therefore like to make the following proposal: a dagger will be constructed of [[[SCP-148]]], capable of penetrating SCP-239's otherwise invincible skin. This weapon will be used to terminate SCP-239 while she is asleep and her powers are neutralized. Because of the danger of SCP-239 awakening and resisting termination, it is my recommendation that the selected operative carry [[[SCP-668]]] as well, in order to minimize complications.//
> 
> //One of the dangers of this procedure is the possibility that SCP-239 will awaken and perceive the operative as a friend or "good person," thus changing reality to match. It is for this reason that I would like to volunteer to carry out the procedure personally. A review of my personnel file should indicate that my [DATA EXPUNGED] should allow me to carry out the operation even after a reality shift of this nature.//
> 
> //- Clef//

//Unfortunately, Dr. Clef made the error of transmitting his proposal// en clair //instead of through secured channels. Knowledge of his plan of action reached several staff members at Site-17. As documented under [[incident-report-239-a|Incident Report 239-A]]], SCP-239 had formed bonds with several staff members at Site-17. Whether motivated by ordinary sympathy or, as Clef predicted, due to SCP-239's reality-altering abilities causing those on site to be perceived as friends, several staff members were motivated to take action to prevent Dr. Clef from carrying out his proposed plan of action: in particular, [[[dr-kondraki-s-personnel-file|Dr. ████████ Kondraki]]].//

//Evidence relating to the resulting incident is, unfortunately, incomplete and unclear at best. Efforts are currently underway to piece together the events that occurred through personal logs, official records, and post-incident interviews.//
