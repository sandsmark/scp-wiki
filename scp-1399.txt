**Item #:** SCP-1399

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1399 is to be kept on a plain wooden desk in the middle of a locked room, open to the last page, with a camera observing it at all times. If the page is observed to change in any way, follow outlined procedures.

**Description:** SCP-1399 is a thin, fifteen page children’s book titled “Another Way of Hearing.” The cover depicts the earth, with the title above it. There is no author indicated on the cover. SCP-1399’s ISBN number correlates to no assigned ISBN number, and its labeled publisher, Detiskia Books, corresponds to no recognized publishing company. 

When read sequentially, one page at a time in its entirety, it consists of a variety of disconnected visual images that have strongly associated auditory connections, along with the words “Another Way of Hearing [Image]”. Page three, for instance, is an image of a train, below which are the words “Another Way of Hearing Trains.” All of the pages, save for the last one, have not changed while within Foundation hands.

The anomalous effect of the book occurs once the last page is turned and the book closed: immediately, the reader ceases to be able to receive any auditory stimuli from the real world. Instead, their eardrums will resonate and react to what has been determined as the sounds of an alternate world. This effect extends only to hearing, with sight, touch, taste and smell apparently unaffected.

It has been determined that the particular alternate universe to which the book attunes its reader is dependent on the last page, which changes periodically. All readers who experience the effect between changes have been determined to be hearing the same world. A list of recorded diversions and related images can be found in Document-1399A.

The last page so far has appeared to change at the same time as a variety of major world-altering events occur. The book seems to re-attune people’s hearing to a world where that event occurred differently, usually in a catastrophically negative way.

This phenomenon has been noted to create considerable distress among D-class personnel due to disorientation from a difference in auditory and visual stimuli: for this reason it is advised to use blind D-class personnel when possible. D-class personnel subjected to the effects of SCP-1399 are exempt from monthly terminations until all possible acoustic mapping of the particular alternate reality has been completed.
