**Description:** 

SCP-053 appears to be a small three year old girl. She is capable of basic speech and appears to be slightly above average in mental development. She has a generally pleasant personality and rarely seems upset, becoming agitated only in the presence of groups of people. 

Any and all humans over the age of three making eye contact, physically touching, or remaining around SCP-053 for longer then ten minutes will rapidly become irrational, paranoid and homicidal. Most, if not all of these feelings will be directed at SCP-053, and afflicted subjects will attempt to kill SCP-053 after first killing or driving off all humans visible to them. Those attempting to kill SCP-053 will suffer massive heart attacks or seizure and die seconds after doing any physical damage to SCP-053. SCP-053 will regenerate almost instantaneously from any wound, regardless of severity. 

SCP-053 appears wholly ignorant of this effect, and ignores any and all subjects affected. When questioned about the effect, SCP-053 is incapable of response.
