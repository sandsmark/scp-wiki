Goddamn, who the hell ordered this? This is a slow day for us. Hell, I think I’ll do that tomorrow.
//- Dr. Bright//

Dr. Bridge, I’m quite disappointed with you. You should know that Site 19 is quite generous with employee freedom. I expect a full discourse on your reasoning for this course of action within the week. 
//- Dr. Gears//

What’s the world coming to. Can’t even enjoy some [[[SCP-420-J| 420-J]]] before work without someone getting bent out of shape. What’s next? Decommissioning Lambda-2? I’m gonna have to talk to someone about this. 
//- Dr. Clef//

Burns is a valuable member of the medical staff. I’m going to have to appeal this bullshit.
//- Dr. Mann//

Hah, this was fun to watch. Shame about Burns though.
//- Agent Spoon//

A //termination order//? Since when were Site 19 administration this Orwellian with discipline? God damn. I’d better hurry up with the party this weekend. Clef, you and the girls still coming?
//- Agent Yoric//

Depends if a certain wet blanket feels like dropping by. Screw you, Bridge.
//- Dr. Clef//

This is ridiculous. It was a nice break watching Burns go off on Light like that. She wasn’t even upset. What’s the big deal?
//- Mister Flames//
    
There isn’t any need to pick on the newbie, Clef. He just isn’t used to the way things are here yet.
//- Kain//

I had nothing to do with this. It’s all on you, Bridge.
//- Dr. Light// 

This won’t mean I have to stop drinking on job. Who is this Dr. Bridge? 
//- Agent Strelnikov//

Disciplinary request denied. Welcome to Site 19, Dr. Bridge. For wasting time and effort on this petty report I'm having you assigned as Dr. Burns' temporary assistant until ██/██/2011. Get used to it.
