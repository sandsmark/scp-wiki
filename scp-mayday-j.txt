**Item #:** SCP-MAYDAY-J

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-MAYDAY-J must be kept out of any room where staff are currently creating or updating SCP documents on a computer. SCP-MAYDAY-J is capable of opening doors, so doors must be locked if any work is to be done. In the event SCP-MAYDAY-J is able to enter a room where computer work is being done, it should be distracted with treats or cuddles until it can be removed from the area. 

SCP-MAYDAY-J is allowed to wander Site-726. A litterbox and food/water dishes have been placed in the site's cafeteria for it. During down time or off hours, personnel are encouraged to play with SCP-MAYDAY-J for relaxation and morale purposes. 

**Description:** SCP-MAYDAY-J is a female stray cat that Dr. Loyd brought to Site-726 on the 18th of August, 2012. It has black fur, with the exception of a few white tufts of hair on its chest, and is currently quite overweight. Staff are reminded not to feed SCP-MAYDAY-J scraps from the cafeteria. SCP-MAYDAY-J is very friendly and playful. Staff have described it as "always acting like a kitten." Staff generally refer to it as 'Mayday' or 'Mayd' for short. 

SCP-MAYDAY-J is generally non-anomalous; however, when an SCP Foundation staff member begins to create a new SCP document or edit a pre-existing one, it will anomalously become aware of this and attempt to enter the area where the document is being prepared. If SCP-MAYDAY-J is able to do this, it will try to disrupt the work being done in any way it can. SCP-MAYDAY-J has been observed knocking items off the desk, blocking the computer screen, stepping on the keyboard, and generally acting like a nuisance. 

**Addendum:** Below is a list of documents that SCP-MAYDAY-J has affected:
* [[[SCP-1504]]] - "Joe Schmo," a particularly durable man who's every action is misperceived as normal. 
 * SCP-MAYDAY-J caused Reasearcher Vanderbilt to accidently delete the pre-existing documentation, by pushing his hand controlling the mouse in an attempt to get scratches.
* [[[who-am-i | Who am I?]]] - Ongoing reasearch into the true nature of SCP-431.
 * SCP-MAYDAY-J knocked an open bottle over, spilling water onto Dr. Loyd's desk and keyboard. The keyboard stopped functioning, so work on the above document was stalled for several minutes. 
* [[[scp-2579 |SCP-2579]]] - "Grant's Bears," a species of bear that is able to anonymously produce music and will dance to it when trying to find a mate
 * SCP-MAYDAY-J attempted to enter the room where the document was being prepared. As the door was locked, it instead howled and meowed loudly, annoying and distracting Researcher Vanderbilt.
* [[[scp-3002 |SCP-3002]]] - "Attempts to Assassinate Thought," an incredibly contagious meme that manifests as a childhood friend.
 * SCP-MAYDAY-J stepped on Researcher Vanderbilt's keyboard, accidently bypassing admin locks on the anomaly's documentation, infecting Researcher Vanderbilt. 
* [[[recruitment-drive-28126 |Recruitment Drive (R-28126)]]] - A document concerning the hiring practices of GOI-019 (The Factory).
 * SCP-MAYDAY-J, strangely enough, did nothing during this research project. 
* [[[SCP-2654]]] - "1001 Arabian Snacks", a magic eight ball that will occasionally cause a strange humanoid to appear.
 * SCP-MAYDAY-J ran away with the snacks dedicated to SCP-2654-1. It was rather upset because of that.
* [[[what-am-i| What am I?]]] - A tale exploring what SCP-173 is. 
* [[[SCP-3654]]] - "WarTime", a ship from an alternate WW2.  
* [[[SCP-3254]]] - "Grant's Mama Bear", a cybernetic bear that wants to protect its children.
* [[[SCP-3540]]] - "Don't Queer the Reaper, or some other pun involving Psychopomps", A pair of grim reapers that spend the month of October celebrating Halloween and enjoying each other's companies. 
* [[[SCP-3542]]] - "Fear Not, Citizen", a reality bender who is just a really really shitty batman.
* [[[SCP-4002]]] - "The Black Moon Howls at the Edge of Time", The Myth of Etana and the deal he made. 
* [[[SCP-3541]]] - "Twice as bright", Those who know can recognize others.

[[tab Deleted Tale]]

A decently-sized group of whitecoats lounge around the table in the employee lounge at Site 281. Room 26 to be exact. A whiteboard stands behind them, with a list of names written in green marker, some crossed off or partially erased. This is the semi-regular (unofficial) D-Class tournament. A group of doctors each name a D-Class they work with regularly, and each test subject is pitted against another one. Whichever survives the longest in their respective tests advance to the next round. A morbid game indeed, but what did these doctors care? They're barely humans. More characitatures of humanity than anything.

"How'd your subject go?" The one with the ID badge reading 'Dr. Herder' asks.

"Mine actually managed to stay alive. Evidently he used to be a semi-professional staring contest winner. You?"

"Mine went inside. Still haven't found him yet. Rip in pepperonis, I guess." The others stare at him, a mixture of incredulity and confusion on their faces.

The doctor by the whiteboard wipes away Herder's name. "Alright, Herder's out, and Goethe advances. Schiller, who was your D-Class again?"

"D-952. She was actually fantastic. Veronica I think her name was. I had her do a test with [[[SCP-2521| you know, that one thing]]]. I have no idea how, but she managed to survive. [[[d-7294-s-declassified-d-class-survival-guide|Pissed off the admins though]]]."

The others nod.

"And what about you, Loyd."

The rather plain looking man sighs a bit, and looks directly at the contest organizer by the whiteboard. "I'm just here so I don't get disqualified."

And then a freak chain of events involving bad bread, attempts to brew beer in the break room, and careless smokers results in the door to the refrigerator exploding off the appliance and flying directly at Loyd. Killing him instantly.
