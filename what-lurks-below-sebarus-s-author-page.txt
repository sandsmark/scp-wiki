As I was saying, welcome, traveler. Haven't seen a lot of souls ever since they locked me down here. Why not stay a while, and listen to an old thing ramble? You don't look like you're in a hurry either, not with that leg of yours. Be careful around the edge, so you don't fall in here. It's a long way down.

Oh, why am I down here, you ask. I'm here because many choose to fear that which they don't understand, and many choose to destroy, or in my case lock away, what they fear. I have been here for a long time, so long that most souls in this facility have forgotten that I'm even here. I have had a lot of free time. Want to know what I do with that free time?

I write. With will as my quill and the fabric of reality as my canvas, I write, and my words shape reality.

[[module ListUsers users="."]]
Who's to say I'm not writing about you right now, %%title%%? Are the movements of your eyes, scanning the screen in front of you, merely dictations of mine?
[[/module]]

What? Sorry, I was just talking to another friend of mine. Do you want to see what other lives my words have molded?

"//The main anomaly of SCP-4823 is a localized trans-dimensional two-way gateway in place of fruit flesh. The gateway becomes exposed when the banana is peeled, which can only be done halfway. Upon exposure, the gateway will draw the peeler in, exposing them to a noodle effect caused by a strong non-homogenous gravitational field, in order for them to fit through.//"

This was my first skip, and it has exceeded all my wildest dreams. A bit of context: while I only became a member of the site in 2018 and active in the community in 2019, I have been an active lurker here since 2012-2013. I enjoyed reading the site, but the community always seemed distant to me somehow. The fact that I'm now part of it feels... weird, and the fact that I have produced content for it even weirder. When I made this, I was proud of just getting something on the site. I expected this to reach maybe +20, and I would have been happy with that. But, against all of my expectations, it got into the Reviewer's Spotlight (thank you [[*user Kilonova]]) and the rating just soared. After that, people have made fan art and audio adaptations and translations of it and it's just... mind blowing to me.

Oh, a few fun facts: This was actually inspired by a dumb JoJo meme posted in the WL Discord by [[*user Rounderhouse]], and every character in this skip is actually named after different banana varieties.

This was made for the first day of JamCon 2020, when the theme was "EXPLOSIONS". I wrote this in the span of maybe 4 hours in the middle of the night. It was exhausting but I'm pretty proud of how this turned out.

This was kind of a last minute post for the last theme in JamCon 2020, "More Than Meets The Eye". Wrote it in about 2 hours, and had enough time to get crit from one person, but out of my JamCon posts I'm the proudest of this one.

This is the page you're looking at right now, how trippy is that? It feels really surreal to finally have one on the site. Anyway, I decided to write the flavor text for this from the perspective of a skip, because why not. It's a little cringy, I admit, but who cares, it's just an author page.

This is a space to showcase all of the cool things that people have made out of my stuff! I appreciate all of it, and I am greatly honored that people think that my writings are worthy of making more stuff out of, so it deserves to be showcased. If you have made something and it isn't here, it probably just means that I haven't seen it. In that case, if you want it up here, feel free to DM me on either Wikidot or Discord if we share a server.
