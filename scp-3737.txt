**Item #:** SCP-3737

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** The Foundation has purchased the land that contains SCP-3737-1. Various signs have been posted around the area declaring it as federal property. Trespassers are subject to local law. Foundation personnel are authorized to visit SCP-3737 during Reunion events, so long as such a visit does not interfere with their work. 

**Description:** SCP-3737 is an inter-dimensional anomaly that manifests as a tropical island. The size of the island or the surrounding ocean has not been measured due to SCP-3737's limited accessibility. Per its anomalous nature, the island has no relative location, and exists in its own reality. 

SCP-3737-1 is the entrance to SCP-3737, located on the ████████ Bridge in ███████████, Greenland. The entrance takes the form of an unstable Einstein-Rosen spatial anomaly, which is connected to a similar anomaly on a dock on the southern portion of SCP-3737. SCP-3737-1 is typically inaccessible, but can open at highly irregular intervals.[[footnote]]Since its opening on October 6th, 2016, SCP-3737-1 has not reopened.[[/footnote]] These periods have been designated as "Reunion" events and last exactly 24 hours before SCP-3737-1 reverts to its inaccessible state. The spontaneous appearance of a wall of fog on the bridge housing SCP-3737-1 indicates a Reunion event. Passing through this wall is effectively entering SCP-3737-1. 

SCP-3737-2 is the collective designation for the inhabitants of SCP-3737, which are various species of animals commonly kept as household pets. Instances of SCP-3737-2 are all present in their adolescent age and show no indications of poor health. These entities will engage in playful activities either with each other or with the various animal toys found on SCP-3737. No aggressive or territorial behavior has been observed in SCP-3737-2 instances.

**Exploration Log 3737-1A:** Due to the rarity of its appearance, a research team was granted permission to explore the nature of SCP-3737-1 when it spontaneously opened on October 6th, 2016. A security detail was assigned as a precautionary measure. All personnel were required to wear Class-A Environmental Hazard Suits until the location at the opposite end of SCP-3737-1 (later SCP-3737) was deemed habitable. The transcript of the subsequent video has been added to this file.

> 
> //[The video is taken from the perspective of Dr. Lawrence's suit camera. The first few seconds show Dr. Lawrence behind Dr. McCall and Dr. Rostova as they approach SCP-3737-1, with Agents Crawford, Bardeux, Alexander, and Ramirez flanking.]//
> 
> **Dr. McCall:** Is everyone ready?
> 
> //[All personnel give their respective signals.]//
> 
> **Crawford:** I hope it is something interesting this time. 
> 
> **Alexander:** Hush. I just hope it doesn't kill us. 
> 
> //[The team crosses through the wall of fog. Camera feed glitches for approximately 2.4 seconds before being re-established. Frame shows the research team on SCP-3737's dock.]//
> 
> **Dr. Lawrence:** Oh thank heavens. Something normal for a change. 
> 
> **Alexander:** From what I've seen, nothing is ever normal.
> 
> **Bardeux:** Entities sighted. 
> 
> //[The frame shifts to show a group of canine SCP-3737-2 engaging with a length of rope a few feet from the dock. They appear oblivious to the presence of the team.]//
> 
> **Dr. Rostova:** I assume these are going to turn into horrific, reality-ending monsters and kill us, right? I think you should eliminate them now. 
> 
> **Ramirez:** I'm alright with that. 
> 
> **Alexander:** Affirmative. You are clear to en-
> 
> //[Dr. McCall turns to face Agent Alexander.]//
> 
> **Dr. McCall:** Now just wait a damn second. We don't know if these dogs are hostile. 
> 
> **Alexander:** Fine. Bardeux, initiate contact with the entity. 
> 
> **Bardeux:** Aye, sir. 
> 
> //[Agent Bardeux breaks away from the main group and approaches the SCP-3737-2 instances with his weapon raised. One of the instances, a male Airedale Terrier, notices Agent Bardeux and turns to face him. The other instances remain oblivious.]//
> 
> **Alexander:** If it moves in a way you don't like, shoot it.
> 
> **Bardeux:** Aye.
> 
> //[The instance moves in front of Agent Bardeux and sits. Agent Bardeux points his weapon at the entity.]//
> 
> **Bardeux:** Advise. 
> 
> **Alexander:** Hold your fire. Bardeux, initiate physical contact with the entity. Crawford, Ramirez, be ready to engage.   
> 
> //[Agent Bardeux extends his arm in front of the entity. It slowly approaches and places its head under Agent Bardeux's hand. Bardeux proceeds to rub the instance's head which causes it to pant.]//
> 
> **Dr. McCall:** That doesn't look murderous. 
> 
> **Dr. Rostova:** Still expecting it to attack him. 
> 
> **Dr. Lawrence:** Katherine, is this really the time? 
> 
> **Dr. Rostova:** What? It's a good point. Nearly half the entities we encounter are extremely hostile. Don't blame me for being cautious.
> 
> **Dr. McCall:** He sure looks cute and cuddly. 
> 
> **Dr. Rostova:** It. 
> 
> **Dr. McCall:** Here, Let me try something. 
> 
> //[Dr. McCall whistles. Several instances of SCP-3737-2 approach the team. Various species of animal are visible.]//
> 
> **Ramirez:** Did they bring the whole zoo here or something? 
> 
> **Bardeux:** This dog has a collar. 
> 
> //[Agent Bardeux investigates the collar on the SCP-3737-2 instance.]//
> 
> **Bardeux:** His name is Felix. 
> 
> //[Dr. McCall approaches the instance and begins to pet it. It rolls over onto its back, and Dr. McCall scratches its stomach.]//
> 
> **Dr. McCall:** Aw. How cute. See? They are just household pets. 
> 
> **Dr. Lawrence:** They all have collars. Who do these things belong to? 
> 
> **Alexander:** I don't know, and I don't care. Let's just get on with this. 
> 
> //[Several hours pass. The team explores several areas within SCP-3737. The island is revealed to contain several different terrains, including forests and prairies, along with more instances of SCP-3737-2.]//
> 
> **Crawford:** Has anyone noticed the sun hasn't moved since we got here? 
> 
> **Dr. Lawrence:** Perhaps it is an anomalous property of the island. Who knows?
> 
> //[An instance of SCP-3737-2, a female Boxer, appears out of a nearby bush and approaches Dr. McCall.]//
> 
> **Dr. Lawrence:** I guess she likes you. 
> 
> **Dr. McCall:** Ha, yeah I guess so. Who's a good girl, huh? What's your name?
> 
> //[Dr. McCall examines the name-tag on the instance's blue collar. He pauses for a moment.]//
> 
> **Dr. Rostova:** Is everything alright, Ludwig? 
> 
> **Dr. McCall:** Yeah, yeah. It's just that uh...
> 
> **Alexander:** Just that what, Doctor? 
> 
> **Dr. McCall:** Her name is Gypsy. 
> 
> **Dr. Rostova:** And? 
> 
> **Dr. McCall:** I had a Boxer/Lab mix that I grew up with. Her name was Gypsy. 
> 
> **Dr. Rostova:** So? I'm sure a lot of dogs are named Gypsy. What makes you think this one is her? 
> 
> **Dr. McCall:** Gypsy also had a blue collar. 
> 
> //[Dr. McCall begins to remove his suit. Upon removing his mask, the SCP-3737-2 instance hunches down on the floor and proceeds to jump onto Dr. McCall, licking his face.]//
> 
> **Dr. Lawrence:** I remember you talking about Gypsy. I thought she died? 
> 
> **Dr. McCall:** //[Speaking while being viciously licked by the instance]// She did, I thought. 
> 
> **Dr Lawrence:** Then what is she doing here? 
> 
> **Dr. Rostova:** It is probably some form of cogntiohazardous bait. I don't trust-
> 
> //[Dr. Rostova is alerted when another SCP-3737-2 instance appears. She turns to face a male Siamese Cat wearing a black collar.]//
> 
> **Dr. Rostova:** That's...That's not possible.
> 
> **Dr. Lawrence:** What is it, Katherine?  
> 
> //[Dr. Rostova approaches the instance, and also removes her suit. She grabs the entity and holds it close to her chest, to which it begins purring. Dr. Rostova begins to cry.]//
> 
> **Bardeux:** The hell is going on here? 
> 
> **Alexander:** I have no idea. Doctor, mind explaining? 
> 
> **Dr. Rostova:** He looks just like my old Siamese. Same collar and everything. Even has his name-tag. 
> 
> **Dr. Lawrence:** Katherine, I'd be very careful. This looks just like [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3773 | 3773]]].
> 
> **Dr. Rostova:** This looks nothing like that, Vernon. Pike was batshit crazy and so was her cat.
> 
> **Alexander:** So much for murderous creatures, Dr. Rostova. 
> 
> //[Dr. Rostova spots a feather on a string, which did not show on the film prior to her arrival. She picks the stick up and proceeds to play with the SCP-3737-2 instance. Dr. McCall has ceased interactions with his SCP-3737-2 instance to respond to his earpiece.]//
> 
> **Dr. McCall:** That's odd. 
> 
> **Dr. Lawrence:** What is it, Ludwig? 
> 
> **Dr. McCall:** Reality team is reading a loss of stability in the portal. They are suggesting we return to the camp as soon as possible. 
> 
> **Ramirez:** The dock isn't that far from here. An hour or two at least. Will it hold? 
> 
> **Dr. McCall:** They are saying it'll last for another two hours before it collapses. 
> 
> **Dr. Rostova:** That's great! I'll take Jasper with me and Gypsy can come too! It'll be a fun little reunion. 
> 
> **Dr. Lawrence:** Katherine. 
> 
> **Dr. Rostova:** What is it?
> 
> **Dr. Lawrence:** You know how strict we are about dimensional entities. If you bring that back with you, you won't be able to see it. It'll be under extreme experimentation. I don't think you want it to go through that. 
> 
> **Dr. Rostova:** I can't just leave him here, Vernon. What if he gets hurt or something? I don't want him to be lonely. 
> 
> **Dr. McCall:** Katherine. He'll be with the other animals here. Trust me, he'll be okay. 
> 
> **Dr. Rostova:** He was my best friend when I was a kid. I haven't seen him in years, and you expect me to just leave him? Just like that? 
> 
> **Crawford:** Dr. Rostova, it isn't safe for you here if you stay much longer.
> 
> **Dr. Rostova:** Shut it. It's my cat- if I want to bring him, I can. I take full responsibility. What about you, Ludwig? Why aren't you happy to see Gypsy? Don't you want to have her in your life again?
> 
> **Dr. McCall:** Of course I'm happy to see her, Katherine. She was my best friend growing up as well. I would love having someone like her back, but she might not even exist. Even if she does, I don't want her going through the Foundation. That wouldn't be right. 
> 
> **Dr. Lawrence:** There are exceptions to every rule. You can try to bring her back if you-
> 
> **Dr. McCall:** It's okay, Vernon. I made my choice. Let Katherine take her cat and let's get out of here before something bad happens. 
> 
> //[Dr. Rostova carries her SCP-3737-2 instance as the research team returns to the dock. Dr. McCall's SCP-3737-2 instance has been following behind.]//
> 
> **Crawford:** Everyone accounted for? 
> 
> **Dr. Lawrence:** I think so. 
> 
> **Alexander:** Wonderful. I think this is the first time we actually had a peaceful mission. Let's get back to the camp. 
> 
> //[Dr. McCall turns and kneels in front of his SCP-3737-2 instance. He hugs the entity as it begins to whine.]//
> 
> **Dr. McCall:** I'll miss you so much. Thank you for always being there for me. Goodbye, Gypsy. I love you. 
> 
> //[The team crosses into SCP-3737-1. Dr. Rostova's SCP-3737-2 instance is no longer in her arms. Agent Crawford and Agent Bardeux restrain her as she attempts to cross back into SCP-3737-1. SCP-3737-1 then becomes unstable and closes. The fog dissipates.]//

**Addendum 3737-1B:** Investigation into the nature of SCP-3737-2 has been postponed until SCP-3737-1 becomes stable. Upon further analysis, the collar tags found on the SCP-3737-2 instances featured no extraneous information besides the name of the instance. The appearance of various pet toys in SCP-3737 is also currently being investigated. 

**Addendum 3737-2B:** Dr. Kathrine Rostova was placed into quarantine following her return under the suspicion she was suffering from memetic effects. She was released a week later after clearing several cognitohazard screenings. Dr. Rostova is to meet with Site-24's psychiatrist on a weekly basis until such a time where she is deemed emotionally stable.
