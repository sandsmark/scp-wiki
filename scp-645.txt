**Item #:** SCP-645

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-645 is to be kept inside a containment cell with dimensions of 4 meters height by .5 meters width by 4 meters length. All personnel near/around SCP-645 are to refrain from behaviors which may be considered untruthful. Those who fail to follow the aforementioned requirements are to refrain from inserting any appendage into SCP-645. SCP-645 may be transported safely by any and all personnel with Level 1 or above clearance, but it is preferable that Class D personnel be used to transport SCP-645 between locations.

SCP-645 is to be cleaned after each activation.

**Description:** SCP-645 is a large disk of Pavonazzetto marble with a humanoid face carved into it, similar to the famous //[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bocca_della_Verit%C3%A0 Bocca della Verità]// carving in the church of Santa Maria in Cosmedin in Rome, Italy. As with the Bocca carving, the 'mouth' and 'eyes' are empty holes; unlike with the Bocca carving, however, subjects who place their hands inside SCP-645's mouth describe it as 'warm' and 'moist'.

SCP-645 embodies, and has been hypothesized by Foundation folklorists to be the origin of, the "lie-detection" properties attributed to the Bocca carving since medieval times: any subject who tells a lie while their hand is within the carving's mouth will "awaken" the carving, which will then bite off and swallow the subject's hand. [See experiment log 645-31-C for parameters of what is considered a 'lie'.] The ultimate fate of these severed hands is unknown, as probes of the carving's mouth in its inert state have revealed no esophagus.

**Recovery:** SCP-645 was discovered during routine archaeological excavations in ██████, Italy, in 19██ . The slab of marble bearing the carving was not attached to any building; archaeologist ████████ ██████ expressed the opinion that it seemed to have been deliberately buried.

48 hours after being discovered, SCP-645 mutilated a graduate student who had been participating in the excavation; Foundation agents in the Italian Ministry of [REDACTED] intercepted the injury reports and retrieved the object.
