||||||||~ Initial Report||
||~ Author || Khemwer-her-Nub ||~ Date || II Akhet 13, 66th Year of the Kingship of Ramesses II ||
||~ Interest||High||~ Identifier|| Well of Rebirth ||
||||||||I, Khemwer-her-Nub, who ransoms kings and princes, who makes lead into silver and bronze into gold, whose slaves number more than the fish of the Nile, I was sent for by the great king Ramesses, who slays his enemies and honors his servants, and I was commanded to find a cure for the pains afflicting the mighty hands and proud heart of the great one. _
 _
I came out of my estates, I gathered my rowers and my sailors and my servants, I went upon the great Nile. My fifty ships were loaded with ivory, incense, grain, curse-tablets, panthers, gold, every good product. I came to Besa, the priests there greeted me, they showed me their temples and their fields. _
 _
I went into their well with Khemkehty-wer-Nebu, she who has beauty surpassing all others, my wife and my companion and my dearest one. I told her what I had to do, and she understood, and she offered herself to me. She went down into the sacred waters, she took up the aspect of Isis and I of Osiris, I spoke the incantations taught to me in my childhood so long ago, and I held her beneath me until her //ka// went from her. Age fled me, I became a young man again, I held her body and I wept into the waters, and I went down the Nile once more. _
 _
I came to the court of the Great One, I told him of what I had did and what he must do, he saw the youth upon my body and he gave me my rewards. And he went upon the Nile, he took with him his daughter-and-wife Bintanath, Lady of the Two Lands, they went into the well at the temple. And down in the well, the //ka// of the great king fled, and the Great Lady came from the well, and she was young once more. She gave unto me the well and the temples and the priests, and for her generosity I swore never to speak truthfully of the Great King's death during her life. ||

 _
The item is a nile-measuring well, in the city of Antinopolis. It can be used to restore health and youth with the sacrifice of a dear friend, a lover, or a close relative. Its primary use to the Empire is in ensuring that a good Emperor may live for much longer than he otherwise would. A constant supply of appropriate sacrifices is needed; possibly ITEM CXXXV or ITEM MXIV could be used to create love where there was none before, or the Emperor could simply be convinced to have many children with women chosen for this purpose. The Emperor Hadrian was the first to use this item, with the sacrifice of his lover Antinoüs; unfortunately, the Emperor was more attached to the boy than anticipated, and forbade the object's further use, making it into a monument for his lover. _
 _
The //Cura Praetoria Sapientae Occultae// has been made aware of the item's existence, but they do not know the proper method of use. We believe that they are unlikely to attempt to seize it, especially since they have little influence in the Eastern provinces. The priests of the temple in which the item lies are loyal to us; many of them are sorcerers of meagre ability, trained in the Egyptian and Syrian schools. The //Forum Tenebris// holds a half-share in any profits from the item, and representatives of the //Forum// with the proper letters of approval may make use of it. However, as the //Cura Praetoria// has some suspicions of the //Forum//'s involvement in our affairs, this use is to be only occasional, and those seeking to use it are to arrive and depart in absolute secrecy. _
