**Audio/Video log ██.██████**
> "Alright, let's get this done." *Sounds of liquid being poured into the rocket.*
> "The soda is in. Adding the Mentos to a napkin to hold until proper release time." *Several clicks can be heard*
> "Adding 2383 to a gel capsule and adding to rocket." *Plink Plink*
> "Alright. Let's set this up and get it ready to launch."
> "5…4…3…2-" *A sudden explosion interrupts the countdown.*
> "████ ██████!" *Shouts as the rocket flies up.*
> "GET OUT OF THE-" *Crash* "…way." Screams can be heard as the rocket flies around the testing hangar.
> "…ohgodit'scomingthiswayrunrunrunrunRUNRUNRUNRUN!" *Crash* "Oh god it hit the wall…It's going to burst!" Boom*
> "It's shooting flaming mentos! Oh god damn…the soda's on fire. How the hell did it ignite the damn soda?"
> "…that could have been worse…"

//It would appear the liquid from SCP-2383-J is not as inert as we thought. Further testing involving the addition of the liquid approved. - Dr. Aeish//

**Date:** ██/██/████
**Head Researcher:** Dr. Aeish
**Test Item(s):** D-0452, two tables with various plastic building items.
**SCP-2383-J Color:** Purple
**Test Results:** Subject placed equidistant between both tables. Upon exposure, subject quickly rushes to the table on his left, collect multiple parts, apparently at random, then proceed to experiment using the right-hand table. Resulting item is completely plastic, yet acts in a similar way to a stun-gun or Tazer, with a small reserve of SCP-2383-J utilised as a power source. Subject sedated and item stored as SCP-2383-4.

**Date:** ██/██/████
**Head Researcher:** Dr. M██████
**Test Item(s):** Dr. Aeish, table with a randomised selection of mechanical items
**SCP-2383-J Color:** Purple (liquid turned blue approximately 9 minutes into the test)
**Test Results:** Upon exposure, subject proceeded to build an item which was initially (wrongly) identified as a shotgun. Sedation completed immediately after addition of SCP-2383-J liquid, and item retrieved. Further inspection shows the item to be a folding crossbow, with automatic winding mechanism. No traces of SCP-2383-J detected, item catalogued as SCP-2383-5, and is currently stored in the research area of Dr. Aeish.
SCP-2383-5 produces it's own supply of ammunition from a small box located under the main body, SCP-2383-J liquid currently theorised to be held inside.

//I've attached the testing log. This thing is weird as hell. - Dr. Aeish//

**Testing of SCP-2383-5**
SCP-2383-5 tested at on-site firing range, against a ballistics gel dummy. Weapons technician Sgt. Deans overseeing. Any bolt number not recorded was a standard metal bolt.
//Bolt number - effect.//
> 007 - Bolt moves through ballistics gel. No damage to gel, bolt found several inches into sandbags at rear of range.
> 015 - Dummy teleports to 1543-J, 1534-J activates and launches the dummy into the Sun.
> 018 - Bolt turns into water mid-flight. Dummy reported as being "Slightly damp" by Sgt. Deans.
> 027 - Bolt appears to be made of sponge, with a jam tip. Reported as "tasty", jam identified as strawberry.
> 028 - Dummy covered in custard.
> 039 - Bolt pots the black pool ball in the staff break room. Agents using the table at the time expressed surprise, no injuries caused to either.
> 048 - Two bolts fired, however flight was stable despite proximity.
> 052 - Subject begins to glow brightly, and stands in place for about five seconds. Crossbow temporarily metamorphoizes into a golden bow and arrow. Subject draws, cocks, and fires hundreds of arrows in quick succession dispute neither carrying ammunition nor having any formal training in archery. After about 10 more seconds, subject draws a large golden arrow, and fires it at the target's "Feet", whereupon it is engulfed in a pillar of light lasting 2 more seconds. At this point, all subjects in a █ meter radius experience visual hallucinations consisting of the numbers "9999" appearing appearing at the target's location. Target then designates into fine dust, and weapon returns to original form. Recovery team later finds $█.██ in coins in place of the target.
> 054 - Bolt fails to fire. Instead, a hatch opens up, and a spring-loaded flag labeled "Bang!" unfurls.
> 058 - Dummy is immediately teleported into the chamber of SCP-682.
> 068 - Dummy is turned into well-aged cheddar cheese.
> 079 - Bolt teleports to the opposite wall, flies backward's through the dummy's abdomen, and re-loads itself into the crossbow's firing mechanism.
> 087 - Bolt becomes a smoke grenade, filling the room with an opaque, nonpoisonous gas. Moments later, Mobile Task Force Zeta-9 (Richard-Gyration) forcefully enters the firing range and open fires on the dummy. Agent claims his team received orders form O5-█ to terminate the training dummy with excessive force, though these orders were later found to be forged though unknown means.
> Further results to be added when collated. - Dr. Aeish
> 902 - Bolt impales a small kitten. CCTV does not record a kitten entering the firing range at any point.
Testing halted by Dr. Rights.

**Date:** ██/██/████
**Head Researcher:** Dr. Edison
**Test Item(s):** D-4321 (formerly a professor at ███████ █████████ University, expelled for illegal [DATA EXPUNGED]), x8 spherical bottles described by the subject as "science-y", filled with water mixed with various hues of food coloring.
**SCP-2383-J Color:** Red
**Test Results:** Subject begins to cackle madly. Bottles begin to fizz and bubble (despite being filled with water) as subject pours them into SCP-2383-J. Liquid in SCP-2383-J turns red. Procedure 2383-Rho enabled. Video footage reports the subject shouting "They said I was mad! Well I'll show them, I'LL SHOW THEM ALL!" before ingesting the liquid. Subject then explodes in a blue fireball, disintegrating D-4321 and destroying the entire building. Thankfully, all researchers survived and are accounted for as a result of Procedure 2383-Rho, and no SCPs breached containment. Upon further examination, Subject D-4321's shoes were found completely intact inside the resulting crater. New off-site testing facility requested.
