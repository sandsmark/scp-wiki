**Security Clearance:** Level 2/30,33,209,324,410

**Title:** Archival Maintenance Officer; Documentation Standards and Control 

**Location:** Office at Site 19, mobile as needed

**History:** Drafted into the Foundation Archival staff during the acquisition of [[[SCP-033]]], Agent Mulciber has previously held such illustrious positions as Junior Accounts Processor at █████, Inc., Deputy Assistant Comptroller for the city of ███████, and Document Input Intern at █████ University.  Possessing a combat capability somewhat less potent than a turnip and charisma to match, Agent Mulciber is wisely kept far from any interaction with hostile entities, friendly entities, the public, and his co-workers whenever possible.  Due to a rather severe and untreated case of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotard_delusion Cotard's Syndrome], Agent Mulciber believes himself to be physically dead.  The full scope of his delusion is unknown, but he possesses no paranormal abilities or aptitudes, and is, in fact, quite alive--as his ravenous consumption of commissary danish attests.  The delusion is indulged and left untreated primarily because one of its parameters is Agent Mulciber's strong belief that his role in the afterlife in which he now finds himself involves the organization of files and codifying of documentation; something he excels at, the Foundation is in sore need of, and no one else really wants to do on a Friday night.

Agent Mulciber's stated goal at the Foundation is to standardize the format for experiment logs, incident reports, hoax inquiries, inventory requisitions, uniform invoices and D-Class death certificate forgeries.  This, in addition to Archives' overall goal of standardizing information retrieval at each site should keep him busy if it does indeed turn out he's got eternity to finish the job.

**Note:** //Please assign some D-Class to do this guy's yearly review.  It's like going to a baby panda funeral every time I have to sit in a room and listen to him.// -Deputy Archives Manager █████-

**Note:** //Whoever's been trying to "convince" Agent Mulciber he's alive by randomly shooting at him needs to stop.  Archives is backlogged filing all his incident reports.  Sure, it's hilarious, but we've got work to do.// -Dr. ██████████
