title:Experiment Log 826
After Agent ██████ entered the room containing SCP-826 and shut the door, GPS locator and radio held by research team stationed outside the door in a room adjoining the containment chamber malfunctioned, cutting off communication to Agent ██████.  After a period of 5 minutes, Agent ██████ emerged from the door unharmed.  Agent ██████ was dropped in the middle of a prairie with a "green smudge" off to the west (presumably the Verdigris River of the book).  Agent walked towards the river for what he estimated to be an hour, before being approached by one of the main characters of the book returning from a hunting trip and invited to join him for dinner.  Agent accompanied character back to his home, a log cabin in the prairie where he met the rest of the character's family and discovered SCP-826 sitting on the mantlepiece.  When Agent pointed out SCP-826 to the other characters, they claimed SCP was not there before, but did not appear concerned about its presence.  Agent then ate dinner with the family, and afterwards asked if he could take the SCP-contained book with him.  The characters allowed him to take the book, but displayed concern about Agent traveling on the prairie at night.  Agent proceeded to remove the book from SCP-826, and exit through the cabin door into the research team's room.  Display time on watch is consistent with Agent ██████'s report that he had spent several hours in the setting.

**Addendum:** Examination of the SCP contained copy of the book reveals an additional paragraph in the book's mid-section describing Agent ██████'s visit, in language consistent with Laura Ingalls Wilder's style.  No mention is made, however, of SCP-826; Agent is simply described as having dinner and leaving.  This textual deviation appears to be unique to this copy, as other copies do not appear to contain this passage.  Book is now designated Document 826-1.  Researchers are recommended to file copies of documents used with Dr. █████████ under Document 826-(number)

**Subject:** Agent █████████
**Movie:**  //The Shining// (DVD)
**Equipment:**One (1) GPS locator, one (1) two-way radio, one (1) canteen filled with water, one (1) watch, one (1) 9mm semi-automatic with extra cartridges, one (1) video camera attached to Agent's hat
**Results:** After Agent █████████ entered SCP-containing room, GPS and radio proceeded to malfunction as in previous experiment.  After roughly 30 seconds, Agent █████████ exited the room, and gave video camera to research team.  Tape was playable and contained the following footage.

**NOTE:** A request to test SCP-701 has been tabled pending consideration of a safe experimental protocol.

>        Agent █████████ enters into a hotel room from what appeared to be a closet and, after exploring the room and confirming she could not exit through the closet, leaves the room.  \
Agent continues down hallway and eventually arrives in hotel lobby.  \
Agent explores behind front desk and enters hotel manager's office, where SCP-826 sits on shelf beside hotel ledgers.  \
Agent removes DVD from SCP-826 and exits through office door into research room.  \

**Addendum:** Examination of DVD copy revealed no major plot deviations, most likely due to the fact Agent did not interact with any of the characters.  Experiment demonstrates that SCP-826 can work on DVDs as well as books.

**Subject:** Agent ██████
**Book:** //A Brief History of Time//
**Equipment** [[DATA EXPUNGED]]
**Results:** All contact with Agent ██████ was lost after entering the room. Facility evacuated after heightened levels of exotic radiation detected in facility. Multiple casualties from assorted varieties of exotic radiation poisoning among evacuees. Experiment terminated via activation of Protocol ██-██████. All personnel involved in approval of experiment reprimanded. Further experimentation involving texts of a "cosmic" scale prohibited until further notice.
