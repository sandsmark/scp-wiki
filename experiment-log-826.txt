**Head Researcher:** Dr. ██████ 

**Subject:** Agent ██████
**Book:** __Little House on the Prairie__
**Equipment:** One (1) GPS locator, one (1) two-way radio, one (1) canteen filled with water, one (1) watch, one (1) 9mm semi-automatic with extra cartridges. 
**Results:** After Agent ██████ entered the room containing SCP-826 and shut the door, GPS locator and radio held by research team stationed outside the door in a room adjoining the containment chamber malfunctioned, cutting off communication to Agent ██████.  After a period of 5 minutes, Agent ██████ emerged from the door unharmed.  Agent ██████ was dropped in the middle of a prairie with a "green smudge" off to the west (presumably the Verdigris River of the book).  Agent walked towards the river for what he estimated to be an hour, before being approached by one of the main characters of the book returning from a hunting trip and invited to join him for dinner.  Agent accompanied character back to his home, a log cabin in the prairie where he met the rest of the character's family and discovered SCP-826 sitting on the mantlepiece.  When Agent pointed out SCP-826 to the other characters, they claimed SCP was not there before, but did not appear concerned about its presence.  Agent then ate dinner with the family, and afterwards asked if he could take the SCP-contained book with him.  The characters allowed him to take the book, but displayed concern about Agent traveling on the prairie at night.  Agent proceeded to remove the book from SCP-826, and exit through the cabin door into the research team's room.  Display time on watch is consistent with Agent ██████'s report that he had spent several hours in the setting.

**Addendum:** Examination of the SCP contained copy of the book reveals an additional paragraph in the book's mid-section describing Agent ██████'s visit, in language consistent with Laura Ingalls Wilder's style.  No mention is made, however, of SCP-826; Agent is simply described as having dinner and leaving.  This textual deviation appears to be unique to this copy, as other copies do not appear to contain this passage.  Book is now designated Document 826-1.  Researchers are recommended to file copies of documents used with Dr. █████████ under Document 826-(number)

**Subject:** Agent █████████
**Movie:**  //The Shining// (DVD)
**Equipment:** One (1) GPS locator, one (1) two-way radio, one (1) canteen filled with water, one (1) watch, one (1) 9mm semi-automatic with extra cartridges, one (1) video camera attached to Agent's hat
**Results:** After Agent █████████ entered SCP-containing room, GPS and radio proceeded to malfunction as in previous experiment.  After roughly 30 seconds, Agent █████████ exited the room, and gave video camera to research team.  Tape was playable and contained the following footage.

>  Agent █████████ enters into a hotel room from what appeared to be a closet and, after exploring the room and confirming she could not exit through the closet, leaves the room.  Agent continues down hallway and eventually arrives in hotel lobby.  Agent explores behind front desk and enters hotel manager's office, where SCP-826 sits on shelf beside hotel ledgers.  Agent removes DVD from SCP-826 and exits through office door into research room.

**Addendum:** Examination of DVD copy revealed no major plot deviations, most likely due to the fact Agent did not interact with any of the characters.  Experiment demonstrates that SCP-826 can work on DVDs as well as books.

**Subject:** Agent █████████
**Book:** __The Mammoth Book of Comic Fantasy__, a collection of short stories
**Equipment:** One (1) canteen filled with water, one (1) watch, one (1) 9mm semi-automatic with extra cartridges, one (1) video camera attached to Agent's headset //(note: use of GPS locator and two-way radio discontinued, due to their uselessness in previous tests)//
**Results:** Agent █████████ returned after seven minutes, having experienced and recorded just over nine hours. Examination of the recorded footage reveals that the Agent experienced a portion of the short story "The Eye of Tandyla," and was forced to defend himself from temple guards, killing two. This caused the alarm to be raised, and though Agent █████████ was able to retrieve the book from a temple library and escape, the protagonists were apparently caught and executed. The altered copy of the book now reflects this change, although the cause of the alarm is not mentioned, with other stories remaining unaltered. It should also be noted that the book now contains seven fewer pages than a standard, unaltered copy.

Dr. ██████ requests that further experiments be performed with books of short stories, to determine whether the entire book will be experienced, or just a single story, if the book is not recovered from SCP-826 before the story's end.

------
**Head Researcher:** Dr. Edison

**Subject:** Agent █████████
**Book:** "The Sword That Shoots Laser Beams When You Swing It", a 3-page short story written by Dr. Edison. The story consists of a poetic description of a sword that shoots laser beams when swung. The story states it stands on a pedestal as thousands of years pass uneventfully.
**Equipment:** One (1) canteen filled with water, one (1) watch, one (1) video camera attached to Agent's headset.
**Results:** Subject is instructed to retrieve the aforementioned sword, test its "magical" properties, and then bring it out. Subject enters door, and returns five minutes later with the original story, and sword.  Testing proved that sword, when swung in an arc greater than 45 degrees, emits a beam of radiation consistent with the output of a CO2 laser.  Sword has since been assigned to Dr. Edison for furthers study to determine energy source, laser medium, and optical resonators.

Video logs show that the sword in question matched textual descriptions (including the ability to shoot "Laser Beams"), and that Agent █████████ did indeed bring the sword with him. The story itself remains unchanged, except for a paragraph about a man matching Agent █████████'s description stealing the sword and taking it to "Parts Unknown". Sword has been dubbed SCP-826-1.

**Addendum:** Scientific testing has proven inconclusive. Molecular analysis shows that SCP-826-1 has a molecular structure consistent with laser printer paper (the medium original story was printed on), yet behaves like high-grade steel in all other respects. The "Laser Beam", on the other hand, acts like a CO2 laser in all respects but speed, which is clocked at a mere 60 km/h, far slower than conventional lasers. Attempts to collect this energy has proven futile, as energy dissipates within █.██ seconds regardless of hitting a target. 

Of further note, Agent █████████ has come under the delusion that he is a man named "Galthor" from the kingdom of "Zolgorn". Agent █████████ has insisted on the return of SCP-826-1 to his homeland, and to be released from whatever "foul sorcery" he has been placed under. All attempts at treatment have proven futile. Dr. Edison requests that all further testing with SCP-826 is to be done by D-Class subjects.

**Addendum 2:** At precisely ██:██:██ on ██/██/██ (exactly 72 hours from Agent █████████'s last trip into SCP-826), Agent █████████ and SCP-826-1 simultaneously disappeared. No trace has been found of the two, and Agent █████████'s existence has been stripped from all Foundation records, including backup copies. The story used in the test in all aspects identical, barring a mention that the man's name was "Galthor". Once again, Dr. Edison suggests that further testing of SCP-826 is to be done by D-Class subjects.

**Subject:** D-826-01
**Book:** "The Sword That Shoots Laser Beams When You Swing It", a 3-page short story written by Dr. Edison. Same copy that resulted from previous test, alterations and all.
**Equipment:** One (1) canteen filled with water, one (1) watch, one (1) video camera attached to Subject's headset, one (1) Police issue X26 Taser (loaded).
**Results:** Subject is asked to retrieve Agent █████████. Subject does not return after five minutes.  Agent C██████  enters SCP-826 and retrieves the story without incident. Story now has additional details on a "man in strange garb" trying to stop Agent █████████ with a "magic weapon hereby unknown to man", which matches a description of X26 Police Tazer. Story then describes Agent █████████ injuring D-826-01 with SCP-826-01 before "locking him in the foulest of dungeons in Castle Hyleth". Recovered footage confirms incident.

**Subject:** D-826-02, D-826-03, D-826-04, D-826-05, D-826-06, and D-826-07, all of whom have military training.
**Book:** "The Sword That Shoots Laser Beams When You Swing It", a 3-page short story written by Dr. Edison. Same copy that resulted from previous test.
**Equipment:** Six (6) canteens filled with water, six (6) watches, six (6) video cameras attached to Subjects' headsets, six (6) Police issue X26 Tasers (loaded).
**Results:**  Subjects given successfully apprehend Agent █████████ and D-826-01, leaving SCP-826-01 behind. Story acknowledges all changes, describing "six rogues" who "clamored to avenge the blood of their fallen brother" capturing Agent █████████.
**Addendum:** Agent  █████████ still experiencing pathological delusions, and remains convinced that he is a Knight named "Galthor". Likewise, D-826-01 claims to be a "Blood Wizard" named "Rohthmorn", seeking to claim SCP-826-01 to himself. D-826-01's X26 taser has turned into a "Magic Staff" capable of shooting "Lightning", and is hypothesized to have physical properties similar to SCP-826-01. Item has been labeled SCP-826-02, and has been sent to Site ██ for further testing. Also, Subjects D-826-02, D-826-03, D-826-04, D-826-05, D-826-06, and D-826-07 are now claiming to be "Knights of the Throne" sent to aid "Galthor".


**Addendum 2:** As in the previous experiment, Agent █████████, Subjects D-826-02, D-826-03, D-826-04, D-826-05, D-826-06, and D-826-07, and SCP-826-02 disappeared at ██:██:██ on ██/██/██ (again, exactly 72 hours from exiting SCP-826). Story now says that "Galthor" was indeed accompanied by 6 "Knights of the Throne", who were armed with "Arcane Weapons" given to them by the good wizard "Edisongrad". All researchers that had been handling SCP-826-02 or SCP-826 are accounted for.  Further monitoring of researchers handling objects from SCP-826 is recommended.


//Okay, seriously: How did that thing know my name? I'm sure I didn't tell it to either of the agents, and I'm damn sure that I didn't tell any of the subjects. I know this turns up so much in our line of work that it's kind of cliché, but I think the thing might just be sentient...// -Dr. Edison


**Head Researcher:** Dr. Luis Padrona Escopa

**Subject:** D-826-08
**Material:** The security log of a [preventable] Keter-class containment breach at Site-█, dated 1981
**Equipment:** One (1) video recorder, Two (2) bottles of infection sterilization medicine, a detailed 7 page manual on how to prevent the breach, requiring SCP-005, clothing matching that of an appropriate SCP Agent, and Level 4 fingerprints (outdated)
**Results:** The test was performed 5 times, with only one placing D-826-08 in the correct time. D-826-08 successfully stopped the breach, and was awarded a Foundation star. SCP-826-1 successfully removed. No difference to current timeline was made.




**Head Researcher:** Dr. Praetorious
**Subject:** D-21094
**Material:** Death by the Book, by Julianna Deering
**Equipment:** One (1) canteen filled with water, one (1) watch, one (1) video camera attached to Test Subject's headset
**Results:** Upon entering, the test subject returned after 15 minutes. After interviewing the subject and reviewing the footage it was discovered that the beginning of the novel was the first location found by the subject, being the murder scene that is investigated by the main characters and sets the stage for the remainder of the book. The characters, being from a 1930’s period piece, reacted inquisitively to the D-class’ alien clothing and behavior, but did not impede the subject’s examination of the surroundings. In fact at one point the investigator, Chief Inspector Birdsong, interpreted the orange jumpsuit worn by the subject as meaning they were from the coroner’s office, and encouraged them to wait nearby until he was finished examining the crime scene.

It was at this time that video showed the murder weapon used in the crime and sitting next to the body, originally written as a marble bookend shaped like a bust of William Shakespeare, was in fact one half of SCP-826. The novel that had been entered was lying on the floor, roughly half-way between the “murder weapon” and the other half of SCP-826. The test subject immediately retrieved the novel, despite the protests of the characters, and exited the novel before they could react.

Upon examination, the novel now contained an additional character to the first chapter described as an “opportunistic thief” who took advantage of the crime to “pilfer the belongs of the deceased”. Of special note is that the murder weapon was now a “handsome bookend of particular high quality”.

This is the first reported incident of SCP-826 integrating itself into the plot of a novel. It might be an indicator of sentience or merely the narrative taking advantage of the fact that the SCP is identical to an item already in the novel. More testing is suggested.



**Head Researcher:** Dr. Aaron Torres

**Subject:** D-87631
**Material:** A copy of "A Game of Thrones" by George R.R Martin.
**Equipment:** One (1) Military-grade sabre
**Results:** Upon entering, the test subject found itself in a circular room, with a table in it. At the table were the members of the "Small Council" as described in the original work. Test subject was instructed to disembowel the first human it sees in the work; this human happened to be "Lord Eddard Stark," the protagonist of the book. Upon examination after D-87631 exited the room, the book contained several new paragraphs on an attempt by a "very unintelligent assassin" on Eddard Stark's life. According to the text, Eddard recovered quickly, despite D-87631 reassuring Dr. Torres that "I stabbed him until he was definitely not going to live." The description of the attack supports this; it is theorized that SCP-826 takes measures to preserve the core narrative of the story.

//The purpose of this test was to see what would happen if we did something that would effect the main plot of a complex story; such as A Song of Ice and Fire. Also, I love that book.// -Dr. Torres


 **Head Researcher:** Dr.Zocvi

 **Subject:** D-2828
 **Material:** After Man,by Dougal Dixon
**Equipment:** Two (2) canteens filled with water,two (2) bags of trail mix,one (1) jacket,one (1) sleeping bag one (1) head mounted camera
 **Results:**  Upon entering,the test subject found that he was in temperate forest. D-2828 walked for about 30 minutes before he found a small clearing in the trees where he set-up camp and read his mangas he had hidden until sunset. Upon waking up, the subject packed up and ate and drank his remaining trail mix and water. D-2828 walked back into the forest,where after 28 minutes,came across a small group of Rabbucks grazing. The test subject was watching them,when he realised the Rabbucks were getting anxious. Subject then turned around and saw a group of five Falanx closing in on them. After the test subject turned around,the Rabbucks fled at full speed. Scared, subject ran at full speed and followed them. Subject got about 54 metres away before one of the Falanx tackled and bit him on the leg. At that point the test subject grabbed a sharp stick and stabbed at the Falanx's eye causing it to run away. D-2828 ran for 6 minutes until he reached a stream, in which SCP-826 was sitting on a boulder. The test subject walked towards it and grabbed it. D-2828 saw a cave and walked through it, returning back the testing chamber. One of The book's pictures now show D-2828 fighting off the Falanx and claiming him "The last human to ever live.". 
"The reason for us testing is to see the effects on a book with illustrations."- Dr.Zocvi
