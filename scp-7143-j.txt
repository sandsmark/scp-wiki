**Item #:** SCP-7143-J

**Object Class:** --Safe-- Sensual

**Special Containment Procedures:** Site-19 staff are reminded that attempts to seduce, coerce, or otherwise solicit SCP-7143-J in any way will result in disciplinary measures. SCP-7143-J is not to be bought dinner, or tickets to a movie, or offered rides home in the rain.

**Description:** SCP-7143-J is a remarkably good-looking metal doorknob affixed to a door in the third floor of the staff dormitory. Currently it is unknown if SCP-7143-J exhibits any anomalous properties, though it has been determined that SCP-7143-J is a stone cold fox. SCP-7143-J has also been described as being a "hot momma", "hunka-hunka burnin' love", a "fine piece of ass", and "easy on the eyes". 

It is unconfirmed as to whether SCP-7143-J is single or not, but SCP-7143-J has been confirmed for being a total flirt, and if they've got a ring they're definitely not wearing it. It is rumored that Dr. Torvald and SCP-7143-J had a thing going on in the summer of 2011, but have since split up, citing "irreconcilable differences".

SCP-7143-J is notoriously scandalous, and has been the cause of no fewer than 73 recorded instances of breakups between members of Foundation staff thus far. The number of personnel cited for inappropriate contact with SCP-7143-J is 34 as of May 2015, and the number of personnel cited for indecent communication with SCP-7143-J, even in passing, is well over 300.

//**Note:** The following testimony was gathered during an anonymous survey to ascertain the overall staff opinion of SCP-7143-J. Certain portions have been expunged for the sake of decency.
