**Item #:** SCP-7143-J

**Object Class:** N/A[[footnote]]Currently the Foundation has no protocols by which to contain a doorknob.[[/footnote]]

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to SCP-7143-J being a doorknob, no containment procedures are necessary.

**Description:** SCP-7143-J is a doorknob on the door to the third floor staff dormitory at Site-19. It is made of metal. Turning it to the right or left opens the door to which it is affixed. It has a lock, which is used to impede the intended action of turning the doorknob so as to not allow individuals to access the rooms beyond.
