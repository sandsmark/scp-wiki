**Item #:** SCP-707

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-707 is kept disassembled in a double-locked secure locker at Site ██. Experimentation may only be performed with prior, written permission from at least two (2) Level 3 personnel. Once assembled, SCP-707 may only be handled by Class-D personnel.

**Description:** SCP-707 is a matryoshka doll, or Russian nesting doll, consisting of one (1) center doll and four (4) separating outer layers. The doll is painted in a primarily blue color palette, and dating of the materials, while inconclusive, show that it is approximately ██ years old.

When a living human subject opens SCP-707 from a fully assembled state, its anomalous effect will occur within approximately ten (10) minutes later. The severity of this effect is dependent on how many layers are opened, and are as follows:

* 1 layer - Subject's hair and nails will painlessly and completely fall out. This includes internal hair and cilia, such as that within the nose and ears.
* 2 layers - Subject's skin will split, separate, and fall off within seconds. The loss of skin is painless, but exposed internal tissue has been described as being very sensitive, and even a light touch can cause bleeding.
* 3 layers - Subject's muscles will detach from connective tissue, including the diaphragm and heart.
* 4 layers - Subject's organs separate and detach.

No subject to date has survived the separation of more than 1 layer of SCP-707. However, despite the incredible trauma inflicted by the separation of 2 or more layers, brain activity monitors have determined that subjects are fully conscious and aware of their condition for up to several minutes after the separation event, until the subject expires (typically through blood loss or asphyxiation).

**Experiment Log 707-1:** Notable experiment results.

**Date:** █/█/██
**Subject:** D-10872, male Caucasian, 33 years old
**Procedure:** Subject instructed to separate 1 layer from, then quickly reassemble SCP-707.
**Details:** Ten (10) minutes after initial separation, Subject lost all body hair and nails. Subject became agitated, and was shot after attempting to attack a security officer.

**Note:** //Following the experiment, Assistant Researcher █████ quickly disassembled SCP-707 so that it could be returned to storage. The security footage from Euclid Item Storage B of the resulting incident is available as a reminder to all personnel of the possible consequences of not strictly following anomalous object handling procedures.//

**Date:** █/██/██
**Subject:** D-10935, male African-American, 29 years old
**Procedure:** Subject instructed to separate all layers of SCP-707.
**Details:** Ten (10) minutes after initial separation, Subject lost all hair, skin, muscles, and organs in rapid succession. Medical staff quickly attached sensors to the brain of Subject and were able to record readings consistent with conscious activity for approximately three (3) minutes before Subject expired.

**Date:** █/██/██
**Subject:** D-10947, female Caucasian, 28 years old (Subject A), D-10949, male Caucasian, 32 years old (Subject B)
**Procedure:** Subject A instructed to separate one layer from SCP-707, then Subject B instructed to separate another layer from SCP-707 immediately afterward.
**Details:** Ten (10) minutes after initial separation, both Subjects rapidly lost all hair, nails, and skin. Although immediately sedated and placed on life support, both Subjects expired within a short period of time due to system shock.

**Date:** █/██/██
**Subject:** D-11089, male Caucasian, 36 years old
**Procedure:** Subject instructed in the use of a remotely operated robotic manipulator and instructed to separate 1 layer of SCP-707.
**Details:** Ten (10) minutes after initial separation, Subject lost all body hair and nails, as in initial experiment. Subject excused from mandatory monthly termination for a period of six (6) months for observation, during which no hair or nails grew back.

**Date:** ██/█/██
**Subject:** D-13123, female Asian, 31 years old
**Procedure:** Subject instructed to remove the second layer of SCP-707, which had been left untouched since the previous experiment with D-11089.
**Details:** D-11089 immediately lost all skin while under observation at Site █, ███ km away. Ten (10) minutes after initial separation, Subject lost all hair, nails, and skin. Both test subjects terminated normally.

**Date:** ██/█/██
**Subject:** Automated robotic manipulator unit E108
**Procedure:** Subject programmed to independently separate all layers from SCP-707.
**Details:** Ten minutes after the initial separation, all personnel involved in the programming and maintenance of Subject E108 violently [DATA EXPUNGED]. Further experimentation with robotic or remote operation has been canceled.

**Addendum 707-1:** The use of SCP-707 as an efficient method of procuring viable transplant organs for Foundation uses is under review.
