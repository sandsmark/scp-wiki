title:Scp 5555
**Recovered from the personal log of Dr L██████:**

██/██/████:
At last, my genius has been recognized! I have been contacted by the Overseers^^1^^ to begin work on an SCP of extreme importance. Everything is hush hush, top secret, so I'll be keeping my notes secure here. I'm not even sure which Overseer has assigned me the project, it's that secret. I'll be at Site 421^^2^^for the duration, and I have been assured SCP-260 has been handled. I'll write more when I get the time!

██/██/████:
Amazing! I have been promoted to Level 4^^3^^, and put in control of everyone at the Site! I have an enormous crew of D-Class to work with, and, even better, my own SCP. This thing is amazing. You simply [Illegible]^^4^^ and then presto! You have a midget version of the target.  Or is it dwarf? Whichever one has the big head. And, despite being a pretty good copy of the original, there are differences. The dwarfs(midgets?) are more, well, refined versions of the original. Whatever aspects make a person become even more prevelant, almost to the point of caricature. Copies are rather high strung, doing everything to the utmost they can, with great enthusiasm. 
All this has already been proven and dealt with. What I am here for is to test the device on intelligent SCPs and Researchers. Apparently there are some of them they wouldn't mind replacing.^^5^^

██/██/████:
**Testing Log 1** 
Subject- [[[SCP-953]]]
Result- A tiny fox lady, near to bouncing off the walls with energy. Upon initial creation, she jumped on a D-Class, kissed him on the lips, shoved her claws through his nostrils, fondled his crotch, and then bit his throat out. She preceded to massacre  the other three D's in the testing room, before gas was applied. The remains were incinerated.  Something more stable for the next one.

**Testing Log 7**
Subject: [[[SCP-076]]]
Result:After the previous successes we decided to try a hard one. Mini-076 was an unmitigated disaster. He was created much closer to the original, entering a killing rage upon creation. The decrease in size resulted in an increase in speed, leaving us with something much like a cross between a bouncy ball and a Cuisinart. Mini-076 came close to breaking containment, however at the last moment the real 076 showed up, and took care of it. He rather forcefully made the point that such liberties would not be allowed to happen again. Luckily, my assistant Ryan took responsibility. I'll miss Ryan. Gonna call a halt to it for the day.

██/██/████:
**Testing Log 8**
Subject: Dr. Rights
Result: Having failed rather horribly with the SCPs, I have decided to move on to my fellow researchers. Due in part to a crush I have upon said researcher, Rights was a perfect fit. And I have to say, even at a third the size, she is striking. Mini-Rights expressed interest in SCP-5555, and then preceded to remove her clothes and seduce me, which I willingly allowed.

**Note:**And then she hit me in the head with a lamp while I attempted to enjoy the afterglow.

**Note:** MiniRights has breeched containment. Security says they'll bring her back quickly.

**Testing Log 9**
Subject: Dr. Gears
Result: Mini-Gears is little more then a robot. He reacts to outside stimulus, responding to questions, but seems to show no curiosity, or outward will. A rather large wind up key in his back has no actual use. Mini-gears has been regulated to the incinerator.

**Note:** Somewhere between the testing lab and the incinerator, Mini-Gears vanished. One of our transports is also missing. Damn it!

**Testing Log 10**
Subject: Dr. Clef
Result: I told them no, I told them this one we should just leave, but nooo, I gotta try all the important researchers.
Where the FUCK did he get that shotgun from? I'm gonna go see Mini-590 about my legs, and hope Security can take the gun away.

**Note:**Need new security. Half of them dead or wounded, Mini-Clef nowhere to be found.

[More stuff in here]

**Notations**
1: There is no record of any Overseer contacting Dr. L██████.
2: Site 421 does not now, and never has existed.
3: No such promotion has been  found anywhere in the Foundations records.
4: This section appears to have been altered to illegibility on purpose.
5: While true, no reliable methods have been proposed.
