**Special Containment Procedures:** All newly discovered instances of SCP-5000 are to be kept in a standard storage locker in the restricted containment section of Site-11's archaeological ward.
Â 
**Description:** SCP-5000 is a small object, constructed from petrified clay, which resembles a simple compass rose. Several thaumaturgic markings, appearing to be of ancient Greek origin, are carved into SCP-5000. The meanings of these markings are unknown. SCP-5000 is believed to be a device designed for navigation towards SCP-5000-A, an extradimensional space believed to be the inspiration for myths regarding Daedalus's Labyrinth.

SCP-5000 is comprised of five pieces, designated SCP-5000-1 through -5, with SCP-5000-1 through -4 being the four "pointers" of the compass rose and SCP-5000-5 being the central piece. The five pieces can function separately or together. When separate, the tips of each of the corner pieces and the middle of the central piece will, through unknown means, glow a faint cyan. However, when together, the glow of each component will be distinct and will indicate the direction in which the user should continue to find the nearest entrance to SCP-5000-A.

**Exploration:** Mobile Task Force Zeta-9 was sent into SCP-5000-A via an entrance which Foundation thaumatologist Doctor Sphere found in the ruins outside of Luxor, Egypt.

On 14 December 2019, a representative from the Global Occult Coalition's PHYSICS Division contacted the SCP Foundation and proposed a joint expedition into SCP-5000-A, performed by members from a Foundation Mobile Task Force and a Coalition Assessment Team. Following a vote by the O5 Council, the expedition was approved 7 to 2 with 1 abstaining.

On 21 December 2019, Expedition Team 5000-Alpha (consisting of four members of MTF Zeta-9 "Mole Rats", four members of GOC Assessment Team 3627 "Minotaur", and one field researcher from each organization) entered SCP-5000-A. Due to difficulties in recording and transmission of video logs, Major Una was advised to keep an audio journal accounting recent events experienced within SCP-5000-A. The following is a compilation of all notable entries.

> -----
> Hey, Una here. Still got a few hours 'till we enter the maze, we're being airlifted out there now.
> 
> Obviously we Mole Rats knew each other beforehand, but we've had about a day to get to know the GOC team. For some reason, they're under orders not to give us their real names, but we've got some callsigns we can refer to them by.
> 
> Midas is their CO, but he's a captain so at least I've got authority over him. Apparently the reason he's called Midas is that when he was headed off to boot camp he brought a gold locket with a picture of his boyfriend at the time - his training group saw it was made of gold and the callsign was a given at that point.
> 
> They call the next guy Mars. I guess he was an astronaut candidate at some point, but once he failed one of the exams they flunked him out. He still had a military background, though, so he decided to join back up since he was still young enough and was eventually brought in by the GOC.
> 
> Tweedledee and Tweedledum are //apparently// identical twins, but you wouldn't know by looking at them. They joined up together, trained together, and one has never been promoted without the other being promoted as well. But honestly, they couldn't be more dissimilar with regards to their personalities. Tweedledee is quiet and mostly keeps to himself, but Tweedledum never stops talking. And it's not like she's annoying either - just //really// enthusiastic about everything.
> 
> According to the team, Pendulum was never really able to stay on one task for very long, but she could switch from one to another in a heartbeat, meaning she's a great multitasker and is often working through multiple problems at a time. Hopefully, that helps with this mission.
> 
> Alright, I'm being told we've got five minutes until we're at the entrance. Better start getting ready to head out. The next time you hear from me we'll be deep in the maze.

> **Expedition Log 5000-Alpha, Entry 2**
> -----
> Una again. 12 hours since we passed through the entrance. We can't tell the time or how long we've been in here based on any ambient light, there isn't any really - but we've all got watches, of course.
> 
> It was a lot of walking, to be honest. Occasionally we'd stop to rest and eat some rations but mostly just 12 hours of repetitive, boring walking and following the compass. We did come across a few interesting places, though. For about an hour we were walking along this massive bridge across what seemed to be some sort of bottomless pit, but the walls were all lined with books. They were too far away for me to read any of the titles, but every once in a while something would fall - sometimes a book, but sometimes it was too fast to tell. Some things were definitely //not// books though.
> 
> There was also one corridor that had about three different traps within it - too old to activate, or maybe they'd been disarmed, but there wasn't any danger.
> 
> Nijimura is telling me to get some rest. I guess I should take his advice. I'll report back tomorrow, or at least as soon as I can.

> **Expedition Log 5000-Alpha, Entry 3**
> -----
> Someone's definitely been here before us.
> 
> We came across another trap - a dart trap in the wall. The dart had been shot out at a high enough speed to embed itself an inch in the wall, and the blood from whoever it hit was splattered across it too. And it was recently enough that the blood is dried, but it's not a stain, it's still just dried blood. Someone's in here with us.
> 
> Pendulum and Mars wanted to examine the trap mechanisms, so we're taking a rations break. We've been in here for just over 48 hours. Not much that's very interesting, but we've come across a few hallways where it's just locked doors all the way through, even on the ceilings. Hopefully we find something useful soon.

> **Expedition Log 5000-Alpha, Entry 4**
> -----
> Nothing eventful today. Tweedledee and Tweedledum went out to scout, didn't find anything of importance, just more corridors and locked doors.

> **Expedition Log 5000-Alpha, Entry 5**
> -----
> Well, we found who's in here with us. Two teenagers named Lance and Danielle - say they're from the Serpent's Hand. We ran into them a couple of hours ago, one of them was injured. Apparently, he was the one hit by the dart we found earlier. They said another friend of theirs, named Drew, went ahead to scout, but it'd been several hours and he hadn't returned.
> 
> We asked Danielle why they're here, and she said they have another one of the compasses. Apparently, there's some story about some treasure being hidden somewhere within the maze, and the three of them are looking for it.
> 
> This is the first we hear about it - all we're looking for is whatever the compass is leading us to. Maybe if we manage to make it to the center of the maze we might find this treasure, whatever it is.
> 
> The kids are coming along with us, but they're not exactly happy about it. They said something about not wanting to align themselves with "Bookburners and Jailors", whatever that means. Regardless, they're coming along.

> **Expedition Log 5000-Alpha, Entry 6**
> -----
> We found another kid. He's dead. Bullet went clean through his head, right between the eyes. Lance and Danielle don't recognize him, so it's pretty likely he was here on his own. He's got a journal with him. I'll take it with me for analysis once we return home.

> **Expedition Log 5000-Alpha, Entry 7**
> -----
> Well, something interesting, finally. Some sort of big atrium with carvings on the walls. We can't identify what language the markings are in if they even are in any particular language. But there are corridors branching out in every direction, even where they would normally intersect with other corridors. We're gonna sleep here tonight and pick a corridor in the morning.

> **Expedition Log 5000-Alpha, Entry 8**
> -----
> Well, something's different this time. A door's been blown off its hinges, and it leads into another corridor, but this one heads //down//. Up until now, there haven't been any elevation changes in here at all.
> 
> There's also the fact that the door was completely removed. We found remnants of plastic explosives. These feel like Chaos Insurgency tactics, and I'm not sure I really want to cross paths with the Insurgency in here.
> 
> This place is gonna give me a hell of a headache.

> **Expedition Log 5000-Alpha, Entry 9**
> -----
> I've got a hell of a headache. And a couple of minor bullet wounds.
> 
> For one, I was right about the Insurgency's presence here. But they saw us before we saw them and started shooting immediately. Tweedledee and Abdul were hit pretty hard, and we took down one of their operatives, but other than that everyone's fine.
>
> We did notice the Insurgency's got one of the compasses. If we see them again we're going to try and pin them down so we can get some answers.

> **Expedition Log 5000-Alpha, Entry 10**
> -----
> Tweedledee's dead. We did everything we could.
> 
> We found an alcove to lay him to rest in. Tweedledum wanted to do more for him, but we can't afford any of that.

> **Expedition Log 5000-Alpha, Entry 11**
> -----
> Well, we ran into the Insurgency squad again - thanks to a lazy guard, we managed to sneak up on them while they were sleeping. We took their guns and pinned them down.
> 
> The Insurgency is here looking for this supposed treasure, too. How did apparently everyone but us know about this treasure, whatever it is?
>
> We don't know what we're gonna do with them. I guess we'll see.

> **Expedition Log 5000-Alpha, Entry 12**
> -----
> Okay, so apparently a couple of details were left out in our interrogation of the Insurgency operatives. They're the third team to go in, neither of the others came back. I guess I can't blame the Insurgency for sending more than one team in, the Foundation does the same sometimes, regardless of how obviously fucking stupid it might be.
> 
> They also confirmed they killed both Drew and the random kid we found a few days ago - We haven't told Danielle or Lance, but I'm pretty sure they have their suspicions.

> **Expedition Log 5000-Alpha, Entry 13**
> -----
> The kids are gone, and so is the Insurgency team's compass. I guess they ran off while we were sleeping.
> 
> One of the nearby doors is open and it leads down again. Considering the circumstances, they probably followed where the compass led them. We're gonna try to follow them.

**Entries 14 through 21 were corrupted and could not be recovered.**

> **Expedition Log 5000-Alpha, Entry 22**
> -----
> Midas, Mars, and Pendulum just left, and they took the Insurgency prisoners with them. They were under orders to evacuate as soon as two of their operatives died, so when Tweedledum expired, the remaining three of them took one of the compasses and left. I guess they took the Insurgents with them for further interrogation once they're out of this hell.
> 
> Now it's just Nijimura, Pendleton, and me. Drew, Danielle, and Lance are still missing.

> **Expedition Log 5000-Alpha, Entry 23**
> -----
> We're seeing more vents and pipes along the walls. We might be getting closer to something, because I'm starting to hear some sort of humming. It's far away, and I can only hear it just barely through the metal pipes, but it's definitely there.
> 
> We've still got plenty of food and water - they gave us about a few months' worth for ten people since we didn't know how long we were gonna be in here, and now that there's only three of us, we've got more than enough for however long this takes us.

> **Expedition Log 5000-Alpha, Entry 24**
> -----
> We're getting closer to something. There are more and more pipes, almost as if they're converging toward something. The compass seems to be leading us in the same direction as them, too.
> 
> We rarely get more than 4 to 6 hours of sleep. There's something about this place that doesn't let you rest. Nijimura is offering to scout ahead so Pendleton and I can try and get some real rest, but I can't let him do that. We need to stick together, no matter how tired we are.

> **Expedition Log 5000-Alpha, Entry 25**
> -----
> Okay, something's changed - it's all pipes now. The walls, the ceiling, the floor, all pipes. We're getting close to something. Not sure what, but it's gotta be important.

> **Expedition Log 5000-Alpha, Entry 26**
> -----
> Fuck. I should have seen this coming.
> 
> Nijimura's gone. He left with one of the compasses while Pendleton and I were sleeping. I don't know whether he headed forward or back. Wherever he went, we can't stop now.
> 
> The humming is getting louder. It's getting hotter too.

> **Expedition Log 5000-Alpha, Entry 27**
> -----
> We're almost... somewhere. I can feel it.

> **Expedition Log 5000-Alpha, Entry 28**
> -----
> I'm alone. The others are both dead.
> 
> Pendleton and I found Nijimura, but something had changed. He started ranting about the maze punishing the unworthy and the core being the answer. Pendleton tried to approach him, but he just shot her. He tried to take aim at me too, but I pulled the trigger first.
> 
> He died instantly. Pendleton didn't. I didn't have any first aid left - we used it all on the others, who all died anyway. She bled out in my arms.
> 
> So now it's just me.

> **Expedition Log 5000-Alpha, Entry 29**
> -----
> I found it.
> 
> Apparently Nijimura wasn't spouting complete nonsense - there is a core. And it's right in front of me.
> 
> It's fucking massive. A giant fucking crystal, embedded in the floor and ceiling. It's glowing the same shade of blue as the compass. The pipes are coming out of the ceiling too, but they're not connected to the core.
> 
> Why does this place even need a core? Nijimura said "the core is the answer" before he died - is it some kind of power source?

> **Expedition Log 5000-Alpha, Entry 30**
> -----
> I just noticed there's a door on the core. None of the doors have been quite the same, but this one is really different. Not even just in appearance, but I can feel something about this one.
> 
> ...what the hell?
> 
> Okay, there's some sort of crossroads inside the core. There's a bridge that goes from this door to an intersection of hundreds - no, //thousands// of other doors. They're all completely different too. One's some sort of staff door, one's a cave opening, and there's even just a mirror.
> 
> What the hell is this place?

> **Expedition Log 5000-Alpha, Entry 31**
> -----
> I think I figured it out. The core isn't the crossroads, the whole labyrinth is. The core's just powering it all.
>
> I'm pretty sure the labyrinth creates some sort of pocket reality that only exists from the inside. The doors within the core lead to other labyrinths within other realities, and each of them has its own core powering it.
> 
> There's no way I can get out of here on my own. But I have another idea.
> 
> Imagine this: this labyrinth is like a website. Being inside is like being logged in, but in this case, there's no option to log out. You can only log out if you're forced out. So what if I force myself out? What if I shut down the maze?
> 
> If I figure out how to shut down the core, the maze will lose power. And if it loses power, it might force me out. I and everything else in this branch of the maze will be ejected to its home reality, and after a while, the maze might come back online, or it might not.
> 
> Or I could just get stuck. Or just be deleted from all existences entirely.
> 
> I can't make this decision too quickly. If I shut down the core and successfully get ejected to baseline reality, the next time you hear from me will be when I'm back home.

On 9 January 2020, numerous anomalous natural disasters took place simultaneously at locations known to also possess an entrance into SCP-5000-A. Major Una of MTF Zeta-9 was found unconscious outside of the entrance located near Havana, Cuba. No other members of the expedition team were with her.

**Item of Interest #1:** A journal was discovered during Zeta-9âs exploration into SCP-5000-A.Â Â A digital transcription of its contents has been posted for convenience. The journal is being kept in the written archive of Site-11 and is scheduled for thaumaturgic testing within the next month.

> **Entry #1**
> Alright so this is going to be one crazy journal. My heart is racing with excitement. Iâm still packing my bags, but I wanted to remember this for a lifetime and record everything before I forgot. So yesterday, I was at Stackers, complaining about the lack of excitement. So, Lillian, who is the bartender, suggested I go seek out Olâ Wind Charm.
>Â Â Â 
> I had been to Stackerâs a few times before, so to learn that Olâ Wind Charm was the ghost of a dead pirate wasnât the most shocking thing. Lillian herself seemed to be a ghost at times. Regardless, I sought out Olâ Wind Charm at the other end of the bar, she was rather pleasant to talk to. I sat down with the dead pirate for a bit and listened to her tale.
>Â Â Â 
> I must have sat with Olâ Wind Charm for several hours, but I easily lost track of time while in Stackerâs. Olâ Wind Charm told me about how she and crew ventured the seas with a magic compass, with rumored to point in the direction of a treasure so grand and rich, that the gods themselves hid the riches so no mortal lay their eyes on it. She even gave me a piece of the compass. It looked like an old worn rock. I was told it used to be bigger, but she was only able to grab one piece of the compass when her ship came under fire by the British Royal Navy at the time.
>Â Â Â 
> Olâ Wind Charm encouraged me to follow her late quest, to find the divine treasure, to do what she and crew couldnât. I gave her my thanks as I took her floating glowy rock she called a compass and left Stackerâs

> **Entry #2**
> I took Olâ Wind Charmâs advice and got an economy class ticket down to Cuba. Thatâs where Olâ Wind Charm and her crew were heading before their demise. I was looking forward to exploring Cuba. It was a hiking destination my father and I had set our eyes on for years, but it was the nice Caribbean beaches that we wanted to explore compared to the mountain range. Iâll have to tell my father how it was when I go visit him later, I didnât think he would be too enthusiastic that I was going down to Cuba because a dead pirate told me too.
>Â Â Â 
> My plane just landed. Itâs taking a while to get off. Weâve been stuck on the runway waiting for other planes to move. The place seems busy, a bunch of military vehicles are here too. I never knew military planes could land at a public airport, the more you know.
>Â Â Â 
> Finally got off the plane and got a decent hotel room. I plan on staying here for at least a week. I figured Iâd hit up the bar and beach before following Olâ Wind Charm's treasure hunt. At least if the old ghost was lying to me, I got one hell of a vacation out of it. Thatâs a win in my book.

> **Entry #3**
> I woke up early this morning to the sounds of helicopters flying close by. I ran to the balcony of my room, they were heading inland from the ocean. I always loved watching helicopters. Some of my fondest memories were playing with the little R/C copters my uncle gave me as a kid.
>Â Â Â 
> After I got around for the day and had breakfast, I began to set out on my adventure for real. I took out the piece of the compass Olâ Wind Charm gave me, hoping it would give me some clues. The floaty rock was glowing a bit more than when I was at Stackerâs so hopefully that meant I was on the right track.
>Â Â Â 
> I started to walk down the beach. Iâm thankful the helicopters woke me so early. The white sandy beach was void of people, it was so calm and relaxing.
>Â Â Â Â 
> I spotted more helicopters. I saw one with a strange symbol on the side. A circle with a red dot in the middle. Perhaps it Japanese helicopters? I got no clue what they would be doing in Cuba. I suppose it doesnât matter. I got a treasure hunt to follow!
>Â Â Â Â 
> Iâve been wandering the beach for some time now. It has started to become populated with tourists and locals. I stopped to watch some fishing boats go out and in. This old man came to shore with a huge tuna in a tiny canoe, it was amazing watching the old man display his mastered skill.
>Â Â Â Â 
> The kind old man saw me staring and invited me over. We chatted for a bit and I explained I was looking into the stories of pirates that would come to port here a lifetime ago. I could see his eyes light up as I explained my ânormalâ story. Of course, I left out the part about Stackerâs. I canât have everyone thinking Iâm bat shit insane.
>Â Â Â Â 
> The kind old man invited me to his small cottage. I learned his name was Santiago. We shared a drink after I helped him butcher up the tuna to sell later tomorrow. We exchanged our stories. Although, Santiago had much more to share than I did. After another round of drinks, and more stories. Santiago suggested I head further north to where an old port to use lay, which has since been turned to beaches by the passage of time. He thought it might be a good idea to kick start my pirate hunt.

> **Entry #4**
> New morning. New objective. Thanks to Santiago, I had a proper goal for the day besides endlessly roaming the beaches.
>Â Â Â Â 
> I took a taxi up to the beach Santiago suggested and starting my search. The rock Olâ Wind Charm gave me was as useless as ever. It still glowed though, so hopefully, that means Iâm doing good. I swear if that old ghost sent me on a wild goose chase, Iâll probably thank them. This has been fun so far. I at least have gotten the excitement I was looking for. Lillian would say something poetic about how thatâs the treasure at the end of this hunt, was the fun of the hunt itself. Who knows. Maybe real treasure awaits.
>Â Â Â 
> There doesnât seem to be many people at this beach. I guess itâs not as well known. It wasnât in a tourist location so I guess that makes sense. I hope it wonât be too hard to get back to my hotel room.
>Â Â Â Â 
> Okay, so this is insane! I was walking down the beach and up the side towards the cliff face and I stumbled across a small cave. But from the looks of it, it goes on deep! Iâm so happy to have taken my packed bag. Iâm all set for exploration.
>Â Â Â Â 
> It has been roughly 30 minutes. This cave is long and cramped. Hardly enough space between my shoulders as I walk. Dad would have loved to explore something like this with me. Heâll be thrilled when I come back with stories of this adventure!
>Â Â Â 
> It has been another 45 minutes. I think I have finally come to the end of this cave tunnel. There is this flat brownstone in my way. Itâs entirely smooth too, not like the jagged cave walls. I guess Iâm gonna head back.
>Â Â Â 
> I decided to check the rock Olâ Wind Charm gave me, and let me tell you how grateful I am that I did! Not only was it glowing brighter it seemed to float towards the smooth wall. I tapped the compass to the smooth stone wall and a glowing blue symbol appeared, as the stone wall started to move. Now instead of the jagged rocky tunnel, the flat smooth stone gave way to a brick corridor. Iâm going to head back to my hotel room and cancel my reservation, as well as grab some camping supplies and food. I got no clue how long Iâll be in this tunnel.

> **Entry #5**
> Alright, itâs the next day. Iâm back with more supplies and about to head into the tunnel. I had to tap the floating glowy rock on the smooth surface again as it had closed itself somehow. Probably magic. Maybe my friends in Germany would know more about this stuff. I should've grabbed a mage from Stackerâs to drag along with me. Oh well, should uh, could uh, would uh.
>Â Â Â 
> The tunnel is made of what appears to be old clay bricks. But, Iâm not entirely certain. I tried scratching the surface with my knife but didnât get anywhere with that. The entire tunnel is âlitâ somehow. I donât need my flashlight, but I can find any source of light.
>Â Â Â 
> After walking for a bit, Iâd say maybe 20 minutes. The floaty clay compass started to spin faster than normal. I still donât see any light sources but the tunnel is fairly lit. Just fine by me, that just means I donât have to crank my rechargeable flashlight as much.
>Â Â Â 
> I found something odd. Thereâs a lone wooden door in the middle of the tunnel. Not on the wall or the floor, or even the ceiling. Smack dab in the middle of the tunnel. I can walk around it and peer up above it. However, itâs firmly in the clay bricks and locked. I couldnât open the odd door no matter how much I tried.
>Â Â Â 
> I left the door behind and continued down the tunnel. I came across another large flat stone on the side of the tunnel. Iâm currently debating if I should tap the compass or continue down the tunnel further.
> 
> Curiosity got the best of me. I used Olâ Wind Charm rock to tap the flat stone. As expected it slowly made room for a way through, but what I find odd is how the flat brownstone quickly turned to red clay building bricks. They all look fairly new compared to the dirty brown bricks of the tunnel.
> 
> Okay, so I walked down the new path that opened up, and I ended up in the streets of bloody Manhattan! I was in Cuba before! There is no way I walked for several hours in a tunnel to end up on another side of the world. I don't need any more supplies, so Iâm going to try and head back into the tunnel.
> 
> Finding an entrance back into the tunnel took quite a bit of time I went down the ally way which I came, but it wasnât obvious where the entrance might be. I took the compass and began tapping parts of the alleyway. After a bit of trial and error, I finally tapped the lower right corner of the ally way. The bricks slowly moved into a position before making a doorway. I was scared I needed to fly back down to Cuba to get into the tunnel again.
> 
> The tunnel became the usual old brown bricks again after I entered. I plan to walk for another hour and set up a tent.

> **Entry #6**
> Okay, itâs the next morning. I think. My watch is going backward for some damn reason, and my phone died last night. Iâm not going to bother cranking up my portable charger. Time to pack down my tent and continue my exploration!
> 
> The tunnel went from being old clay bricks to a flat steel surface. It looks flawless and well maintained. Not a single speck of rust anywhere, which I find odd.
>Â Â Â 
> I found some muddy boot-prints on the flat steel surface. I guess other explorers are down here. Maybe I can meet up with them if I travel faster. It would be cool to meet up with others. However, I donât want to share knowledge of the potential treasure that Iâm looking for. I guess I wouldnât be opposed to sharing it if I met up with other people. But, the less that know about it the better I guess.
>Â Â Â 
> The tunnel opened up into a large metal room. Pipes and steam vents everywhere. The room has four pathways. Not sure which one to pick. My floaty rock isnât being helpful at the moment.
> 
> I figured it was best to just continue down the same direction I was going. The walls have since turned to pipes and steam vents. Every time I walk past one it begins to blow out hot air. Getting hit by one blast would ruin everything.
> 
> Nothing fun has happened for the last hour. The walls are still pipes and steam vents. I hope it changes soon. This would be a horrible place to set up a tent. Those blasted steam vents still concern the hell out of me.
> 
> More boot-prints! Although, they seem to be going in the opposite direction. I seriously hope Iâm going the right way. Maybe I should have gone down the other tunnel at the intersection. I guess Iâm going to continue in the same direction and hope for the best.
>Â Â Â 
> I found a large bronze skeleton key hanging from one of the pipes. I used a tent prop to bring it down. I think it might go to the odd door I found in the middle of the tunnel awhile back. Iâm going to head in that direction!
> 
> Okay. This place is bloody cursed. I walked back from the direction I came from, and it was no longer pipes and steam vents, but a glass floor with the walls being made of mirrors. Itâs so trippy having to walk down an entire hallway of mirrors. I think itâs making me sick.
> 
> I had to stop and rest. I didnât bother with my tent Iâm just gonna take a quick nap in my sleeping bag. Iâll write more later.

> **Entry #7**
> I woke up and the hallway is still just mirrors. Itâs rather creepy at this point. Iâm not sure how long I slept for as my watch has flat out stopped. I started walking for a bit, and I found a huge spider-web crack in one of the mirrors. I got no clue what the cause of it is.
>Â Â Â 
> I have no clue how long Iâve been walking for. An hour or two? My watch is still non-functioning. However, I am happy to report that the tunnel has since turned back old clay bricks. Iâm glad to have gotten out of the mirror hallway. I wonder if Iâll be able to find that lone door in the middle of the tunnel.
>Â Â 
> I found a body. Mangled and bloody. The poor guy is wearing an old blue style greatcoat, as well as a bandage across his face like a mummy. There are half a dozen bullet holes in his chest. Great, just bloody great. There are people down here with guns.
>Â Â 
> I stumbled into a large room with 12 massive painted portraits on the wall. They appear to be Greek Deities. One for each of the 12 Olympians. Iâm gonna stop here and charge my phone up. I want to get some pictures of these portraits.

> **Entry #8**
> As I was charging up my phone. A table appeared. I slowly went over to it, cautious at first. After I sat down a plate of pepperoni pizza appeared along with a glass of lemonade. It was exactly like how Stackerâs would make it. Which is perfect for me.
>Â Â Â 
> After the nice meal I finished charging up my phone. The portraits slowly faded away. Oh well, no digital proof today. Kinda a bummer.
> 
> I started walking back down the tunnel, keeping my eye out for that lone door. I swear this key is gonna be able to open it. I just got no clue how Iâm going to be able to find the door with how much this blasted tunnel keeps changing. Itâs like this place is a maze. Now that Iâm thinking about it.Â Â Thatâs exactly what this place is, a bloody fucking maze. At least it shouldnât be too hard to leave if I need to bail thanks to Olâ Wind Charm compass. Iâll have to buy her a drink or a dozen when I go back to Stackerâs next time.
>Â Â Â 
> I need a bloody break. I'm gonna play on my phone a bit. My feet are getting sore.

> **Entry #9**
> I crashed hard. Not sure how. The last thing I remember is leaning against the wall with my phone. I got no clue how long I slept for but I feel rejuvenated. Iâm still in the old clay brick style tunnel which is comforting. I hope that means I can find the lone door again. My floaty rock is just glowing. It hasnât moved in a while that I can remember. Not since I woke up at least.
> 
> I heard gunshots. A few dozen. I couldnât tell if it was coming from up ahead or from behind. I ducked down in the tunnel holding my hands over my head till I couldnât hear the shots anymore. Once I stood up I was in the middle of a large intersection. This âmazeâ changed right around me when I wasnât looking. I think it got me away from the present gunfire. So, thanks maze.
>Â Â Â 
> Olâ Wind Charm Compass began to float again! It started spinning backward after I picked one of the tunnels in the intersection I appeared in. So I started to backtrack and pick the tunnel the floaty rock was spinning towards. The tunnels have also changed again, but I like it this time. It has gone from the old clay bricks, bricks that look brand new.
> 
> My watch started ticking again. And it moving clockwise as well! At least now I can track time again. Itâs been giving me a migraine trying to figure out the passage of time here. Not knowing how long Iâve slept for has been rough too.
>Â Â Â 
> I came to a large brick staircase leading upwards. This is the first time the elevation has changed in the tunnels of the âMazeâ. At least it doesnât look super long.
> 
> Staircase was a short jog up. It leads to another brick tunnel but there seem to be windows. I can see outside - it's a beautiful forest of cherry trees. Dozens of them are outside the widows. The large pink petals are stunning to look at.
> 
> As I look out of each window, it's a different scenery. Some show a lush forest. One shows the towering mountain of Mt Fuji in the distance. I also saw a grand looking desert. Iâm not sure how I can look out these windows and see landscapes that should be thousands of miles away from each other. I know they are not photos, I could see movement from small forest creatures to people walking in the view of some of the windows. Nothing seemed to notice me though.
> 
> As I walked down the tunnel there were quite a few more windows. It would take far too long to document every scenery I saw. I think I may be counted 60 or so windows. No two had the same view. And all of them were within a few feet of each other.
> 
> After half an hour of walking the tunnel changed back to just bricks. It was nice being able to gaze into the outside world for a bit. But Iâm on a treasure hunt and Iâm determined to get it first.

**NOTE:** It appears multiple pages have been torn out of the journal. Examination of the journal's bindings suggest at least 5 pages were torn out.

> **Entry 10**
> My heart is racing! As I got out of my tent this âmorningâ it was staring me in the face! The lone door is right in front of me. I need to get my key out of my bag! This is such a great change compared to the long stressful journey of the last few days.
> 
> The key fits perfectly into the lock. As I pushed open the door I got hit with a blast of fresh air. I never realized how stale it was in this tunnel. The door opened up to a large room. I peered around the door and it was just brick tunnels. The door seemed to open a portal into a large room that appears to be made of silver bricks!Â Â This has to be the treasure room.
> 
> This room is massive. So far Iâve seen quite a few beautiful paintings and portraits on the wall. But nothing that speaks out to me as treasure. There is a door at the other end of the room. Hopefully that'll have something.
> 
> It was locked. I kind of figured. But, lucky for me the bronze skeleton key from before fit in perfectly.
> 
> The room. Was empty. Apart from maybe half a dozen old looking coins on the ground. There seem to be shoeprints in the dust, someone was here before me. These prints are not the same muddy boot-prints I saw earlier. Oh well, at least these old looking coins might be worth something.
> 
> I explored more of the room. In total, I found 16 old coins. Some are even made of gold! So this exploration wasnât a total waste of time. Iâm going to head back to the tunnel and try and find an exit out.
> 
> As I walked out of the lone door, it slowly began to sink into the brick floor. It made no sound which seemed a bit odd. Anyway time to head out, I canât wait to share this adventure with my father.

**Note**: Doctor Sphere is preparing a thaumaturgic rituals within a few days in order to try and discover what the contents of the missing pages would have been, as well as insight into who the journal's author might have been.

Several phrases written in a modified version of Ancient Greek were found inscribed within the margins of the journal. Efforts are currently underway to translate these inscriptions.

I think it's supposed to be some sort of poem - probably written by whoever made the maze, since it seems to describe the different components.

> This "Daedalus" (whether or not he is the real Daedalus, if such a person ever existed) clearly wanted to hide the core from the world at all costs. Why would he create a way to find it? If we wanted a way back in, couldn't he just make it allow him through? Also, why the hell would he need more than one compass (we've found at least 5 so far), and even more importantly, why would he spread them all over the world?
> 
> Someone else made these. The question is this: why would they need to find the core? Were they simply planning on shutting it down (and if they were, why?), or is there something (or someone) else at play here?

>Â Â Â Â 
> **11:** Ladies and Gentlemen. Welcome, I would like to apologize for this emergency meeting in advance, but there is a lot to get through. If you all read the brief in the message I sent this meeting is going to focus around a rather newly discovered anomalous entity: SCP-5000.
>Â Â Â Â 
> **3:** This soon? A meeting regarding an object that hasnât been thoroughly tested yet? Iâd say some rash decisions were made on your end, Jester.
>Â Â Â Â 
> **11:** While Iâll agree with you that nothing about this anomaly in question is fully know, nothing about this meeting was the cause of a rash decision. Iâve already been talking to Nine about this anomaly since MTF Zeta-9âs logs have been coming through. I would have held back normally, but Nine sent over some rather concerning information which has since put Zeta-9 on standby.
>Â Â Â Â Â 
> **5:** Well then, Nine. Would you be so kind as to explain what this information is?
>Â Â Â 
> **11:** Calm down Five, I was just getting to the-
>Â Â Â 
> **5:** No, Eleven. Iâm sick of information being passed through underhand notes. This is the 4th time Nine has brought up something concerning through the use of another council member.
>Â Â Â Â Â 
> //Silence was held for several seconds as O5-9 communicated with his interpreter.//
>Â Â Â Â Â 
> **9:** Eleven was doing just fine, he knows the crucial information for this meeting.
>Â Â Â Â Â 
> **5:** Typical. Just typical. Continue then, Eleven. If our Intelligence Director wishes to remain silent, then so be it.
>Â Â Â Â Â 
> **11:** As I was saying. So new information has come to light regarding a unique property of SCP-5000-A. It can manipulate time and space within itself, with reports of this ability's effects being drastically inconsistent.
>Â Â Â Â 
> **3:** And this is supposed to be grand and concerning? If I can recall correctly, there is quite a few extradimensional space SCPs that can manipulate time as it's perceived by whoever is inside them.
>Â Â Â 
> **6:** Indeed. While as concerning as this is, Eleven. What is this meeting specifically about.
>Â Â Â 
> **11:** Please I ask that you all have patient. Nine sent me quite a bit of information regarding SCP-5000. I promise there is a point to this meeting. But please allow me to finish explaining what I have to first. Not all of the information Nine and I have been sorting through is on SCP-5000âs file yet.
>Â Â Â 
> //Silence was held for several seconds.//
>Â Â Â 
> **11:** No complaints? Good. First of all. Originally We had been getting reports back from our MTF team far faster than we should. We retrieved multiple audio recordings that go through several days of data in a matter of hours. Zeta-9 has since been pulled out of SCP-5000A. Zeta-9 also brought back a journal log of some sort. As of right now, we are uncertain who is the author of this journal. Although, they are clearly quite invested with the Group of Interest known as Stackerâs Coffee House and Bar.
>Â Â Â Â 
> **3:** How much do they know about SCP-5000?
>Â Â Â 
> **11:** Nothing, from what the journal would suggest. It seems someone within Stacker's got this individual started on an adventure and it led to SCP-5000. With have reasons to believe that the people involved with the Group of Interest are largely unaware of the true nature of what SCP-5000 is.
>Â Â Â 
> **5:** Well then who does know about the true nature of SCP-5000? I know our friends at the GOC do. Wasnât the vote to allow a joint task force just last month?
>Â Â Â 
> //Silicene was held for several seconds as O5-9 communicated with his interpreter.//
>Â Â Â 
> **9:** Donât worry, Five. We are keeping a close watch to those with knowledge of this SCP.
> 
> **11:** Nine is correct as usual. Another notable trait SCP-5000-A has is it seems to be aware of who is within it. SCP-5000-A seemed to be increasingly hostile to our Task Force operatives. Putting them at odds with rival GoIs. Notably the Chaos Insurgency. While the author of the journal had a relatively easy exploration of the SCP, with reports of it outright helping and feeding the author of the journal.Â Â 
> 
> **5:** Are there any other sources with similar information? Or are we jumping to conclusions based on a simple journal that could be nothing but lies?
> 
> **11:** Sadly, we have no other source to verify this. Weâre making this assumption that the journal we found speaks the truth. But it's what's in the journal that's important. And based on that information, I have a new proposal: that being classifying SCP-5000, and by extension SCP-5000-A, from a Safe class, to a Archon class anomaly.
> 
> //Untranscribable murmuring was heard amount the Council members.//
> 
> **6:** Now what the hell does that have to do with anything? Archon means we can contain it but we shouldn't. Why should we avoid containing this?
> 
> **11:** I'm getting to that. We believe there are three major components of SCP-5000-A: the core, the labyrinth, and the treasure. The core is the most important part, and the labyrinth and the treasure are two ways to repel potential threats to it. The labyrinth hides it by constantly shifting and generates traps to turn attackers away. Other individuals with less malicious intent are turned away by the rumored treasure, as once they find it they'll have no reason to continue, so the labyrinth puts it in a place where they'll find it.
> 
> **3:** That doesn't explain why you think it should be Archon. What's the importance of the core that makes it so important to hide?
> 
> **11:** When our operative exited SCP-5000-A, several anomalous natural disasters took place simultaneously near known locations of entrances to 5000-A. In addition, according to her audio logs, she did not leave through conventional means - instead, she tried to shut down the core. Now, she believes it ejected her from whatever extradimensional space the labyrinth exists within while the core temporarily shut down, but we've determined it's actually more likely that she was ejected in an effort to prevent the core from shutting down. So, with this evidence, as well as what we found in the journal, we have come to a conclusion. SCP-5000-A was created by a figure known as Daedalus, who is believed to be the figure of the same name from Greek myth, and was created in an effort to hide the core, which maintains general normalcy within the world.
> 
> **5:** Wait, hang on. What the hell are you even saying?
> 
> **11:** Those anomalous natural disasters I mentioned weren't a coincidence - they were a direct result of the core's partial shutdown. I'm saying that when King Minos requested the creation of a prison, he was not imprisoning a minotaur. Daedalus created the labyrinth to hide the core - the only thing keeping the anomalous out of our world. When it was partially shut down, it briefly couldn't do that, and all the energy and deviations from normalcy it has been suppressing throughout its existence began to stream out. That's what caused the disasters. It came back online and began operating properly relatively quickly, but if it was down for any longer, we have no idea what could occur.
> 
> **6:** But even then, shouldn't we try to prevent anyone from going in? The compasses are still a thing.
> 
> **11:** Yes, we should absolutely monitor the entrances, but the least we do to contain it, the better. All that we should do is redirect people away from the labyrinth and confiscate as many of the compasses as we can. This thing has been operating properly for thousands of years - I say we let it continue uninterrupted.

**Note:** The O5 councilâs vote on reclassifying SCP-5000 as Archon class was approved 4 to 2 with 1Â Â abstaining. The O5 councilâs vote on authorization of the use of the Intelligence Agency to act out the termination of all non-Foundation personnel with knowledge relating to SCP-5000 was approved by a vote of 5 with 2 abstaining.
