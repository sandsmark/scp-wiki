**Item #:** SCP-771

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedure:** SCP-771 is to be held in a secure windowless containment cell at all times. No personnel is to enter SCP-771's cell, and any personnel attempting to release SCP-771 will be terminated, provided the consequences of their attempt does not kill them.

**Description:** SCP-771 is a computer A.I. that appears to be constructed out of both organic and mechanical components. The metal of SCP-771 is of unknown origin, and its biological components appear to be extremely damaged and only being kept together by the mechanical components. Due to this, SCP-771 cannot function properly, and will often repeat itself and break down when active.

When a biological creature comes within 20 feet of SCP-771, a swarm of small robots are released from a hatch on SCP-771's backside. These microbots target the spinal column, and proceed to "sting" the backbone, injecting a fluid that completely freezes all muscles in the body, but keeps the victim awake. 

Once frozen, the microbots proceed to dismember the body, cutting off large portions and bringing them back to SCP-771, attaching the pieces to the pre-existing biological components. Once the victim dies from blood loss, however, the microbots cease their dismemberment and retreat back to SCP-771. The harvested parts appear to only work for 12 hours, though, after which they fall off and are ignored.

Attempts at deactivating the microbots with electro-magnetic fields have resulted in SCP-771 also being deactivated, despite the field not even being close to SCP-771.
