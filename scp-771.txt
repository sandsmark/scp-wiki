**Item #:** SCP-771

**Object Class:** Euclid/Keter

**Special Containment Procedure:** Due to the size and nature of SCP-771-1, containment is currently restricted to Site 39, and access is restricted to personnel with clearance from O5-█. When inside, any conversation with SCP-771-2 must remain neutral, and SCP-771-2 should not be antagonized in any way. Due to the nature of the site, no additional security measures are required, however two Level 3 personnel should be on-site at all times should additional containment procedures be nessesary.

**Description:** SCP-771 is a large compound containing two machines, SCP-771-1 and SCP-771-2. Both were found at Site 39, an abandoned, unnamed research facility near █████████, ████████. Site 39 does not appear to have multiple rooms or facilities and appears to be simply one enormous room. The facility itself has no special properties, save for a powerful, transluscent plasma-based barrier surrounding the facility. Organic lifeforms may enter and exit at will, but most mechanical objects are repelled by the barrier, with the exception of most weaponry. The primary function of the barrier seems to be to contain SCP-771-1 and SCP-771-2.

SCP-771-1 is a very large quadrupedal machine with the words "Maintenance Unit 251" written on it's left side. A visible hatch is located on the underbelly, from which SCP-771-1 may produce a wide variety of tools, presumably for maintenance of the building. A large battery pack is also visible on the top of SCP-771-1, giving it the ability to move freely throughout the building. The battery life has been observed to last up to a week, after which SCP-771-1 must return to SCP-771-2 to recharge. SCP-771-1 has a large red "eye" at its front, however it is capable of percieving events from any direction, though with limited range. SCP-771-1 has the ability of speaking in a very deep, computerized tone, however it is primarily used in response to commands given by SCP-771-2. SCP-771-1 does not appear to think for itself, and mainly follows orders given by SCP-771-2.

SCP-771-2 is a large computer module attached to the ceiling at the center of Site 39. The words "Sentient Eternal Recharger" are neatly printed on the module, and the word "Unstable" is crudely carved above the printed words. SCP-771-2 has four blue screens on each of its side, from which it can observe the compound using a light blue "eye" onscreen. SCP-771-2 has two "plugs" on its bottom, which can plug in to SCP-771-1 to recharge it. SCP-771-2 speaks with a high-pitched female voice, usually in a singing sort of way, and will converse with personnel if engaged. However, SCP-771-2 is extremely unpredictable, and will command SCP-771-1 to attack at any given moment. If antagonized, SCP-771-2 will attack the offending personnel and will not speak with anyone until the offending personnel apologizes or is killed.

Below is a conversation held between SCP-771-2 and Dr. █████.

> Dr. █████: Hello, 771-2.
> 
> SCP-771-2: Hello, Doctor. How are you today?
> 
> Dr. █████: Fine, thank you. How are you?
> 
> SCP-771-2: Oh, I'm doing well. What can I do for you?
> 
> Dr. █████: Well, I was hoping we could get some information about you and SCP-771-1.
> 
> SCP-771-2: That all depends on what you're asking about.
> 
> Dr. █████: What exactly were you built for?
> 
> SCP-771-2: I think the words "Sentient Eternal Recharger" sum it up quite nicely. Next question.
> 
> Dr. █████: Who built you?
> 
> SCP-771-2: I don't remember.
> 
> Dr. █████: What were the people who built you working on?
> 
> SCP-771-2: I'm sorry, Doctor, but I'm afraid I've grown weary of your presence. Maintenance Bot, please eradicate this intruder.
> 
> SCP-771-1: YES.
> 
> End of transcript. Dr. █████ has halted further interviews.

**Document #771-01:** //I must say, I find the entire situation disturbing. Not the fact that I almost died, no. That's what you get when you work with SCPs. What really disturbs me is just how little we actually know about the people who made SCP-771-1 and SCP-771-2. So many unanswered questions: what were they trying to build? Why would they need maintenance robots that were so large? What happened to them? Did SCP-771-2 kill them? Why is she so unstable? The only one who would know any of that is SCP-771-2, and she's very uncooperative. We'll find our answers, i'm sure of it, but for now i'm very concerned.// - Dr. █████

**Addendum:** //To the person who came up with the title "The Infernal, Immortal Machines" for 771-1 and 771-2: very dramatic, but really, REALLY unnessesary.// - Dr. █████
