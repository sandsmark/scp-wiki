**Item #:** SCP-1301

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1301-1 and SCP-1301-2 are to be kept inside a secured, soundproofed box inside of a secured, soundproofed chamber. Absolute silence is to be maintained at all times within the holding chamber, and personnel will not be permitted entry into the chamber without the provided noise containment suits. Prior authorization is required to handle either SCP.

**Description:** SCP-1301-1 is a violin with no atypical distinguishing features or maker's label save for a distinctive crimson hue upon its body and scroll. Upon testing, it has been found that its strings are made of spider silk. SCP-1301-2 is the accompanying bow, constructed from pernambuco wood of a crimson hue identical to SCP-1301-1. Its ribbon is comprised of black, coarse horsehair, but in all other regards it appears to be of modern construction.

SCP-1301-1 is finely attuned to nearby vibrations; if jostled violently or exposed to nearby noise, its strings will sound audibly for 1 to 13 minutes unless otherwise muffled. Any personnel not holding SCP-1301-2 that are exposed to this sound firsthand are to be immediately quarantined and contained for study, owing to SCP-1301-1's effects. Recordings have consistently failed to capture sound from the object in this state.

Over the next 13 hours from initial exposure, affected individuals will slowly and permanently lose their ability to speak. Any attempts to do so will instead result in violin music emerging from the individual's mouth and throat, with pitches roughly corresponding to the range of their voice beforehand.

If SCP-1301-2 is used to produce vibrations from SCP-1301-1's strings, wordless voices will sing out, with their pitches matching the notes being played upon SCP-1301-1. The higher strings (A and E) generally produce female voices, and the lower strings (G and D) generally produce male ones; exceptions have been noted to occur. At infrequent intervals, SCP-1301-1 will instead scream and wail unintelligibly as it is played.

Though all noise from SCP-1301-1 stops if SCP-1301-2 is lifted from it, the pitches of SCP-1301-1's voices during these screaming phases do not correspond to the fingerings employed by the player. When using SCP-1301-2 in this fashion, the usual effects of exposure to SCP-1301-1 are dampened for 6 minutes after operation ceases, and experimentation has revealed that holding SCP-1301-2 grants immunity to SCP-1301-1's effects.
