**Item #:** SCP-1301

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1301-1 and SCP-1301-2 are to be kept inside a secured, soundproofed box inside of a secured, soundproofed chamber. Absolute silence is to be maintained at all times within the holding chamber, and personnel will not be permitted entry into the chamber without the provided noise containment suits. Prior authorization is required to handle either SCP.

Any personnel or individuals that are contaminated by SCP-1301-1 in its active state are to be immediately contained for study, owing to SCP-1301-1's effects.

**Description:** SCP-1301-1 is a violin of a distinctive crimson hue, lacking a maker's label or other sign of identification. Upon testing, it has been found that its strings are made of spider silk, and that its body is comprised of a variety of different woods, primarily spruce and maple.

SCP-1301-2 is a violin bow, constructed from pernambuco wood of a crimson hue identical to SCP-1301-1. Its ribbon is comprised of black, coarse horsehair, but in all other regards it appears to be of usual modern construction.

SCP-1301-1 is finely attuned to nearby vibrations; if jostled violently or exposed to nearby noise, it will enter its active state and its strings will sound audibly for 1 to 13 minutes unless otherwise muffled. Direct exposure to the sound produced during the object's active state will invariably result in contamination.

Over the next 13 hours from initial exposure, affected individuals will slowly and permanently lose their ability to speak. After this 13 hour period, the voice of a contaminated individual will have been replaced by shrill, dissonant violin music.

While held, SCP-1301-2 protects the individual holding it from SCP-1301-1's active state, though it does not reverse this state's effects. If SCP-1301-2 is used to produce vibrations from one or more of SCP-1301-1's strings, a voice singing the appropriate pitch will emerge instead. The higher strings (A and E) produce a timbre resembling female voices, and the lower strings (G and D) produce a timbre that mirrors male voices, though exceptions have been noted to occur outside of its anomalous state.

This singing state is not constant; while being operated with SCP-1301-2, SCP-1301-1 may instead enter its anomalous state and produce any one of a number of atypical effects, which have thus far included weeping, crying, screaming, laughing, and unintelligible whispering. The anomalous state of the object never exceeds 13 seconds in length.
