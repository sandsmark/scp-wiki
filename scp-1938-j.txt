**Item #:** SCP-1938

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to the risk of a TK-class Technological Regression Event, SCP-1938 is to be kept away from --computers-- --computing devices-- anything with a goddamn network interface at all costs.

**Description:** SCP-1938 is Dr. Mary-Ann Walker, a Level 2 anthropologist currently employed by the Foundation at Humanoid Containment Site 06-3 with the anomalous ability to infect any electronic device with a multitude of viruses, malware, and spyware within hours of use. SCP-1938 also has a catastrophic effect on the behavior of site information technology and security personnel, forcing them to laugh uncontrollably, break down into tears, then become incoherently angry at life (generally in that order).

This ability is suspected to be as a result of SCP-1938's inability to understand that all those retarded "click me" emails aren't actually telling you that you won some stupid prize or that a hundred puppies will die if you don't forward the goddamn thing.

SCP-1938 came to the attention Site 06-3's technical staff following an incident in which she reported sluggish computer performance and the responding technician reported that a cursory inspection of the affected terminal now contained a physically impossible amount of viruses.

**Addendum 1938-1:** Researcher Note

> As a reminder to all site staff, if you're gonna prank each other with this kind of stuff, to keep it to yourselves and not "accidentally" file personal documentation in the primary containment database.
> 
> And no, I'm not authorizing the request to ban Dr. Walker from the network. She needs to work, and you need to keep her terminal working.
