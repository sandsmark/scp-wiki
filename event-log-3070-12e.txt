SCP-2511-A instances sighted on 29514 Karatsu appear to be alive, and seemingly require no apparatus to survive in a vacuum environment. Each instance appears to have a tumorous growth on a limb, which resembles growths found on SCP-3070-1.

Microwave emissions (251 MHz) are intermittently released from the cranial region, which appear to be transmissions encoded in octal[[footnote]]The base-8 number system.[[/footnote]].
>

> 
> **Note:** The SCP-3070-A instances are believed to have a connection to Donald K. Cervantes, an owner of a scrap metal business specializing in cars in Portland, Maine. Interrogation with Cervantes has revealed no relation to SCP-3070 or other known anomalies, though he has several relatives working in the IAU.

> **Minor Planet:** 314612
>
> **3070-A Discovery Date:** 11-November-20██
> 
> **Description:** The asteroid possesses a visual appearance resembling heavily compressed JPEG image files, with changes in the compression artifacts occurring based on the angle it is viewed at. Studies of the surface show that the topography is unchanged and that the compression is non-corporeal. An investigation to determine if this is a cognitohazardous phenomenon is underway.
