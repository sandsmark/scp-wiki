**Item #:** SCP-2752

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Mobile Task Force Alpha-4 ("Pony Express") is tasked with the identification and interception of SCP-2752 instances before they are sent to the addresses of their respective recipients. A scanned copy of each recovered SCP-2752 instance is to be produced, and stored in Archival Sector 7 at Site-64. After scanning, original copies may be incinerated. 

If an SCP-2752-A instance is confirmed, it is to be detained in a humanoid containment cell at Site-64. SCP-2752-A instances are to undergo weekly medical checkups. At the discretion of the attending Medical Officer, invasive surgical procedures may be enacted on SCP-2752-A instances to prevent health complications attributed to SCP-2752. 

**Description:** SCP-2752 refers to a series of letters mailed to New Zealand addresses, offering advertising mail opt-out services to recipients. The sender is attributed to an organisation named 'Robinson Toʊ Liz', which is not listed as a registered company in New Zealand or any polity known to the Foundation. No return address is found in confiscated SCP-2752 instances. To date, all known instances of SCP-2752 are sent solely to male individuals aged between 20 to 60 and with legal addresses in New Zealand cities. Once SCP-2752 is read by its intended recipient, he becomes an instance of SCP-2752-A. Scanned or handwritten copies of SCP-2752 does not possess this effect on their intended recipient. 

The following anomalous occurrences are attributed to SCP-2752-A instances: 
* Cessation of mail letters (advertising mail or otherwise) sent to the address of SCP-2752-A instances. Through the use of letters equipped with a GPS tracker, letters are shown to have vanished when placed inside a mailbox. Hand-delivered mail letters are exempted from this effect. 
* Claircognizance regarding the contents of mail letters that would be sent to SCP-2752-A instances. This occurs after said letters are placed in a mailbox. 
* Traces of black dye manifested in SCP-2752-A's urinary system, particularly the kidney, bladder and urethra. 
* Manifestation of paper pieces inside SCP-2752-A's internal organs, including stomach, large intestines, lungs, kidney etc. 

The first known instance of SCP-2752-A was identified on ██/██/1974 in Auckland, New Zealand when multiple paper strips were found in its lungs after a surgery. While initially believed to be an isolated incident, other similar cases were identified in other New Zealand cities and SCP-2752 was officially classified. 

**Addendum 2752-1:** Interview Log 2752-A04-13 [Date: ██/██/1975]

> **Interviewee:** SCP-2752-A04 (Mr. Winston)
> 
> **Interviewer:** Dr. Aster Black 
> 
> **Foreword:** The following interview is conducted at SCP-2752-A04's request.
> 
> **<Begin Log>**
> 
> **Dr. Black:** Winston, I heard you have requested for me. So what's the issue? 
> 
> **SCP-2752-A04:** Doctor, 'wrong' is an understatement. I've received another letter... uh, up here. 
> 
> [SCP-2752-A04 points to its forehead.]
> 
> **Dr. Black:** Winston, we've debriefed on this already. This is a difficult time, but-
> 
> **SCP-2752-A04:** It was from Robinson Toʊ Liz. 
> 
> **Dr. Black:** Okay, I'm listening. What did they say? 
> 
> **SCP-2752-A04:** The usual 'thank you for using us' crap. But they sure have a weird way of expressing they have fucked up. 
> 
> **Dr. Black:** Please give me some examples of these expressions. 
> 
> **SCP-2752-A04:** That they didn't know that cellulose is indigestible, or that ink poisoning is a thing. And the biological peculiarities of the so-called humans of this plane, that was underlined and a direct quote. They also gave us compensation, a cheque with a very large sum of money in yen. 
> 
> **Dr. Black:** Do you recall the value?
> 
> **SCP-2752-A04:** Perfectly, all 12 digits. I can write it down for you, if you want. 
> 
> **Dr. Black:** Please do. 
> 
> **SCP-2752-A04:** Uh... but doctor... if this is anything like the rest of their so-called service, I'm not getting any real money, am I? 
> 
> **Dr. Black:** We will have to wait and see first. 
> 
> **<End Log>**
> 
> **Closing Statement:** Interviews with other SCP-2752-A instances indicate that they have received similar letters from 'Robinson Toʊ Liz'. The value offered by 'Robinson Toʊ Liz' is consistent among all SCP-2752-A instances, at a value of ¥960,000,000,000.

**Addendum 2752-2:** On ██/██/1975, postage stamps are found manifested underneath the tongues of all known SCP-2752-A instances. [[footnote]] This includes the corpses of currently deceased SCP-2752-A instances, with said stamps manifested from within the ashes of said instances. [[/footnote]] Denomination is stated as ¥960,000,000,000. Said stamps have a banana tree motif, and are labelled "Dai-tō-a – Malai Baru". 

No anomalous quality has been identified among recovered stamps. All instances of said postage stamps are provisionally kept in Storage Sector 2 at Site-64, and slated for incineration.
