**Item #:** SCP-1258

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** All materials relating to SCP-1258 are held in a locked document cabinet in Site-19, with access restricted to clearance level 4 and above. Any organisms showing any effect of practicing SCP-1258 should be considered an instance of SCP-1258-1 and terminated immediately unless part of an approved experiment. Standard Foundation searches for anomalous animal activity should be cross-referenced with SCP-1258 markers.

**Description:** SCP-1258 is a martial art of unknown origin. Currently the Foundation has in its possession enough material in varying media to reconstruct several basic forms used to teach beginners, but little information on more advanced forms. SCP-1258-1 is any organism which has the knowledge and capability of practicing SCP-1258 independently.

When SCP-1258 is practiced by human beings, there is no observed anomalous effect. The anomalous effects of SCP-1258 manifest when movements of the style are performed within view of a non-human mammal. A mild compulsive effect causes all such animals to cease any non-essential activity and begin watching the performer. After a short period of passive observation, animals will begin attempting to duplicate the movements, to the extent they are able. Due to anatomical differences, some animals are more capable than others of imitating the movements of SCP-1258, but regardless of skill, animals will continue practicing until either they are distracted by a pressing need (the need to eat, imminent danger, etc.) or the human performer stops or leaves their field of view.

If an animal is permitted to observe and mimic SCP-1258 forms for a period of time[[footnote]]Even a single exposure to SCP-1258 may be enough to cause these anomalous developments. Exact period of exposure necessary depends on multiple factors, including the species of subject, time spent performing, the skill of the human performer, and so forth. See Experiment Log below for further information.[[/footnote]], they will begin to develop human-like characteristics. Generally the process begins at the level of gross anatomy: quadrupedal organisms will develop leg musculature for a bipedal stance, they will develop opposeable thumbs on their hands or equivalent structures, and will develop in size and stature to a minimum standing (bipedal) height of approximately 1 meter. (Animals already larger than this will stay the same size, though they will develop other quasi-human features.) Additionally, virtually all animals will develop larger brains, with expansion most often seen in areas relating to language.[[footnote]]These transformations require vastly increased nutritional intake, beyond what a healthy specimen should be able to consume normally. It is theorized SCP-1258 also speeds up metabolic processes in such a way as to allow for this high rate of growth. Without adequate nutrition, subjects' growth will be retarded, but will progress.[[/footnote]] Subjects will continue to practice SCP-1258, even in the absence of an instructor or any materials related to SCP-1258; they may display knowledge of forms and movements which they have not been previously exposed to.[[footnote]]This anomalous knowledge is theorized to be another side-effect of exposure to SCP-1258.[[/footnote]] Continual exposure will cause further expansion and development along these lines, and eventually development of the vocal cords (or equivalent structures), jaw, and esophagus. After enough exposure, subjects will be able to communicate verbally in human languages.[[footnote]]Generally, animals will have access to the language and vocabulary they were exposed to prior to their development by SCP-1258; for example, an animal raised by a English speaker will have retroactively "learned" the English they heard their owner speaking. Furthermore, most animals also show language acquisition skills comparable to a human toddler, allowing them to learn at an accelerated rate.[[/footnote]] Subjects' intelligence will increase appreciably as they continue to practice SCP-1258 routines and forms, usually to between 110 and 140 I.Q. as measured by standard Foundation tests. Eventually, test subjects will refuse to cooperate with humans in any capacity and will begin attempting to escape confinement by any means.

**Addendum: Origins of SCP-1258:** The time and exact place of origin of SCP-1258 are unknown. Some of its forms are superficially similar to the Korean martial art //taekkyeon//, which may place its development as early as the beginning of the Three Kingdoms Era (57 C.E.); however, due to taekkyeon's resurgence following the end of the Japanese occupation of Korea in 1945, and the cross-pollination between many East Asian martial arts, SCP-1258 may be a much more recent development, or may be of entirely different origin. Further investigation is impossible barring the discovery of more material.

[[collapsible show="+ Experiment Log" hide="- Experiment Log"]]
**Experiment Log:** A summarized version of the experiment log for SCP-1258 is given below; a full log can be found in the document cabinet in Site-19.

**Procedure:** In order to minimize exposure to and potential outbreaks of SCP-1258, a Foundation agent with experience in multiple forms of martial arts was given access to all materials related to SCP-1258. The agent practiced multiple forms until performance was satisfactory. The agent was recorded performing all known forms and movements, then given targeted class-B amnesiacs to remove all knowledge of SCP-1258.[[footnote]]Despite these precautions, the agent was seen using forms similar to SCP-1258 one month later, during a raid on a Church of the Broken God group. Presumably this was due to muscle memory, or perhaps subconscious retention. Agent was eliminated to prevent uncontrolled spread.[[/footnote]] These recordings were then played back to groups of animals of varying species.

**Species:** //Canis lupis familiaris//, domestic dog, varying breeds, thirty-seven specimens (twenty-five males, thirteen females).
**Exposure time:** Ten minutes per hour, eight hours per day. One specimen killed and autopsied at end of each day.
**Results:** All specimens began watching immediately. Twenty-nine specimens attempted to copy movements during first exposure; all individuals copied movements during second exposure. Increased appetite following first day; additional protein and other supplements provided. Further increases needed on following days. Alterations in gross musculature seen following day seven. Alterations in bone structure seen following day twelve. Increased cranial diameter and altered vocal cords seen following day fourteen. Modified I.Q. test was presented on day fourteen; average score was 77.
**Notes:** Experiment was forced to terminate prematurely. On day fifteen, one specimen displayed unexpected agitation and aggression. When handlers entered the containment area to remove the specimen, all specimens attacked simultaneously. Emergency lockdown procedures enacted immediately; all specimens killed via nerve gas. Autopsies were consistent with observed results.

**Species:** //Rattus norvegicus//, laboratory rat, forty-two specimens (twenty-six males, sixteen females). Normal nutritional supplement for a colony of this size was initially tripled.
**Exposure time:** Ten minutes per hour, eight hours per day. One specimen killed and autopsied at end of each day.
**Results:** All specimens began watching immediately. Twenty specimens attempted to copy movements during first exposure; thirteen additional specimens copied movements during second exposure; all specimens copied movements during third exposure. Alterations in gross musculature seen following day ten. Alterations in bone structure seen following day thirteen. Population randomly sorted into two groups following day thirteen; control group received no further exposure, while experiment group continued standard exposure. Control group continued to perform SCP-1258 movements despite lack of exposure. Both groups showed continued physical development, though control group's development was comparatively slower. (More precise data can be found in detailed experiment log.) Modified I.Q. tests presented to both groups on day twenty-two; control group averaged 63, while experiment group averaged 74. By day twenty-seven, experiment group was communicating largely in spoken English and was overheard planning escape from containment.
**Notes:** Experiment was terminated prematurely due to concerns over possible escape.

**Species:** //Myotis californicus//, California bat, seven specimens (six females, one male). Normal nutritional supplement for a group of this size was initially tripled.
**Exposure time:** Ten minutes per hour, eight hours per day. One specimen killed and autopsied at end of each week.
**Results:** All specimens began watching immediately. All specimens attempted to copy movements during first exposure, although movements were noticeably impaired by wing membranes. Major alterations in musculature, skeletal system, and cranial size seen following week one. By day eight, four of the remaining specimens were unable to fly due to diminished wing membranes; by day nine the other two had similarly lost flight capability. Two specimens showed bipedal movement on day ten; by day eleven all specimens were walking bipedally. Specimens began functioning during daylight hours on day twelve. Alterations in eye structure and vocal cords seen following week two. Specimens became fully diurnal on day fifteen. Subjects were conversing in English on day sixteen, though only in ultrasonic frequencies.
**Notes:** Experiment was treated prematurely. On day nineteen, ultrasonic microphones in the containment area unexpectedly failed. Armed response team was sent in to repair the microphones. They were attacked by the SCP-1258-1 instances and drove them away with flamethrowers and controlled small-arms fire. Three of the team then expired from no apparent cause, and the remaining member became agitated and incoherent. The containment area was flooded with nerve gas, and all specimens were killed. Autopsies of the team members showed massive disruption to their eardrums and hemorrhaging in their brains; it is believed the SCP-1258-1 instances used an ultrasonic attack to induce strokes.

**Species:** //Trioceros jacksonii//, Jackson's chameleon, three specimens (two females, one male). Normal nutritional supplement for a group of this size was initially tripled.
**Exposure time:** Ten minutes per hour, eight hours per day.
**Results:** No changes noted. Specimens showed no particular interest in recordings. After fifteenth day of continual exposure, experiment terminated.

**Species:** //Salmo salar//, Atlantic salmon, five specimens (five females). Normal nutritional supplement for a group of this size was initially tripled.
**Exposure time:** Ten minutes per hour, eight hours per day.
**Results:** No changes noted. Specimens showed no particular interest in recordings. After fifteenth day of continual exposure, experiment terminated.

**Species:** //Bombus occidentalis//, Western bumblebee, one colony (exact number unknown). Normal nutritional supplement for a colony of this size was initially tripled.
**Exposure time:** Ten minutes per hour, eight hours per day.
**Results:** No changes noted. Specimens showed no particular interest in recordings. After thirtieth day of continual exposure, experiment terminated.

**Species:** //Giraffa camelopardalis tippelskirchi//, Maasai giraffe, two specimens (two males). Normal nutritional supplement for a group of this size was initially tripled.
**Exposure time:** Ten minutes per hour, eight hours per day.
**Results:** [REDACTED]
**Notes:** Experimentation on large mammals expressly forbidden without special permission from the O5 Council.

[[collapsible show="+ Recovery Log" hide="- Recovery Log"]]
**Recovery Log:** SCP-1258 was first discovered as part of a routine internet search for anomalous artifacts, events, or persons. On █/██/201█, the YouTube channel of user 'WayFyre91,' real name Isaac Waymire, was found. Of the thirty-seven (37) videos on Waymire's channel, the first thirty-three (33) were of no value.[[footnote]]Major topics included Waymire reviewing films or video games, responding to friends' videos, or diary-style entries about his personal life.[[/footnote]] In the thirty-third video, Waymire mentioned that he had begun taking martial arts lessons at a nearby school. The remaining 4 videos had been made within the space of roughly three (3) months. Transcripts of some of the relevant videos follow.[[footnote]]Dialogue has been translated from the original German.[[/footnote]]

> **0:00:25-0:00:38:** [Waymire briefly steps off-camera, returning with Caesar in his arms. He places Caesar on the floor.]
> 
> **0:00:38-0:02:15:** [Waymire performs an SCP-1258 routine. Caesar begins watching Waymire immediately. At 0:00:44, Caesar stands on his hind legs and begins imitating Waymire's movements. His balance appears to be poor and his range of motion is limited, but he attempts to follow the remainder of Waymire's routine. At the conclusion of his practice, Waymire begins laughing. He feeds a treat to Caesar, then picks him up and faces the camera.]

> 
> **Notes:** Due to the montage editing of this video, it is impossible to tell in what order the original sequences were filmed. However, Caesar is seemingly larger and has more developed musculature in his front and back legs. In certain shots, it appears that his muzzle is elongated as well, though the low resolution makes this difficult to verify.

> **0:00:27-0:01:44:** [Camera pans away from Waymire's face. The door to his bedroom is slightly ajar, and the camera is placed to sight into the bedroom. Caesar can be seen practicing an SCP-1258 form. Foundation martial arts experts note that this form is more advanced than had been seen in previous videos. Caesar is also noticeably larger, and has a much steadier bipedal stance.]

> **0:00:00:** [Video opens on Caesar, in Waymire's bedroom. Waymire is not seen in the video; presumably he is holding the camera. Caesar is approximately twice his original size. His limbs are heavily muscled, and the skin has stretch marks, presumably from rapid growth. He is standing in what appears to be a basic SCP-1258 stance.]

> 
> **0:02:23-0:02:28:** [Caesar stops speaking but continues to stare at the camera. Waymire's breathing can be heard as well.[[footnote]]According to Foundation analysis, Waymire's labored breathing is probably due to an agitated emotional state, although he may also have suffered damage to his throat, lungs, or thoracic cavity.[[/footnote]]]
> 
> **0:02:29-0:02:31: Waymire:** Is—is that enough? Can I—
> 
> **0:02:31:** [Caesar moves forward in a threatening manner. Camera jerks, likely due to Waymire flinching.]
> 
> **0:02:32-0:02:45: Caesar:** You ... will not ... ask! You will ... tell ... the masters! They ... must know.
> 
> **0:02:46-0:02:51:** [Camera holds steady on Caesar until end of video.]

Using the IP address Waymire had uploaded the videos from and clues within the videos themselves, the Foundation traced him to the town of █████████, Germany. Waymire was found dead in his apartment, with time of death approximately two days prior. Cause of death was determined to be blunt force trauma indicative of physical confrontation. Both of Waymire's legs and his right arm had been broken, along with seven ribs, and most of his internal organs were severely damaged or ruptured. Waymire's jaw was broken in several places, including two apparently post-mortem breaks.

Foundation agents followed reports of attacks on hikers, as well as sightings of a "standing wolf" or "hairy dwarf", to a forest roughly east of █████████. The bodies of two hikers with wounds similar to Waymire's were found approximately seventeen kilometers from the city. Their bodies had been dragged into a small stream and partially eaten. Caesar, now designated SCP-1258-1-01, was eventually located and confronted after a three-day pursuit. Two agents were killed and four more injured; SCP-1258-1-01 was shot and killed.

**Addendum: Document 1258-RX:** In January 201█, multiple incidents of wild animals attacking humans were reported in the town of ██████████, Colorado, USA. Some victims reported packs made up of multiple species, including predator and prey species together. The Foundation investigated and found widespread usage of SCP-1258. Sterilization of all wild and domesticated animals within a fifty-kilometer radius of the city, under guise of response to a rabies outbreak, was carried out without incident. Investigation led to a recently-opened dojo within the city; however, the dojo had burned down several days prior to the Foundation response.[[footnote]]The cause of the fire was unclear.[[/footnote]] No unremarkable equipment was found in the dojo, and most documents were burned beyond retrieval. The only recoverable fragment of note has been classified as document 1258-RX, and appears to be a handwritten, incomplete translation into English of another document. The original document, if one existed, was not found.
