**Item #:** SCP-370  A Key

**Object Class:** Keter 

**WARNING:**  //SCP-370 is a memetic threat of the highest level.  No cases of personnel being infected simply from reading this article have yet been recorded, but nevertheless as a precaution this document may only be read in a controlled environment with mechanisms in place to terminate the reader at the first sign of infection.  Spreading any information about SCP-370 by word of mouth is grounds for immediate termination.// -O5-█

**Special Containment Procedures:**

SCP-370 itself is embedded in a small slab of solid lead and kept inside a solid steel box with no openings and 0.5 meter thick walls. Under no circumstances is SCP-370 to be removed from either this box or the lead slab.   If SCP-370 is for any reason partially or completely exposed, blindfolded personnel must locate it with a metal detector and dump molten lead over it; once SCP-370 is once again completely encased in lead it may be safely recovered and returned to its wielded steel box.

This box is kept in a specially designated vault at Site-██. SCP-370 requires no maintenance whatsoever and no research is authorized -- any staff attempting to open the vault or requesting to perform research on SCP-370 should be assumed infected and terminated immediately.  If the need ever arises for SCP-370 to be transferred to another site, all members of the transportation team must be committed atheists and only D-Class with confirmed violent tendencies should come in direct contact with the steel box.

SCP-370 may or may not be destructible, however testing is absolutely forbidden as there is some risk of creating more directly infected subjects and the physical existence of  SCP-370 is no threat so long as it is never removed from its lead slab and steel containment box.

Any doctors or researchers assigned to SCP-370 who show a sudden improvement in overall well-being should be isolated in case of infection.  If any of them remain cheerful despite this isolation they are almost certainly infected and should be terminated.

Anyone who appears to be radiating a faint golden light should be shot on sight or otherwise terminated by any means available, regardless of rank or security clearance.

**Description:**
SCP-XXX is a key of unknown size and shape, made of unknown metal and covered with intricate etched illustrations and unknown words in an unknown language.  Any knowledge of SCP-370’s physical characteristics beyond this causes infection.
SCP-370 infection has three distinct forms of expression, depending on the intelligence, disposition and religious faith of  the infected individual.

-  Subjects described as self-centered or cowardly (most commonly religious agnostics) will display no signs at all upon initial infection, but will commit suicide the first time an opportunity to do so relatively painlessly arises.  The infected corpse will then glow brilliantly and undergo an unknown transformation before vanishing without a trace -- detailed knowledge of the transformation spreads the infection, as does direct visual contact with the light produced.  The vanishing is reportedly accompanied by the sound of wings, this sound seems to be a non-contagious element.

- Subjects with violent tendencies and casually held religious beliefs (including most atheists) will become extremely calm upon infection.  After several seconds they will scan their surroundings, seize a weapon if such is available, and begin systematically murdering everyone within reach, all the while smiling and exuding what has been described as ‘a sense of deep inner peace.’  Persons killed by the infected subject will glow brightly and undergo an unknown transformation, presumably the same or similar to that of the suicides.

Initially the infected subject is no more dangerous than an ordinary violent human, however after approximately two (2) to three (3) kills the subject’s body with begin to radiate a golden light that has a calming effect, making it difficult for victims to fight back.  After approximately five (5) to six (6) kills, the glow becomes a harsh light and the direct skin-to-skin  contact becomes deadly.  At this point any eye contact with the victim will spread the infection.

After approximately twelve (12) kills the subject will abruptly cease attacking, raise its arms skyward and shout in an abnormally amplified voice, “████ take me home!”  Hearing this, or even knowing the full phrase spreads the infection.

At this point a shaft of light forms around the subject, who will then levitate several feet above the ground before [REDACTED] and vanishing completely.  Since this mode of infection is most obvious and can easily be contained by terminating the subject at first sign of homicidal tendencies, personnel likely to be affected in this way are preferred in working with SCP-370

- Highly intelligent subjects or subjects of devote religious faith will close their eyes and remain quiet for approximately thirty seconds upon infection. When questions on this they respond that they were praying.  This first sign is very subtle and usually missed.

After the initial infection  subjects will behave as normal, but will seem much happier than normal even when forced into unpleasant conditions.   Infected subjects become aware of all SCP-370’s characteristics regardless of having actually seen it and will carefully slip this infectious knowledge into conversations, or otherwise act to spread the infection (for example trying to breach containment on SCP-370’s vault or add infectious information to this document.)

After about fifty successful infections the air around the subjects begins to subtly shine, creating a ‘halo’ effect.  At this point simply looking at the subject has a █% chance of spreading infection.  Within about a day of this shine appearing, whether or not any further infections have occurred, a flaming [DATA EXPUNGED] burn marks on any surfaces it touched or passed through and leaving no trace of the infected subject.  This event leaves behind an invisible patch of contagious  space which infects anyone who passes through it and does not fade for  approximately two (2) weeks.

**Addendum:**

The circumstances of SCP-370’s original retrieval are unknown.  It was found in the ruins of Site-█, a remote Foundation base in eastern ████.  These containment protocols in their original form and the described steel box were found in a sealed vault along with a single corpse, identified as Dr. █████, a known Satanist.  The rest of the site was abandoned and no other dead bodies were found, although signs of struggle were ubiquitous.  The rest of the site’s stored data on SCP-370 had been erased or destroyed,  although a few useful notes on other SCPs were recovered, particularly SCP-███.  

Several infection events occurred during recovery efforts, however these were handled with extreme prejudice and the infection was believed extinct. SCP-370 was briefly designated ‘Safe’.  However, in light of recent [DATA EXPUNGED] Keter designation has been restored and anti-memetic security has been tightened throughout all Foundation sites.
