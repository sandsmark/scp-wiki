[[tab Performance Review]]
> Andrew is certainly an interesting man. He is uniquely qualified for his position (indeed, almost absurdly so, to the point that one must wonder where he obtained these "degrees") as ████████ of the Metanormal Occurrences Committee of ████-██ and performs his duties well by all accounts. Mr. Specter does, however, have a tendency to be excessively belligerent when discussing his studies and/or objects of interest. During the worst example of this behavior, he cornered a junior researcher in the break room and lectured them about the merits of ghosts in literature for three hours. While this kind of passion for his work is inspiring, we all could do with a lot //less// inspiration in the future.
