**Item #:** SCP-5799

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Foundation personnel stationed in the city of Rexburg are to suppress any knowledge of SCP-5799's existence to the general public. Likewise, field agents are to be stationed in dental clinics and report any young adults suffering from toothaches of any form.

Field agents proficient in the field of dentistry and oral hygiene must extract any teeth that may cause physical ailments in the affected adolescent. Extracted teeth are then analysed by the dental auxillaries of MTF-Upsilon-8 ("Cavity Creeps")[[footnote]]A task force specialized in dental hygiene to combat orthognathic anomalies.[[/footnote]] to determine if these teeth are viable SCP-5799 instances. Upon extraction of these entities, agents are to disseminate amnestics to the individuals involved and their families with cover stories implemented as an explanation for the missing teeth.

Any active SCP-5799 instances in the wild are to be contained whenever possible. Any SCP-5799-1 instances encountered are to be detained and terminated while sending cover stories to the families of the hosts for an explanation their disappearance[[footnote]]This is due to the growing or fully grown SCP-5799 instances becoming increasingly difficult to excise from the host and rendering extraction of these instances an impractical ideal.[[/footnote]].

**Description:** SCP-5799 are groups of human teeth (six or more) exhibiting autonomous motion and predatory behavior. Despite being made of enamel, SCP-5799 instances display abnormal malleability and actively stretch out in length; in this way, SCP-5799 entities are able to move and traverse to different locations.

SCP-5799 entities can detect the presences of human beings. SCP-5799 displays a preference for young teens and adults ranging between 15 to 22 years of age and will usually ignore human beings younger or older than that range in a 15m radius. Upon their discovery, SCP-5799 instances will immediately rush to the individual for capture. SCP-5799 will then restrain the individual with their roots and forcibly remove their teeth and implant themselves in the individual's mouth.

Three hours after replacing the individual's teeth, the affected host[[footnote]]Designated SCP-5799-1.[[/footnote]] will begin displaying physical malleability around their head and facial area. SCP-5799-1's muscles will begin to spasm into a permanent //risus sardonicus//[[footnote]]Rictus grin; a muscle spasm that causes the individual to smile uncontrollably.[[/footnote]] and suffer from occasional bouts of uncontrollable laughter. As the time between episodes of laughter decreases, the teeth of the afflicted will grossly enlarge to ludicrous sizes to the point that their head is no longer visible[[footnote]]Despite their apparent size, SCP-5799-1 instances are still capable of supporting the weight of the enlarged teeth with little to no difficulty.[[/footnote]]. The malleability in the infected entity's muscles and bone allows the instance's facial structure to distort without any tearing or breaking.

SCP-5799 entities will inhabit the host's mouth for up to 12 days, growing in size and shape, up until the final day of their life cycle when the instance immediately rots. Upon death, the instance's corpse will burst and spawn approximately 20 instances of itself resembling deciduous teeth[[footnote]]Commonly known as baby teeth.[[/footnote]]. Humans that were affected by SCP-5799's infection will still have their face and head permanently altered by SCP-5799's growth.

**Discovery:** SCP-5799 was discovered in the city of Rexburg, Idaho after reports of missing children returned to their families with distorted faces and enlarged teeth. [[[SCP-1990-EX|MTF-Xi-3 ("Body Snatchers")]]] were then sent to the appropriate locations to capture all SCP-5799-1 instances and administered amnestics to the hosts' families.

Prior to their discovery, field agents also reported flyers and pamphlets being passed around in the local church and rehabilitation centers regarding a "teeth strider infestation." The following transcript below is an example of one of the flyers received:
