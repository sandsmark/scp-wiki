**Item #:** SCP-317

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:**  SCP-317 is to be housed in modified large-mammal quarters measuring 6m x 6m, equipped with an oxygen tank and enhanced fire-suppression systems. Because it is non-violent, SCP-317 is permitted to leave its quarters, eat in the main cafeteria, and wander freely in non-classified areas if accompanied by two (2) guards at all times; should SCP-317 become unruly or dangerous, its inhaler is to be deactivated. SCP-317 is allowed free access to unclassified research material from the on-site academic library; all material selected for study by SCP-317 should be recorded, as should requests for access to classified material.

Although SCP-317 is permitted to converse with personnel about unclassified subjects, it is not permitted to hold formal interviews. It is not in a position of authority here, and should be discouraged from thinking otherwise.

SCP-317 is not permitted access to electronics supplies.

**Description:** SCP-317 is a sapient female dinosaur of a previously-unknown species of pachycephalosaurid. Subject is bipedal and 3m tall, and can lift +200 kg with ease. Subject is largely herbivorous and has prehensile digits. Subject's metabolism is adapted to a higher atmospheric oxygen content, and therefore subject wears a respirator device when not in its quarters.

Biochemical analysis (rhodopsins, mitochondria, homeobox genes, cytochrome P450) confirms that SCP-317 shares common ancestry with current Earth life.

SCP-317 claims to be a [REDACTED] and physicist, and to have traveled approximately 67 million years in a time machine; subject has described the time machine as being damaged far beyond its ability to repair without specialized equipment and a team of highly-trained coworkers.

SCP-317 has openly expressed its intent to "eventually" fix its time machine, return to its own era, and prevent the extinction event which destroyed its civilization, its species, and 98% of its biosphere; however, SCP-317 has also expressed a profound fascination for this time period, and has stated that it would be "a shame" to eliminate humans from history without first learning as much as possible about the zoology and botany of this geological epoch. Psychological assessment indicates a 70% likelihood that this is a form of denial; a greater degree of accuracy would require access to other members of SCP-317's species, to serve as a basis for comparison.

Since entering Foundation custody, SCP-317 has acquired conversational familiarity with English.
