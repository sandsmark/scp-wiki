**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:**  SCP-317-1 is to be preserved in a vat of liquid nitrogen. Requests for tissue samples from SCP-317 must be made in writing.

**Description:** SCP-317-1 is the remains of a sapient female dinosaur of a previously-unknown species of pachycephalosaurid. Subject was bipedal and 3 m tall, and could lift +200 kg with ease. Subject was largely herbivorous, and had prehensile digits. Subject's metabolism was adapted to a higher atmospheric oxygen content, and therefore subject wore a respirator device when not in its quarters.

Biochemical analysis (rhodopsins, mitochondria, homeobox genes, cytochrome P450) confirms that SCP-317-1 shared common ancestry with current Earth life.

In the four months between its arrival in Foundation custody, and its death from a lactobacillus infection, SCP-317-1 learned to communicate via a combination of sign language, crude vocalizations, and drawings; video archive 317-B-36 shows interview sessions with SCP-317-1. Drawings made by SCP-317-1 are available in archive 317-B-42.

SCP-317-2 is the personal effects of SCP-317-1: clothing, a tool belt, six tools, eyeglasses, a document pouch and its contents, and three electronic devices whose purpose has not been determined.

SCP-317-3 is the fire-damaged remains of what is believed to have been a time machine.

**Note:** //There's something wrong with this one, people. A technological civilization should have left **some** trace in the stratigraphic record. Where are the fossils?//
