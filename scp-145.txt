**Item #:** SCP-145

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-145 is to remain inside its room at all times, in its container unless being studied. Room is to be thoroughly soundproofed and securely locked when studies of SCP-145 are not in progress. Under no circumstances shall any personnel come into physical contact with SCP-145 without being accompanied and constantly observed by one or more other personnel. Any personnel showing signs of intense psychological trauma must be immediately escorted out of the containment area. Depending on the level of trauma of affected personnel, they may be required to submit to consultation with an approved psychiatrist for no less than two weeks.

**Description:** SCP-145 appears to be a standard 2002-model cordless telephone handset of Alcatel brand that is missing its charging base. Serial number and production date are unavailable. Upon answering the phone, which rings constantly when unanswered without exception, a voice can be heard speaking through the phone. The voice, which frequently varies, is most commonly that of a panicked young female. Each time the phone is answered, the voice details the sound of a person undergoing brutal torture. The methods of torture implied thus far (judging from the phrases and reactions of those speaking at the time of contact) have included branding, electrocution, laceration, sexual assault, disfigurement by unknown means, blunt trauma, and lashing from a whip or similar implement. 

Initial speculation that the caller was merely conducting a prank was quickly dispelled upon realization that the item continued operation despite the removal of its internal power supply. The callers appear to be non-automated and entirely sentient. Attempts to trace the call or track down the location of the tortured callers have proven unsuccessful thus far. Attempts to block the signal of the phone with the use of a Faraday cage have also been unsuccessful.

Research is conducted in teams of at least three (one Class D staff, one Class 2/145 audio technician, and one Class 3 security staff), with only Class D staff permitted to have direct auditory contact with SCP-145's transmissions. In the event a subject comes into contact with SCP-145 unaccompanied, the subject making contact will vanish instantly. As this happens, the phone will simply fall to the floor. The phone does not appear to have sustained damage from any of these falls thus far. Subsequent communication with the object has revealed that vanished subjects join the group of torture victims.
