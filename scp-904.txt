**Item #:** SCP-904

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-904 should be inscribed on an ordinary sheet of typing paper when not in active observation or study. This paper should be secured in a secure locked non-combination vault and stored out of range of any recording devices. SCP-904 should only be handled or directly viewed by class-D personnel without backgrounds in literature, writing, or art.

**Description:** SCP-904 was discovered written on a bathroom wall in the literature department of ████████ University, after reports of unusual behavior and difficulty speaking in students and professors in the department. Three agents and four researchers were infected by inadvertent exposure to SCP-904 or auditory infection, although it transported to Site-██ without further incident.

Infection from SCP-904 presents a slight memetic hazard to all who read it, but it is only harmful to those with a specific creative-type mindset. An infected individual can infect other individuals. Symptoms include the tendency to use end rhymes uncontrollably, in all speech. Reading SCP-904 multiple times, or being very close to it after reading it once, will result in the development of a more refined poetic form, containing iambic pentameter, a more complicated poetic form, or more fitting rhymes.

The infection is not permanent. Some individuals will remain affected for up to twenty four hours, while others will shake off the infection within ten minutes. Typically, infections caught from other individuals will be shorter in duration then infections from the source. 

However, some individuals, mostly those with backgrounds in poetry and the arts, are more adversely affected by the infection. These individuals have a more difficult time losing the infection. In rare cases, it will not subside, but will induce a state of extreme depression and the feeling that they are unable to express their thoughts, and often result in the subject’s self-termination. Researchers should use discretion when choosing who will view SCP-904.

**Addendum 1:**  A class-D personnel was exposed to SCP-904 and successfully infected. When asked to use a sentence ending in the word “ninth” (a word with no rhymes in the English language), [DATA EXPUNGED].
At the request of the cleaning crews assigned to clean up the blood, researchers are strongly discouraged from similar experiments.

**Addendum 2:** If this ever breaks containment, we’re going to be facing a disaster, suicidal poets or not. –Doctor █████
