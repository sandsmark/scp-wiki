> Clef: So you're SCP-316?
> 
> 316: I prefer to be called Dyne the Unfettered.
> 
> Clef: Dyne, huh? That short for anything?
> 
> 316: No, just Dyne.
> 
> Clef: Cool. Well, I've been going over your file, and I have a few questions to ask you.
> 
> 316: Please go ahead.
> 
> [DATA EXPUNGED]
> 
> Clef: <laughter> Ain't that the truth. Anyway, this looks good. Looks like we won't have any problems.
> 
> 316: Thank you very much doctor.
> 
> Clef: Call me up sometime, I'll buy you a beer.

**Post-Incident Interview 316-Clef**

> Interviewer: When was it that you realized SCP-316's true nature?
> 
> Clef: It was when I was doing my rounds. I noticed that. . .
> 
> Interviewer: One moment. For the sake of posterity, please clarify what you mean by "your rounds."
> 
> Clef: Oh, right. Well, after the [[[SCP-531-D]]] incident, I was asked to take over evaluation of the other humanoid SCPs. I guess with my experience, the bosses figured I had a good nose for sniffing out humanoid Scips that needed to die. . . anyway, I figured that 316 was your average superhuman, when I realized something weird, walking out of that first interview.
> 
> Interviewer: And what was that?
> 
> Clef: I liked him.
> 
> Interviewer: Is that strange? SCP-316 is. . . was. . . a likeable guy.
> 
> Clef: I don't like ANYONE at first. Especially not Scips. Anyway, that raised my suspicions, so I studied his file a bit closer, and noticed something strange. He'd had favorable contacts with every problematic human SCP on file, from Able to Saint, all positive. . . even Able for crying out loud, and that sociopath REALLY doesn't like anyone.
> 
> Interviewer: It was then that you determined that you had been compromised.
> 
> Clef: Yes. But I needed proof too. I wasn't going to make the same mistake I did with [[[SCP-239]]]. So I decided to make a small test.
> 
> Interviewer: You mean the fencing match?
> 
> Clef: I mean the fencing match.

> Kondraki: Hey, Clef, what's up?
>
> Clef: Not much, Konny. How did the fencing match go.
> 
> Kondraki: Great! He kicked my fucking ass, but it was all good. I got one touch on him, that's all that counts.
> 
> Clef: Really. And Whaddya think about Dyne?
> 
> Kondraki: Awesome guy. We're gonna go again next week. Why the questions?
> 
> Clef: Just curious. Hey, I had a question for you about this year's personnel evaluations.
> 
> Kondraki: Sure

**Post-Incident Interview 316-Clef**

> [BACK]
> 
> 
> Interviewer: And the significance of this was?
> 
> Clef: You know I fence too, right? Saber and Foil. I don't fence with Kondraki, though, because the last time I did, I beat him by one touch in a 15 point match. He took off his mask and threw it against the wall, and insisted on an immediate rematch. Draki's a really sore loser, and he'd just smilingly accepted a loss from a complete stranger. 
> 
> Interviewer: That was when you decided to terminate SCP-316?
> 
> Clef: That was when. But I couldn't make the same mistakes I did with 239. I needed to do this subtly. . . not break in willy nilly and botch the job. That's why I recruited a bunch of relative unknowns instead of going to established and respected SCP Foundation personnel.
