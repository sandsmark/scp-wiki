**Item #:** SCP-262
 
**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:**  
Currently, SCP-262 is undergoing review and research to see if it is capable of being used by field agents in the acquisition of other SCP's.  Monitored use by commander level authority is preferable.  It is unadvised to allow agents unsupervised usage of SCP-262 at this time.

 
**Description:**
SCP-262 is a light brown, European military style greatcoat from a period between the late 1500s to the early 1900's.  It is without any specific designations or markings leading researchers to believe it was an original archetype sample, intended to be submitted to military officials for approval as part of a new uniform design.  The pattern was either rejected or lost because it was never implemented.  It is made of wool and extends below the knee on most individuals.  Carbon dating of the coat fibers have been in conclusive, placing the age of SCP-262 in the range of 6,200 to 6,400 years old.  One explanation is that the wool used to create SCP-262 is perhaps thousands of years old, but the coat itself was cut, sewn and assembled recently.
 
SCP-262 is capable of manifesting numerous arms from within the dark inner lining.  When worn, any subject wearing SCP-262 needs only to open the coat to materialize hands and arms which are somewhat under the subjects control.  Most limbs are human in nature and vary in skin tones, length and strength.  A noted few include: 
* A reptilian-like scaled tentacle some 4m (12 ft) long
* 4 semi-transparent arm-like appendages made of cellulose; over 10m (30 ft) long; 4 fingers; 2 elbow-like joints, no  wrists
* The clawed paw of a large cat; possibly a cougar or mountain lion
* Several feet and legs that appear randomly.
 
The space under SCP-262 is considered to be non-Euclidean in nature and the coat itself divergent of normal dimensions.  In one instance, test subject 402M was told to put SCP-262 over his head.  Upon doing so, SCP-262 fell to the ground as the Class D personnel disappeared under it.  Some time later, finger printing of objects that have come into contact with the limbs of SCP-262 have identified one of the arms as that of subject 402M.
 
Subjects properly wearing SCP-262 are able to manipulate these arms with a varying amount of control.  Test subject 301F was able to perform multiple tasks at once even though she was unware and blindfolded, leading researchers to believe that SCP-262 has both perception and awareness of its surrounding even when the subject does not.  Some even believe SCP-262 to be fully sentient due to some evidence.  This has included SCP-262 
* playing a piano with two or more hands, though the test subject has had no formal training in music
* defending itself/subject from multiple attackers
* several limbs "fighting" one another or even going against the subject's will
 * At times, when a subject attempts to smoke, a particular limb will remove the cigarette from the subject's mouth and then throw it away.  At other times, a different hand will place a cigarette into the subjects mouth and light it though the subject dislikes smoking.
 
**Acquisition:** SCP-262 came into the Foundation's care when 'The Administrator' relinquished his ownership of the coat in the late 20th century.  Because of his status, 'The Administrator' is granted special rights which effectively allow him to remain silent about the origins of SCP-262, how he came to posses it and how he has used it in the past.  'The Administrator' released SCP-262 to the Foundation stating "In the right hands, it could be extremely useful.  In the wrong hands, it could be extremely dangerous.  In my hands, it was becoming extremely dusty and moth ridden and taking up far too much space in my closet."
