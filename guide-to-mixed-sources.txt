+ The Toasty Guide to Mixed Sources

= **Note: This advice is very general and is not meant as legal advice; it is intended solely as a guideline for using mixed-asset works on the SCP Wiki.**

= This is a supplement to the [http://www.scp-wiki.net/guia-licencias-de-archivos Dummy's Guide to licenses] and [http://www.scp-wiki.net/licensing-guide Licensing Guide]. If you still have questions, please contact the Licensing Team directly at SCPLicensing@gmail.com or visit #Site34 on IRC.

Hi, I'm [[*user CityToast]], Junior Licensing Team staffer and general licensing guru. As a freelance graphic artist and writer, I know a decent amount about Creative Commons licensing, and I'm often called to use assets that could have different licenses. This guide is meant to help you create compatible original works by explaining some advanced mixed media concepts.

[[collapsible show="+ A quick review on free licenses versus non-free licenses" hide="- A quick review on free licenses versus non-free licenses"]]

(Remember: just because it's a "Free License" Doesn't mean you can use it on SCP. It must //also// be CC-BY-SA 3.0-compatible.)

**Free Licenses Compatible with CC-BY-SA 3.0** (ONLY these)
* Public Domain and Public Domain Equivalent
* CC-BY
* CC-BY-SA 2.0 or higher
**Free Licenses incompatible with CC-BY-SA 3.0** (Not an exhaustive list)
* Open Data Commons Open Database License (ODbL)
* the MIT License
* Free Art License (FAL).
**Non-Free Licenses** (Not an exhaustive list)
* All Rights Reserved
* Proprietary software
* Pixabay License
* CC-BY-NC
* CC-BY-NC-SA
* CC-BY-ND
* Open Content License (OCL)

> **Protip:** Remember that having a license to something is different from "owning" it. Creative Commons licenses grant //usage rights//, but they do not grant //ownership//, even if you have the right to own a derivative work.

++ What the heck is a mixed-source image?

A mixed source image/graphic/asset is when you take two different assets and merge them together into one derivative asset. Here's an example:

[[collapsible show="Click here to lose sleep tonight" hide="You cannot unsee him and AND HE CANNOT UNSEE YOU"]]
[[image WHATTHEFUCKBALLS.PNG]]
[[/collapsible]]

When you create a work out of assets from different sources, you've created a "Mixed source" work. Since the SCP Wiki is pretty clear about [http://www.scp-wiki.net/image-use-policy what images it does and doesn't allow], it leaves few possible "combinations" that might arise, so I'm going to try and cover the majority of situations that might come up. Now it's time to play:

+ LICENSE ME THIS!

Do you have an asset you'd like to potentially use? Check out this handy dandy table. Remember, this table is a **general guide** and cannot possibly cover all possible scenarios. If there's any questions, ask the Licensing team, would ya?

The asset is...

When you do this, you are licensing it to SCP under CC-BY-SA 3.0, which means other people can now use it as long as they follow those license terms.

Double-check that the other license is **non-exclusive** and doesn't otherwise prohibit it from being multilicensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0, or the other licensee might want to have unhappy conversations.

> Golden Rule #1: So long as the resulting work is compatible with CC-BY-SA 3.0, you can add it to SCP. Doing so releases your art/image under SCP Wiki's CC-BY-SA 3.0 license //regardless of the previous license//. This doesn't invalidate the previous license, though.

+++ Mixing Free Licenses

So you're wanting to create a work for use with SCP! That's great. Make sure to consider the assets you're using.

> Protip: You cannot create derivative works that use CC 3.0 assets mixed with assets under another non-CC free license. For example, you cannot create a derivative work that uses both Creative Commons 3.0 and the Free Art License (FAL) unless the FAL work is multi-licensed under a CC 3.0-compatible license as well.

We're going to use [https://www.publicdomainpictures.net/en/view-image.php?image=308642 this Public Domain image], [https://www.flickr.com/photos/75579135@N00/11277280603 this CC-BY image], and [http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/local--files/collab:citytoast/QtPl5uf.jpg this CC-BY-SA image]. (This is gonna be a weird lookin' skip.)

> Golden Rule #2: When you mix sources, the **minimum** license of the resulting image is the **most restrictive license.**
