**Item #:** SCP-4686

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:**  Foundation web crawlers are to monitor SCP-4686 and prevent civilian access to the website. Information regarding SCP-4686 outside the Foundation is to be immediately acquired and removed. Civilians who have accessed SCP-4686 are to be amnesticised.
 

**Description:** SCP-4686 is a website under the domain name “www.hugs4everyone.i1l4y3”.

The website, thematically colored in various alternating shades of blue and pink, has three input fields: one requesting the "User's Full Name", another requesting a "Type of Hug", and the other requesting the "User's Response", respectively, alongside a "Request Hug" button.

After a person (the requestor) fills in the first two input fields accordingly, clicking the “Request Hug” button will cause an entity, referred to as SCP-4686-1, to emerge and grow from the monitor of the requestor’s device. SCP-4686-1 will then proceed to embrace the requestor based on the type of “hug” requested. 

SCP-4686-1 is capable of manipulating its anatomy and is consistently observed to be covered in fur, closely resembling that of a rabbit or a dog, specifically an Angora rabbit or a Samoyed dog. SCP-4686-1 will continue embracing the requestor for varying amounts of time. At the end of the activity, SCP-4686-1 will wave one of its limbs before reintegrating its mass into the initial computer display. The website will then enter a refractory period lasting from 24 to 145 hours where it will be unavailable to take in requests.

Any attempt to apprehend SCP-4686-1 has failed, as it is capable of becoming incorporeal. The entity also affects any recording devices pointing at itself, distorting or corrupting any data that contains footage of itself within these devices. The operator and creator of SCP-4686 remain unknown.

**Addendum 4686:** Foundation personnel have successfully accessed SCP-4686’s history of operations. Transcribed below is the recent months’ history in table form for ease of view. For the complete list, refer to SCP-4686 Requestor List.
