**Item #:** SCP-4686

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:**  Foundation webcrawlers are to monitor SCP-4686 and prevent civilian access to the website. Information regarding SCP-4686 outside the Foundation is to be immediately removed and acquired. Civilians who have accessed SCP-4686 are to be amnesticed.
 

**Description:** SCP-4686 is a website under the domain name “www.hugs4everyone”.

The website, thematically colored in various alternating shades of blue and pink, has three fields: one requesting the "User's Full Name", another requesting a "Type of Hug", and the other requesting the "User's Response", respectively, alongside a "Request Hug" button.

When a person (the "requestor") fills the first two fields accordingly and clicks the “Request Hug” button, an entity referred to as SCP-4686-1 will emerge and grow from the monitor of the "requestor’s" device and proceed to embrace said "requestor". If the type of "hug" is filled in, the entity will proceed to perform said type of "hug". If left blank it will automatically be filled with “DEFAULT” and SCP-XXXX-1 will proceed to embrace the "requestor".

SCP-4686-1 is capable of manipulating its anatomy and is consistently observed to be covered in fur, closely resembling that of a rabbit or a dog, specifically, an Angora rabbit, or a Samoyed dog. SCP-4686-1 will continue embracing the "requestor" for varying amounts of time. At the end of the activity, SCP-4686 will wave one of its limbs before reintegrating its mass into the initial computer display. The website will then enter a refractory period lasting from 24 to 145 hours where it will be unavailable to take in requests.

Any attempt to apprehend the entity has failed as the entity is capable of becoming incorporeal. The entity also affects any recording devices pointing at itself, within an unknown area around itself, distorting or corrupting any data within these devices. The operator and creator of SCP-4686 remain unknown.

**Addendum 4686:** Foundation personnel have successfully accessed SCP-4686’s history of operations. Transcribed below is the recent months’ history transcribed in table form for ease of view. For the complete list, refer to SCP-4686 Requestor List.
