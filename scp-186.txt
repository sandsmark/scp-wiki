**Item #:** SCP-186

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-186 is to be kept in a room in total darkness (zero candelas). Therefore, the only entry to SCP-186's containment chamber is through a two-stage blast door, which will only open on detection of absolute darkness by photographic sensors. Examination is to only be undertaken via physical touch and MRI, as SCP-186 has been found to remain dormant when investigated thusly. For further information on safe handling procedures for SCP-186, please refer to document #186-a.

**Description:** SCP-186 appears to be a prism 30 cm (12 in) long and 8 cm (3 in) in height. Each rectangular side bears a single line of indecipherable script. SCP-186 has been found to 'crave light', using an as-yet unidentified method of propulsion to reach a light source and destroy it. 

Given the findings of Autopsy Log #186-C, SCP-186 is to be considered highly dangerous as no form of matter has been found to contain it. No consensus has yet formed about whether SCP-186 is sentient; however, its relentless pursuit of a single task has more in common with programming than free thought.

SCP-186 was discovered in ███████ during a routine investigation by a four-man geophysicist team on date: [DATA EXPUNGED]. The nearby village [DATA EXPUNGED] was removed due to possible data leakage during the containment of SCP-186. Mobile station MON-186 was constructed after risk assessment of transport to a permanent site. Radio record of the geophysicists' discovery can be accessed by Level 2 personnel under Audio Log #186-B.  


**Document #186-A:** Additional Handling Information for SCP-186

Dr. ██████: The following is a record of additional observations and recommendations. SCP-186 is unaffected by any form of EM radiation except visible light itself. This is either evidence of some sort of intelligence or a property inherent in SCP-186 that belies its purpose. Physical, mental, and other forms of interaction are also deemed 'safe' provided no light is present. Further investigations are pending. However as a personal note, all personnel are reminded that personal effects that can emit light are prohibited in SCP-186's chamber, especially watches, given [DATA EXPUNGED] unfortunate incident with a Casio 'Auto E.L.' tilt watch.

**Autopsy Log #186-C:** Autopsy of 'Scientist Two'

**<Begin Log>** 
> Perfectly triangular column of matter missing beginning at head lamp and ending at back of skull. No matter recovered from scene. Internal injuries consistent with extreme high-temperature vaporisation. 'Flash' mark found on forehead, consistent with internal burns. Conclude that light and heat of an extreme degree were released just prior to contact. No other injuries found. Cause of death: destruction of brain matter, entry and exit wound in head.
**<End Log>**

**Addendum:**
Strange markings appear on the inside of the wound, not consistent with the markings on SCP-186 itself. Markings appear to form the word '███' when extrapolated to a flat plane. Further research deemed necessary.
