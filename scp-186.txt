**Item #:** SCP-186

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:**

 SCP-186 is to be kept in a room in total darkness (Zero Candelas). To this end, entry to SCP-186's containment chamber is only to be accessed through a two stage blast door, the door to SCP-186's chamber only opening on detection of absolute darkness by photographic sensors. Examination is to only be undertaken via physical touch and MRI, as SCP-186 has been found to remain dormant when investigated thusly. For further information on safe handling procedures for SCP-186, please refer to document #186-a.

**Description:**

SCP-186 was discovered in ███████ during a routine investigation by a four man geophysicist team on date: [EXPUNGED]. The nearby village [EXPUNGED] was removed due to possible data leakage during the containment of SCP-186. Mobile station MON-186 was constructed after risk assessment of transport to a permanent site. Radio record of the geophysicists' discovery can be accessed by LEVEL TWO personnel under audio log #186-b.  

Using the above methods to image SCP-186, it has been discovered that SCP-186 takes the form of a prism around 0.3m (1ft) in length and 7.6cm (3in) in height, each rectangular side bearing a single line of indecipherable script.

SCP-186 has been found to 'crave light', using an as yet unidentified method of propulsion to reach a light source and destroy it. Given the findings of autopsy log #186-c, SCP-186 is to be considered highly dangerous as no form of matter has been found to contain it. It is as of yet undecided if SCP-186 bears any form of sentience, however, its relentless pursuit of a single task has more in common with programming than free thought.


**Document #186-a:** SCP-186 Additional Handling Information

Dr. ██████: The following is a record of additional observations and recommendations. SCP-186 is unaffected by any form of EM radiation bar light itself, this is either evidence of some sort of intelligence or a property inherent in SCP-186 that belies its purpose. Physical, mental, and other forms of interaction are also deemed 'safe' provided no light is present. Further investigations are pending, however as a personal note, all personnel are reminded that personal effects that can emit light are prohibited in SCP-186's chamber, especially watches, given Agent [EXPUNGED]'s unfortunate incident with a Casio 'Auto E.L.' tilt watch.

**Autopsy Log #186-c:** Autopsy of 'Scientist Two'

**<Begin Log>** 
> Perfect prism of matter missing beginning at head lamp and ending back of skull.
> No matter recovered from scene, internal injuries consistent with extreme high temperature vaporisation.
> 'Flash' mark found on forehead, consistent with internal burns, indicate that a light and heat of an extreme degree was released just prior to contact.
> No other injuries found, cause of death, destruction of brain matter, entry and exit wound in head.
**<End Log>**

**Addendum:**
Strange markings appear on the inside of the wound, not consistent with the markings on the prism itself, appear to form the word '███' when extrapolated to a flat plane. Further research deemed necessary.
