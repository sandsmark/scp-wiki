**Item #:** SCP-186

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-186 is contained in a double-walled chamber that must be kept in complete darkness. Entry to SCP-186's chamber is possible only via a single two-stage blast door, which will only open on detection of absolute darkness by photographic sensors. No light-emitting devices are allowed within the inner chamber.

Examination of SCP-186 may only be performed with prior permission from at least two (2) Level 3 personnel, and may only take the form of somatosensory observation or MRI scanning.

Note: As of the findings detailed in Addendum 186-01 (see below), infrared and ultraviolet imaging and analysis of SCP-186 are tentatively approved, pending a method can be devised of doing so with zero visible light emission.

**Description:** SCP-186 appears to be a triangular bi-pyramidal object of unknown composition approximately 30 cm long and 8 cm in width, which bears a single line of indecipherable script on each face. SCP-186 has an unexplained ability to sense and destroy sources of light, and can propel itself at extremely high velocities to reach its target. SCP-186 is to be considered highly dangerous as no containment method or material has been found to reliably contain it in an active state (exposed to light). No consensus has yet formed about whether SCP-186 is sentient; however, its relentless pursuit of a single task is more consistent with programmed behavior than free thought.

SCP-186 was discovered in [REDACTED] during a routine investigation by a four-man geophysicist team on ██/█/████. The nearby village of [REDACTED] was removed to prevent any possible leak of information regarding the containment of SCP-186.

**Addendum 186-01:** Additional Handling Information for SCP-186

> After extensive experimentation, SCP-186 has been found to only be affected by electromagnetic radiation in the visible light range. This is either evidence of some sort of intelligence or a property inherent in SCP-186 that belies its purpose. Further testing is pending, but so far it has not responded to any other form of manipulation, and is in fact safe to handle in any way so long as no visible light is present.
>
> As a reminder, however, personnel are reminded that no objects capable of emitting light are allowed in its chamber at any time, as we do not want another incident like the one that occurred with Dr. ███████ and his self-illuminating wristwatch.

**Addendum 186-03:** Autopsy Report of █████ ████████ (Designation GPT-Two)

> There is a perfectly triangular column of matter missing beginning at the head lamp and ending at the back of the skull, of which none was recovered from the scene. Internal injuries are consistent with extreme high-temperature vaporization, and a 'flash mark' was found on forehead, also consistent with internal burns.
> Some strange markings were noted, seared into the inside of the wound. These are not consistent with the markings on SCP-186 itself, and appear to form the word '███' when extrapolated to a flat plane. Further research deemed necessary.
> 
> Conclusion: A bright light and heat of an extreme degree were released just prior to contact. No other injuries found.
> 
> Cause of Death: Instantaneous and high-temperature destruction of brain tissue, with entry and exit wounds as noted.
