**Item #:** SCP-2000

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Site ██ was built above SCP-2000, and is located in Antarctica at the Earth's Southern Pole. SCP-2000 is publicly concealed as the IceCube Neutrino Observatory; a cover-up organization has been established through the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

**Addendum-2000-1:** Foundation cover-up of Event 2000-Omega is ongoing. Efforts are underway to retroactively alter astronomical maps, to administer appropriate amnesiacs as necessary, and to monitor and subdue the publishing of any material regarding the effects of Event 2000-Omega. 

Site ██ is to remain operational indefinitely with standard maintenance and guard staff to maintain the integrity and secrecy of SCP-2000 components. 

**Description:** SCP-2000 is a large subterranean complex, believed extraterrestrial in origin. SCP-2000 extends approximately 7,390m below ground with 2,718 levels, and has an approximate floor area of 738,905,600 sq meters. Geological analysis of the surrounding rock indicates that SCP-2000 was constructed 1.253 billion years ago (__+__ 0.002 BY) in its current position. Small-scale fissures indicate that the Antarctic Tectonic plate has been partially fractured as a result of sliding around SCP-2000.

[[/div]] 

Research in 196█ confirmed that SCP-2000 perpetually broadcasts a dense stream of neutrinos toward the center of the Earth, which is then redirected at Earth's core through unknown means. Regardless of Earth's relative position and orientation, this beam maintains focus toward a fixed coordinate point located within the Center Bulge of the Milky Way Galaxy.

SCP-2000 has been fully mapped, with three primary features designated SCP-2000-1 through -3. 2000-1 is an area comprising parts of floors 25 through 29 and contains a concentration of display readouts and input controls. Conduits throughout the entire complex join at junction relays and all eventually terminate at 2000-1, indicating that it is the control center for the entire complex. --Displays in 2000-1 are alert and active, and appear to perpetually display real time information using a combination of graphics and an undecipherable alien language. This information is largely meaningless without knowledge of the systems or the language. An attempt is underway to interact with 2000-1 in an effort to learn more.-- (See Document 2000-114) Displays in 2000-1 are dead and unresponsive. 

2000-2 is an area comprising parts of the lowest 271 levels, and is the source of the neutrino transmission beam. It is believed to hold an immense focusing mechanism which directs neutrinos produced by 2000-3 into a beam 271m in diameter, with an average neutrino density of 27 quadrillion neutrinos per sq cm. 

2000-3 is a perfectly spherical section comprising the central sections of levels 1223-1495. There are several hundred shuttered transparent viewing apertures located along the equatorial belt of 2000-3. When unshuttered, these apertures allow limited filtered wavelengths of visible light to pass through. Visual indications show that 2000-3 houses what appears to be a miniature neutron star, designated 2000-4. 2000-4 is an estimated 400m in diameter with a rotational period of 0.5 ms. Gravimetric and electromagnetic readings do not pick up any usual activity near the vicinity of 2000-4; either 2000-4 does not produce gravitational and electromagnetic fields, or 2000-3 effectively blocks them.

In addition to the primary faculties, SCP-2000 also houses a small section believed to be abandoned alien living quarters, several large cavernous rooms of unknown purpose, and approximately 2.71 billion meters of conduit connecting 2000-1, 2000-2, and 2000-3.

**Document 2000-114: Partial transcript of Video Log 2000-Epsilon**


**Foreword:** On 10/07/196█, after █ years of study, the first attempt was made to interact with SCP-2000-1 control consoles. 54 researchers are present, as well as Site Director F███████. 27 researchers are seated in front of control stations, while head researcher Dr. P████ gives instructions. Displays are active.

> 00:00:01 - //Dr. P█████ is talking to various aides.//
> 
> 00:00:12 - **Dr. P█████:** Alright, let us begin. Station Theta, hit control eight dash one two, just like we rehearsed. 
> 
> 00:00:19 - //No obvious visual changes appear on any displays.//
> 
> 00:00:34 - **Dr. P█████:** Very well. Station Lambda, please turn dial one dash twelve counterclockwise by ten degrees. Okay, twenty degrees. Thirty. Fourty.
> 
> 00:00:46 - **Lambda Controller:** Uhm, I can't turn it anymore. That's as far as it goes. 
> 
> 00:00:52 - **Dr. P█████:** Hmmmm. Nothing. Very well. Station Lambda, please return the dial to its original position.
> 
> 00:01:12 - //Dr. P█████ consults his notes.//
> 
> 00:01:46 - **Dr. P█████:** Alright, let us begin again. Station Mu, try hitting button three dash one. Yes, the big one.

**Frame By Frame Analysis:** Below is a frame-by-frame analysis of Video Log 2000-Epsilon at approximately 04:26:00. Video was captured at 30 frames per minute, with frames approximately every 33 milliseconds.

> 04:26:00:00 - Dr. P█████ is standing behind Zeta Controller. No abnormal activity present. 
> 
> 04:26:00:033 - Two unknown entities now exist in the middle of the room. Resolution is low but entities appear to be floating sycamore-seed shaped distortions. There are several spotlights illuminating them, but they still appear perfectly black on camera and cast large shadows, longer and more distorted than their shape would suggest.
> 
> 04:26:00:066 - The entities are now in front of separate display panels. The entities appear to have opened previously unknown access hatches and are interacting with the interior hardware. Researchers begin to fall limp.
> 
> 04:26:00:100 - An assortment of hardware is floating in the middle of the room where the entities first appeared. Hardware is believed to have originated from within the console interiors. Site Director F███████ is floating in a vaguely fetal position near the hardware.
> 
> 04:26:00:133 - The entities and the hardware have vanished, and all display panels are shut. No further anomalous activity is recorded. 

**Final Note:** After event 2000-Epsilon, all displays appear dead. Further attempts to interact with displays have proved fruitless. No further sightings or evidence of the anomalous entities or Site Director F███████ have been reported.

[[/div]]
> On 12/04/1994, the O5 council issued a top priority order to Site ██, directing senior personnel to focus all efforts on interrupting the stream of neutrinos emanating from SCP-2000. Since neutrinos pass through all solid matter, extreme measures were necessary to interrupt the beam. On 17/10/1996, Site Director L███ made a formal request to the O5 council asking permission to use SCP-████. The request detailed a plan to create a spatial anomaly which would redirect the Neutrino stream away from Milky Way Galaxy, toward galaxy 3C 252, which lies near the edge of known space. Two months later, the O5 council approved the request. On 19/05/1999, SCP-████ was activated within SCP-2000, creating a bend in spacetime to redirect the Neutrino stream. Immediately the Neutrino stream ceased.  The neutron star within 2000-1, being closely monitored, slowed from a rotational period of 0.5 ms to 500 ms. It is now believed that there was two-way communication between SCP-2000 and the terminal point in the Galactic Central, and that the spatial anomaly interrupted this communication. At the exact moment of interruption, reports began coming in from civilian and Foundation observatories all over the world. 226 supernovae were observed to erupt throughout the Milky Way, 34 new black holes were discovered, and 11 previously documented stars disappeared with no trace. Most activity was centered in and around the Center Bulge of the Milky Way Galaxy; none of the activity posed any threat to Earth. 
> 
> Efforts to reinstate the Neutrino stream have been unsuccessful. 
> 
> Requests by Site Director L███ to reclassify Event Omega-2000 as an XK-Scenario and utilize reality altering SCPs to retroactively prevent Event Omega-2000 have been denied.
