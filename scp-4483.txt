**Item #:** SCP-4483

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4483 is to be held in a standard secure containment locker at Site-19.  Following Incident 4483.1, all personnel using SCP-4483 for testing must have shown significant ability for concept cognition, visualization, and retainment.  Use of SCP-4483 on human subjects, whether for testing purposes or otherwise, has been indefinitely suspended.

Due to their variable morphology, all instances of SCP-4483-1 are to be held in organic containment facilities appropriate for their size.

**Description:** SCP-4483 is a single-bladed steel sword 91.4 cm in length and weighing 981 grams.  The sword bears gold inlay script along the dull edge of its blade, and has been identified as a falchion of Italian design dating from either the late 15th or early 16th century AD.

When SCP-4483 is used to sever a piece of a living organism, the piece that is viewed by the wielder as being "cut off" will show an immediate cessation of all life signs, while the other piece, regardless of biological ability to do so, will become independently animate and capable of thought, retaining the consciousness and personality of the organism that it was severed from.  Any organism affected by the anomalous properties of SCP-4483 is classified as an instance of SCP-4483-1.

Instances of SCP-4483-1 show no reliance on bodily functions governed by organs they do not possess: this is demonstrated by their ability to survive without blood if lacking a heart or circulatory system, or to engage in cognitive tasks despite lacking a brain.  Instances are incapable of performing physical actions beyond the capacity of their anatomy.  Instances can be killed by any injury to or disruption of their primary retained organs and/or bodily systems that would normally render them inoperable.

SCP-4483 was recovered on 9/7/2018 from the house of Tony Brooks in ███████, ██, United States following his arrest on 17 charges of kidnapping and murder.  The item's anomalous properties were discovered after local law enforcement discovered a wooden crate containing fourteen (14) live instances of SCP-4483-1 during a search of the suspect's home.  All recovered instances were human hands from females between the ages of five and twenty-one.  An additional three (3) instances of SCP-4483-1, all deceased, were discovered buried behind the suspect's house.

The apparent sapience of SCP-4483-1 instances was discovered after the recovery team found several messages scratched into the interior of the wooden crate used by the suspect to contain the 14 living instances.  The inscriptions appeared to have been made using human fingernails.  A transcript of these messages can be found in Addendum 4483.3.

**Addendum 4483.1: Testing Log**
[[collapsible show="+ Show Testing Log" hide="- Hide"]]
__**Test 4483-1 - 9/14/2018**__
> **Subject:** D-13225 (Male, 38).  Subject has been comatose since an encounter with SCP-████.
> **Procedure:** Subject's right hand is severed at the wrist using SCP-4483, cutting through the radius and ulna directly above the attachment to the carpal bones.
> **Results:** Once bleeding was stopped, no visible change was observed in subject's condition.  Upon examination, subject's severed hand exhibited no signs of independent animation.
> **Analysis:** //Curious.  I wonder how the existing instances of -1 were created?  Maybe the subject's condition affected the outcome.  I'll requisition a healthy subject and we'll try again.  Maybe try a different bodypart this time? - Dr. Campbell//

__**Test 4483-2 - 9/27/2018**__
> **Subject:** D-19021 (Male, 51).  Subject is facing termination after killing one staff member and seriously injuring another.
> **Procedure:** Subject is decapitated with SCP-4483, severing the spinal column between the C3 and C4 cervical vertebrae. 
> **Results:** Subject's body remains animate following decapitation.  EEG readings show an immediate cessation of electrical impulses in the subjects brain, occurring with significantly greater rapidity than during standard decapitations.  Bleeding from the neck is stopped, and subject is moved to containment.
> **Analysis:** //It seems we may have stumbled on the key to this SCP purely by accident - it appears to react to how the wielder conceives the incision they are making.  In this case, Researcher ████████ appears to have viewed the head as the piece they were removing, due to a certain linguistic oddity of the English language related to decapitation. - Dr. Campbell//

__**Test 4483-3 - 10/11/2018**__
> **Subject:** D-19675 (Male, 62).  Subject has been diagnosed with terminal Stage IV pancreatic cancer.  Cancer has metastasized to the subject's lymph nodes, liver, large intestine, and lungs.
> **Procedure:** Subject is decapitated with SCP-4483, severing the spinal column between the C6 and C7 cervical vertebrae, with special care taken to avoid the larynx.  The researcher performing the incision is to be instructed to conceptualize that they are "cutting off the body".
> **Results:** Subject's body shows a cessation of life signs consistent with that observed in standard decapitations.  Head displays signs of being independently animate, and after being fitted with an artificial respiratory system is able to communicate normally following a short adjustment period.  Subject is moved to containment for further observation.
> **Analysis:** //It appears my inkling was correct.  The object seems to work based on which piece of the body the wielder views as the "primary" one. - Dr. Campbell//

__**Test 4483-3 - 10/11/2018**__
> **Subject:** One (1) laboratory mouse (//Mus musculus//).
> **Procedure:** SCP-4483 is used to sever the subject's front left leg, cutting through the humerus directly below where it connects to the scapula.The researcher performing the incision is to be instructed to conceptualize that they are "cutting off the body".
> **Results:** Subject's body shows a cessation of life signs, while the severed leg remains animate.  Instance is moved to containment for further observation.
> **Analysis:** //This thing really wasn't designed to cut things this small.  Regardless, we now know it works on animals other than humans.  That should get the site's ethics liaison off my back. - Dr. Campbell//

**Addendum 4483.2: Incident 4483.1**
On █/██/2019, several staff members attempted to use SCP-4483 on Agent ██████ in an emergency medical capacity.  Agent ██████ had been partially disemboweled during a limited containment breach, and an attempt was made remove the damaged organs (primarily parts of the gastrointestinal tract) under the reasoning that SCP-4483's anomalous properties would allow Agent ██████ to survive without them.  However, possibly due to the stress of the situation, the staff member using SCP-4483 appears to have improperly visualized the procedure, and Agent ██████ [DATA EXPUNGED].

**Addendum 4483.3**
Record of inscriptions found alongside recovered SCP-4483-1 instances.  The inscriptions appear to have been made by several different instances of SCP-4483-1.

**Addendum 4483.4**
Routine euthanization of SCP-4483-1 instances which have proven incapable of perception or communication has been requested, and is on hold pending review by the site director.
