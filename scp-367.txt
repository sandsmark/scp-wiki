**Item #:** SCP-XXX
**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:**

SCP-367 containment area is to be checked daily for damage done by SCP-367.  Any and all damage to containment area is to be repaired immediately.  Should damage exceed that which can be repaired in a 12 hour period, SCP-367 is to be moved to a temporary containment area and kept under constant observation while repairs are made.  Any attempts by SCP-367 to damage or escape containment are to immediately be met with Chemical Suppression Tactic A-11 (CST A-11)

SCP-367 is to be provided with one (1) kilogram of “feed” every two hours, which may be comprised of any available bio-matter.  In the event of no suitable bio-mass being available, other items may be provided for consumption and CST A-11 is to be placed on stand by in case of rejection behavior by SCP-367.  SCP-367 is to be weighed after each feeing period to monitor weight and density increase leading up to division.

Additional instances of SCP-367 forming in containment are to be disposed of [DATA EXPUNGED] residue.  No unprotected interaction with SCP-367 is to be undertaken unless it is within thirty (30) minutes of a feeding period.  SCP-367 may not be removed from the containment area without approval by Site Command.  No instances of SCP-367 are to be released to staff for any purpose other than testing.

**Description:**

SCP-367 appears to be a small dog of variable breed, most often appearing as a small, brown puppy.  SCP-367 exhibits normal behavior for a dog of its apparent age and size, but appears slightly more active then normal, exhibits a slightly elevated level of appetite, and does not sleep.

SCP-367 is a massive single-celled organism, comprised of what appears to be a mass of “yellow slime” with several white “threads” suspended in it, with a semi-solid sphere of gray material in the center, deemed the “Nucleus”.  It is unknown what SCP-367 is made of, or why it’s outer “shell” appears to be a juvenile dog, however testing [DATA EXPUNGED] further investigation.  The “strings” appear to function as the muscular-skeletal system and under most circumstances the movement and general function of SCP-367 is indistinguishable from a normal dog.

SCP-367 is capable of feeding on any solid matter, and has show the ability to dissolve and digest concrete, steel, titanium, carbon fiber, bone, wood, [DATA EXPUNGED].  When presented with an item that cannot fit in to the external shell’s mouth, or be broken down with the teeth, SCP-367 will project pseudopodia from its internal mass and begin to break down the matter in to a consumable form.  It is unknown how this occurs, as no acid is used, but it appears to be a disruption of the basic atomic bonds of the matter which is still under investigation.

SCP-367 does not increase in size when consuming items, but does increase in density.  In addition, SCP-367 does not produce any waste.  After consuming enough to double it’s starting mass, SCP-367 will find an isolated location, such as a cabinet or under furniture, and liquefy its outer shell.  It will then divide in to two equal masses, and “re-form” it’s outer shell, creating two instances of SCP-367.

If SCP-367 is without food for over three hours, the internal “strings” will project from the “eyes” and “mouth” areas of SCP-367, and attempt to bore in to and break down all nearby matter.  In this state, SCP-367 is highly aggressive, and has been observed [DATA EXPUNGED]

**Addendum:**

**Notes on recovery:**  SCP-367 was recovered from the residential home of Ms. Myra Bancroft in Ireland.  Mrs. Bancroft was reported missing several days before, and Foundation staff established containment of her residence when it was reported that she had over eighty small dogs in her home, which had consumed her corpse and most of the home.  Single instance of SCP-367 was recovered, with all other instances eliminated via CST A-11.

Ongoing monitoring is in effect to isolate any remaining SCP-367 outside of containment.
