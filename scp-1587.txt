title:SCP-1587
**Item #:** SCP-1587

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1587 is to be stored  within a standard Safe-class storage room at Site 19. Its location will be visibly marked with a red border on the floor. Personnel are reminded not to step into this border while SCP-1587 is in use.
All personnel who have undergone testing with SCP-1587 must undergo complete decontamination before leaving the containment area.  Experimentation with SCP-1587 may only be performed with prior written permission from at least two (2) Level 4 Personnel. 

**Description:** SCP-1587 is a steel bed frame 1.93 meters in length, 3.4 meters in width and 1 meter high. It has been fitted with an ordinary mattress for comfortable use and testing of the object.  Attached underneath the bed frame is a metal box containing an intricate design of complex machinery which has been determined to be the source of SCP-1587’s unusual effects. Attempts to reverse-engineer this technology are ongoing.

SCP-1587’s effects only activate when a live human (hereafter referred to as “the subject”) enters REM sleep while on SCP-1587. At this point, SCP-1587 and the subject will simultaneously demanifest. GPS devices attached onto the subject will be temporarily disabled; however audio, visual and other recording devices retain their functionality.

SCP-1587 transports the subject and itself into an alternate dimension (hereby referred to as SCP-1587-1) which has been confirmed to be what the subject perceives as his/her dream. The subject will then be woken up by a 520 Hz vibration from SCP-1587 and be allowed to travel around in SCP-1587-1. Subjects report having full control of their senses, and can interact with any object physically. The subject will return to the baseline dimension after 6 hours, or can be returned prematurely by entering REM sleep again in SCP-1587-1 or death, which will not harm the subject physically but can leave psychological scars. SCP-1587 will remanifest at its previous location along with the subject and any objects that he was carrying at that time. Any object that impedes the remanifestation of SCP-1587 will be displaced to the sides of SCP-1587 on an atomic level.

Subjects made to dream about real life places will not be transported to the real-world version of that location; they are transported to a version of SCP-1587-1 made to resemble that location. Likewise, people met in SCP-1587-1 will not have any effect whatsoever on their in-universe equivalent, however these encounters may affect the subject on a psychological level. 

**Addendum 1587-A:** SCP-1587 was discovered after reports of a mysterious death in █████, ██████████. The Foundation was contacted by a liaison after local authorities discovered anachronistic elements in the death of Asoc. Professor █████ █████. The deceased was found lying on his bed with multiple bullets in his chest, but without any visible gunshot wounds.  Post-mortem analysis revealed that he had been dead for only 3 days, yet ballistic analysis of the bullets in his chest determined that they were manufactured in the early 1940s and had been fired nearly 60 years before his death. Foundation authorities took over the investigation and had successfully recovered SCP-1587.

**Addendum 1587-B:** The deceased kept a dream diary which was related to his usage of SCP-1587. Notable entries are declassified for viewing.
> Dear Diary,
> 
> Last night, I successfully made myself dream about **candies**. 
> 
> I woke up in a world where roads were liquorice, stones were gobstoppers and it rained gumdrops. The sky was also orange.
> 
> I had to walk about 3 miles from the start zone in order to reach the nearest town.  I remember that the houses were mashed potatoes (this did not fit), the gardens were full of rainbow sprinkles and the pavement was sugar pebbles. I remember an overall color scheme of pink, orange, brown.
> 
> The civilians were sentient cakes with imprinted faces, and I was warmly greeted by the townsfolk and led into a crystal town hall. I had a talk with the leader of the village (they conversed in English, fortunately) and was treated to a feast of chocolate fondue, drinks of hot chocolate and some ice-cream for dessert. I probably got diabetes.
> 
> By this point, 2 and half hours have elapsed. I decided that I should explore further. They loaned me a car carved from a cupcake and I drove through a donut tunnel to another nearby metropolis, which had an overall color scheme of blue and bright yellow.
>  
> The buildings there were constructed of solid sugar crystals, and had significantly more advanced technology than the previous village. Traffic lights were color-changing lollipops and the civilians were what I can only describe as candy golems. There were schools, banks (the currency was apparently chocolate coins), and even a military base which I had been denied access. 
> 
> The 6 hours had elapsed while I was exploring the city and I was brought back safely.
> Inventory included several high-quality gumdrops and a bar of milk chocolate to enjoy.
> 
> Signed,
>  █████


> Dear Diary,
> 
> Last night, I have unsuccessfully made myself dream about **cute animals**.
> 
> I woke up in a rainforest. The trees looked normal, I could identify a few, for example Brachychiton acerifolius, Cerbera manghas, Darlingia darlingiana and Diospyros copulosa. The canopy had blocked the view of the sun, and I was unable to approximate my location. Color scheme was green and brown.
> 
> The animals were sentient, and were all able to converse in English. A majority of the animals should not have been found in a typical rainforest, including the common cat, the common dog, and white rabbits. 
> There was a congregation of these animals about 2 miles from start location. I had been spotted and was requested to help them eliminate a bear that had been terrorising them for years.
> 
> [REDACTED FOR BREVITY]
> 
> It resembled a grizzly bear, but twice the size and with mandibles that resembles those of a spider.  I was not mentally prepared for this beast that I was about to face, and hesitated. It lunged into me and broke my back. I was paralysed from the waist down, but my upper body was still mobile. I thrust two daggers dipped in ████ poison  into its sternum and killed the beast.
> 
> [REDACTED FOR BREVITY]
> 
> Inventory included three carrots, a ruby necklace, three opals and [REDACTED].

> Signed,
>  █████


**Addendum 1587-C:** A letter to the deceased was found in his drawer.

> Hey  █████!
> 
> Wanna watch a movie with us tonight? It's this World War II documentary my wife made, and you know how much she loves friends reviewing her work.
> 
> I've got booze and pizza! Give me a call.
> 
> Best pal,
> █████
