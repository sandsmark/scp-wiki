**Item #:** SCP-1992

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1992 is to be contained in a standard security vault, located in Site-77's Euclid SCP wing. The main entrance to SCP-1992 has been fitted with standard security devices, with access authorized for appropriately ranked personnel. Posted guards are notified that any subjects who are able to breach containment and enter SCP-1992 should not be pursued inside. If the subject does not exit SCP-1992 of their own volition after thirty minutes, one security drone is to enter SCP-1992 to remove and detain the subject as quickly as possible.

**Description:** SCP-1992 is a mobile home located in ██████ ███████, Kentucky. It contains a living room, two bedrooms, a kitchen, a closet, and a spare room. According to available historical records, it was constructed at some point in the 1950's. The building shows wear and damage expected with its age. However, no reports of its anomalous effects are dated earlier then 1972.

If a sapient organism enters SCP-1992, they may cause SCP-1992-1 to manifest. Instances of SCP-1992-1 are simplified humanoids, superficially resembling the subject. If the subject crosses between the different rooms within SCP-1992, causing an instance of SCP-1992-1 to be generated from all other exits from the room,  moving out in a parallel action in which an alternate decision had been made. 

Instances of SCP-1992-1 continually to move through SCP-1992, thus causing additional instances to be generated. As the number of SCP-1992-1 instances increases, the interior of SCP-1992 gains additional space, appearing to generate every possible instance of the building interior. These expansions are identical to pre-existing portions of SCP-1992, however the layout will be altered to have rooms arranged in every possible manner of construction. As SCP-1992 expands, its rooms lose detail with each successive iteration, until the rooms are plain white and almost devoid of furniture. Curiously, no alterations to the bedrooms have been noted. Subjects within SCP-1992 have reported seeing identical copies of themselves engaging in activities identically. --No sapience has been reported by any SCP-1992-1 instance.-- //See Addendum 1992-A//

SCP-1992 was found on 9/18/1995, when agents investigating reports of anomalous activity from ██████ ███████. Upon initial discovery Agent Boyd entered SCP-1992, and reported that he would move towards the kitchen. Moments later, Agent Boyd reported five copies of himself, moving towards the dining room, the living room, a closet, a bathroom, and towards the stairs. After exiting, current containment procedures were enacted. SCP-1992 has been contained as of 1/30/1996, and classified as Euclid.

**Addendum 1992-A:** On 8/20/2002, during testing of SCP-1992's anomalous effect, Researcher Leipzig was able to communicate with an instance of SCP-1992-1. To date, this is the only time an instance has shown signs of sapience.

> **SCP-1992-1:** "We could answer the man. We could remain silent. Yes, we can understand you"
> 
> **Researcher Leipzig:** "What is your purpose?"
> 
> **SCP-1992-1:** "We could answer specific to this one. We could answer non-specifically to all of us. We could ask for clarification as to "purpose." We could remain silent. Define "purpose."
> 
> **Researcher Leipzig:** "What is your reason for being, for existing?"
> 
> **SCP-1992-1:** "We could answer specific to this one. We could answer non-specifically to all of us. We could answer the first half. We could answer the second half. We could answer in full. We could ask for further clarification. We could choose"
