The topic of these videos discuss questions SCP-2089-1 failed to respond to, references to other blogs, and subjects pertaining to SCP-2089's followers.  In 48% of recorded videos, SCP-2089-1 will attempt to commit suicide, with only 11% of those attempts being successful. Following videos indicate no physical harm inflicted onto SCP-2089-1.

Any follower who regularly views content related to SCP-2089-1[[footnote]] Looking at related content consistently (>30 minutes per day) for approximately one week will result in an instance of SCP-2089-2[[/footnote]] becomes an instance of SCP-2089-2. All instances of SCP-2089-2 re-post and create new content related to SCP-2089-1 whenever possible. Instances of SCP-2089-2 are noted to post content indicating a marked prejudice against SCP-2089-1. Some of the content includes:

* Comments expressing dislike towards SCP-2089-1

> **<Begin Log>**
> 
> **Researcher:** Hello, D-90327. I will be interviewing you today.
> 
> **D-90327:** Ok.
> 
> **Researcher:** How do you feel about SCP-2089-1?
> 
> **D-90327:** [shrugs] Don't like him.
> 
> **Researcher:** What is it that you particularly don't like about him?
> 
> **D-90327:** I told you. I don't like him.
> 
> **Researcher:** Ok, fine. Why do you think others might dislike SCP-2089-1?
> 
> **D-90327:** For shits and giggles, mainly.
> 
> **Researcher:** What would you say is the motive behind this hatred?
> 
> **D-90327:** [chuckles] For fun. It's more like a ... well, I guess like a high, right?
> 
> **Head Researcher:** Interesting. Why do you think...
> 
> D-90327 takes out a piece of paper from the back of his pocket. Words are written on the paper. Half of it is written is ink, while the rest appears to be written in blood.
> 
> **D-90327:** Hold that thought, doc. Check out what I made.
> 
> D-90327 hands over the paper. Upon closer inspection, it is a poem titled "Fuck John".
> 
> **Researcher:** Huh. [holds the paper up to the light] Did you write this in blood?
> 
> **D-90327:** Oh, yeah. I didn't have a pen, so I just picked at this scab on my arm. [rolls up sleeve] Can you believe it's been there for three weeks? Anyways, considering how many times I picked at this thing, it probably took me three days to make that. I think I can even post it online. What do you think?
> 
> D-90327 glares at the researcher. A smile slowly spreads across his face.
> 
> **Researcher:** Uhh ... I'll think about it.
> 
> **<End Log>**
> 
> **Conclusion:** The paper was confiscated from D-90327 after the interview. Approval to test if the paper exhibits the same effects of other SCP-2089-1 related content is currently pending.

**Recovery Log:** On 09/26/20██, Foundation Agents used the address obtained from SCP-2089-I-1026 in an attempt to locate SCP-2089-1. Personnel arrived at Bitch Mountain, located in Chesterfield, New York. To date, SCP-2089-1 has not been found.

Personnel recovered several items surrounding the area. Among these items included:

* A hooded jacket similar to the one worn by SCP-2089-1
* Knives, needles and other sharp objects coated in blood. DNA analysis proves that it is from a Caucasian male, estimated to be 18-20 years old.
* An unfinished painting of a male figure. Inscribed in blood are the words "Never die". DNA analysis confirms that it does not match with the blood found on other objects.

//Note from Agent Thompson: To this day, It still baffles me that we were given a concrete address. Our GPS satellites confirmed that the address is in fact, a two story house like the user "MrBRASIL" stated. As we drove there the surroundings began to shift from an interstate highway to a dirt road lined with trees. No one even noticed it. When we arrived at Bitch Mountain, is was disheartening.//

//We received news that the Foundation sent a Mobile Task Force to the same address. A small team was dispatched on a helicopter. However, the same thing happened to them. An Agent reported seeing the landscape change from dense woods to rocky mountains right before her very eyes. To this day, we don't know why this occurs.//

//We may be dealing with a fad. But it is clear that whoever is behind it doesn't want anyone to interfere.//

**Addendum 2089-03:** The following is an excerpt of a recorded video posted by an instance of SCP-2089-2.

[[collapsible show="+ Video excerpt" hide="+ Close"]]

SCP-2089-1 is seen facing the camera inside a dimly lit room. SCP-2089-1 then diverts its attention away from the screen. Note that SCP-2089-1 is wearing a mask in place of its traditional hooded jacket. An unidentified male voice speaks:

> You know what to do?

SCP-2089 -1 nods. It faces the camera again.

> Hey everyone. It's John here. By popular request, I will be performing a bit of ... fan service, if you will. [pause] Do I have to?

> Yes.

> Alright, give me.

SCP-2089-1 receives a piece of wire tied into the shape of a noose. SCP-2089-1 then walks towards the ceiling fan located the center of the room. A chair is below the fan, allowing SCP-2089-1 to climb up and attach the noose to the fan. SCP-2089-1 then places its head inside the noose. SCP-2089-1 kicks the chair beneath it, allowing itself to hang.

SCP-2089-1 is heard gagging and gasping for several seconds. The fan holding the noose breaks, and SCP-2089-1 falls to the floor with the fan on top of it. A male figure is seen approaching SCP-2089-1.

> Yep. That'll do.

The figure tosses the fan to the side to look at SCP-2089-1. Closer observation indicates several cuts on the neck of SCP-2089-1, presumably from the wire. SCP-2089-1 continues to gag, coughing up blood as it speaks.

> I ... I did it.

The unidentified male turns SCP-2089-1's head over, revealing a fracture in its skull.

> Wow. A clean break. I'm saving this.

The figure pulls out a mobile device and takes a picture of SCP-2089-1.

> [cough] Are you pleased?

> Yes. Very.

> Then I'm [cough] p-p-pleased.

The figure picks up SCP-2089-1 and places it into a chair. The figure then pushes the chair towards the camera so that the viewer can get a closer image of SCP-2089-1.

> This is John. Say hi, John.

> Hi. [cough]

SCP-2089-1 coughs up blood. A splatter stains the upper left corner of the screen.

> John is an entertainer. You followers expect torture, rape, castration, suicide. And John gives you exactly that. Isn't that right, John?

SCP-2089-1 nods. The figure spins the chair around to reveal the back of SCP-2089-1's head. The camera zooms in on SCP-2089-1's skull fracture.

> We keep John alive. Because he is an entertainer. The closer to the brink of death, the better. But we keep him alive. [pause] Now, don't get me wrong. We laugh, joke, have fun. But a dead entertainer is not an entertainer at all. Allow me to demonstrate.

The camera lens zooms out. Shuffling is heard in the background for about a minute. SCP-2089-1's head is struck with a blunt object, furthering opening up its wound. SCP-2089-1's brain is exposed. Blood is seen pouring out of the wound.

> Exciting, isn't it? Don't worry, he's very much alive. Just give him time.

The figure pushes SCP-2089-1's body off the chair and proceeds to sit on it. The figure glances at the body lying on the floor.

> Thank you, John. I'm honestly sorry for you having to deal with that amateur. I promise you won't get hurt again.

The figure faces the camera. The camera zooms in so that the figure's face occupies the screen.

> And in case you haven't realized it, this is directed towards you, MrBRASIL. Bitch Mountain is where he stays. //He belongs to me.//
> 
> I told you so, didn't I?
