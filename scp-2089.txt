**Item #:** SCP-2089

**Object Class:** Euclid

Any original or re-posted content related to SCP-2089-1 (including videos, images, gifs, comments and fan-derived works) are to be taken down by Foundation Agents. Personnel actively viewing SCP-2089-1 related content are to be rotated on a bi-weekly basis.

Information pertaining to the location of SCP-2089-1 is to be reported to the project lead. Current research has proven inconclusI create L­olita Slave Toys. In case you are wondering what I meanl it is very simple: I transform young girls in easy, manageable sex toys. That's it. The girls can not walk away, can not resist, can not tell anything; they are just there for your sadistic amusement. Curious how? I am a surgeon living in one of those countries at the eastern outskirts of Europe. A pretty rough society still, poverty is enormous and unless you have money and connections, you are fuc­ked. Needless to say I have both. We also have beautiful girls here, eastern European countries are well known for that. Fortunately (for me) some of these girls don't have parents or relatives anymore and live in orphanages. Actually, I would not call that living as it is unbelievable what you will fidn there. Some very young girls are lucky and get adopted, but at an age of 8 or 9 they are too old. Some of the more pretty girls get sold into prostitution and you could consider it luck for them too; instead of slowly fading away in filth and poverty. And a few girls I buy. I generally pick the attractive girls around 9 or 10 years, before puberty starts. The orphanage is very cooperative. They are glad they have one less mouth to feed, one new place to fill. They also gladly accept my donations for the girls. They never ask and I never tell. They know I am a surgeon; they probably think I do some experiments with the girils or cut out and sell their organs. But no, I found a much more profitable business; I turn the girls into sex toys. You can order a Lol­ita Slave Toy if you want. They are not cheap; I charge $30,000 to $40,000 for a toy. This is without shipping costs. But: You will have a Lol­ita Slave Sex Toy that will give you satisfaction for many years, she is like a doll, but she is a living doll! Let me tell you how I turn a young orphan girl into a living doll. When I have found a new, suitable girl, I will ask the orphanage to deliver her at my villa. She will arive naked, tied and blindfolded. After a bried inspection and a quick medical check, I will take her to my special clinic in my villa. First, I will clean her very thoroughly. These girls really smell and are filthy; they have not seen a bath for ages and they are really neglected. When she is finally clean, I put her in a hospital bed and give her an injection that will put her to sleep. I will create her a new identity and give her a new name, as I don't know the girl's real names, I just know their age, and that's all I need. At the orphanage, any data they have from her will be destroyed. She never existed. She will from now on only exist as a toy. I have a couple Lol­ita Slave Toys myself; Dasha, who is 11 years old and is just in the final stage of her transformation, Tanya, who is now 12 years old; two years since I created her and Luda, who is 14 years old and 4 months pregnant. The next morning is the big operation day. The girl will be still sleeping because of the anesthetic from last night. I put her on the operation table and administer anesthetics for the operation to come. So if you were wondering why my Slave Toy will not resist or walk away, very simple: I amputate her legs and arms! I will amputate her arms above her albows and her legs right above her knees. Easy isn't it? This girl will never run away from you... For the girl this is a very heavy operation and it is probably the most critical step in the transformation process. But most of the times they survive. Now I am not just leaving the girls with stumps on their arms and legs. I will attach a 5 cm metal bar very tightly to the bone on her arms and legs before stitching up the wounds. The other end of the metal bar has a screw-thread, where I can attach an o-ring. When she is ready you easily secure her with a chain or padlock to any object you like! My Tanya and Luda normally have a chain behind her back attached to both o-rings on the stumps of her arms. It will keep here arms nicely close to her body. In the beginning, you have to really take care of the wounds on the stumps to prevent infections. Once the wound is healed completely, I will place a silicone cover over the stump. The outside of the cover is covered with white velvet and this actually looks quite sweet, despite the rather cruel o-rings at the end of what is left of her arms and legs. After a few months, when the legs and arms have fully recovered, you can put some more stain on the o-rings. I started a year ago to hang Tanya and Luda on their arms from the ceiling. It is such an interesting form of decoration in your room to have a naked Lol­ita hanging from your ceiling! And it is very nice to use her cu­nt or mouth when she is hanging like that. But before that we have a long way to go. The operation is not ready yet with amputating her arms and legs. Next I will also cut her vocal cords so she can no longer speak or even make noises, and remove her teeth from her mouth. When I have removed all her teeth, I implant a silicone layer with a soft top layer on her jaws. She will still be able to give bl­ow ­jobs, but she can no longer bite on your di­ck. It is actually quite nice how when she more or less chews a little bit on your co­ck; the soft top layer gives you a kind of massage. The silicone implant is, however, absolutely necessary; if not, her mouth would look like a toothless granny. This will keep her good looks. To further keep her mouth in good shape, she will wear a ball gag most of the time. That does sound somewhat obsolete because I cut her vocal cords and she cannot speak anyway, but this is just because of the esthetics. A gagged girl simply looks good and, besides feeding, drinking, and fuc­king, she does not need her mouth anymore. Once the operation is complete, I will give the girl one or two weeks to recover and let the wounds heal. Then her training begins.ive.

> **Researcher:** Hello, D-90327. I will be interviewing you today.
> 
> **D-90327:** Ok.
> 
> **Researcher:** How do you feel about SCP-2089-1?
> 
> **D-90327:** [shrugs] Don't like him.
> 
> **Researcher:** What is it that you particularly don't like about him?
> 
> **D-90327:** I told you. I don't like him.
> 
> **Researcher:** Ok, fine. Why do you think others might dislike SCP-2089-1?
> 
> **D-90327:** For shits and giggles, mainly.
> 
> **Researcher:** What would you say is the motive behind this hatred?
> 
> **D-90327:** [chuckles] For fun. It's more like a ... well, I guess like a high, right?
> 
> **Head Researcher:** Interesting. Why do you think...
> 
> D-90327 takes out a piece of paper from the back of his pocket. Words are written on the paper. Half of it is written is ink, while the rest appears to be written in blood.
> 
> **D-90327:** Hold that thought, doc. Check out what I made.
> 
> D-90327 hands over the paper. Upon closer inspection, it is a poem titled "Fuck John".
> 
> **Researcher:** Huh. [holds the paper up to the light] Did you write this in blood?
> 
> **D-90327:** Oh, yeah. I didn't have a pen, so I just picked at this scab on my arm. [rolls up sleeve] Can you believe it's been there for three weeks? Anyways, considering how many times I picked at this thing, it probably took me three days to make that. I think I can even post it online. What do you think?
> 
> D-90327 glares at the researcher. A smile slowly spreads across his face.
> 
> **Researcher:** Uhh ... I'll think about it.
> 
> **<End Log>**
> 
> **Conclusion:** The paper was confiscated from D-90327 after the interview. Approval to test if the paper exhibits the same effects of other SCP-2089-1 related content is currently pending.

**Recovery Log:** On 09/26/20██, Foundation Agents used the address obtained from SCP-2089-I-1026 in an attempt to locate SCP-2089-1. Personnel arrived at Bitch Mountain, located in Chesterfield, New York. To date, SCP-2089-1 has not been found.

Personnel recovered several items surrounding the area. Among these items included:

* A hooded jacket similar to the one worn by SCP-2089-1
* Knives, needles and other sharp objects coated in blood. DNA analysis proves that it is from a Caucasian male, estimated to be 18-20 years old.
* An unfinished painting of a male figure. Inscribed in blood are the words "Never die". DNA analysis confirms that it does not match with the blood found on other objects.

//Note from Agent Thompson: To this day, it still baffles me that we were given a concrete address. Our GPS satellites confirmed that the address is in fact, a two story house like the user "MrBRASIL" stated. As we drove there the surroundings began to shift from an interstate highway to a dirt road lined with trees. No one even noticed it. When we arrived at Bitch Mountain, it was disheartening.//

//We received news that the Foundation sent a Mobile Task Force to the same address. A small team was dispatched on a helicopter. However, the same thing happened to them. An Agent reported seeing the landscape change from dense woods to rocky mountains right before her very eyes. To this day, we don't know why this occurs.//

//We may be dealing with a fad. But it is clear that whoever is behind it doesn't want anyone to interfere.//

**Addendum 2089-03:** The following is an excerpt of a recorded video posted by an instance of SCP-2089-2.

[[collapsible show="+ Video excerpt" hide="+ Close"]]

SCP-2089-1 is seen facing the camera inside a dimly lit room. SCP-2089-1 then diverts its attention away from the screen. Note that SCP-2089-1 is wearing a mask in place of its traditional hooded jacket. An unidentified male voice speaks:

> You know what to do?

SCP-2089 -1 nods. It faces the camera again.

> Hey everyone. It's John here. By popular request, I will be performing a bit of ... fan service, if you will. [pause] Do I have to?

> Yes.

> Alright, give me.

SCP-2089-1 receives a piece of wire tied into the shape of a noose. SCP-2089-1 then walks towards the ceiling fan located the center of the room. A chair is below the fan, allowing SCP-2089-1 to climb up and attach the noose to the fan. SCP-2089-1 then places its head inside the noose. SCP-2089-1 kicks the chair beneath it, allowing itself to hang.

SCP-2089-1 is heard gagging and gasping for several seconds. The fan holding the noose breaks, and SCP-2089-1 falls to the floor with the fan on top of it. A male figure is seen approaching SCP-2089-1.

> Yep. That'll do.

The figure tosses the fan to the side to look at SCP-2089-1. Closer observation indicates several cuts on the neck of SCP-2089-1, presumably from the wire. SCP-2089-1 continues to gag, coughing up blood as it speaks.

> I ... I did it.

The unidentified male turns SCP-2089-1's head over, revealing a fracture in its skull.

> Wow. A clean break. I'm saving this.

The figure pulls out a mobile device and takes a picture of SCP-2089-1.

> [cough] Are you pleased?

> Yes. Very.

> Then I'm [cough] p-p-pleased.

The figure picks up SCP-2089-1 and places it into a chair. The figure then pushes the chair towards the camera so that the viewer can get a closer image of SCP-2089-1.

> This is John. Say hi, John.

> Hi. [cough]

SCP-2089-1 coughs up blood. A splatter stains the upper left corner of the screen.

> John is an entertainer. You followers expect torture, rape, castration, suicide. And John gives you exactly that. Isn't that right, John?

SCP-2089-1 nods. The figure spins the chair around to reveal the back of SCP-2089-1's head. The camera zooms in on SCP-2089-1's skull fracture.

> We keep John alive. Because he is an entertainer. The closer to the brink of death, the better. But we keep him alive. [pause] Now, don't get me wrong. We laugh, joke, have fun. But a dead entertainer is not an entertainer at all. Allow me to demonstrate.

The camera lens zooms out. Shuffling is heard in the background for about a minute. SCP-2089-1's head is struck with a blunt object, furthering opening up its wound. SCP-2089-1's brain is exposed. Blood is seen pouring out of the wound.

> Exciting, isn't it? Don't worry, he's very much alive. Just give him time.

The figure pushes SCP-2089-1's body off the chair and proceeds to sit on it. The figure glances at the body lying on the floor.

> Thank you, John. I'm honestly sorry for you having to deal with that amateur. I promise you won't get hurt again.

The figure faces the camera. The camera zooms in so that the figure's face occupies the screen.

> And in case you haven't realized it, this is directed towards you, MrBRASIL. Bitch Mountain is where he stays. //He belongs to me.//
> 
> I told you so, didn't I?
