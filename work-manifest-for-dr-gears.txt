Dad was a somewhat quiet man.  Not shy by any means, but someone who honestly preferred his own company.  He drank and smoked too much, and looked after himself too little, but by and large he was a good, kind man when sober.  My mother loved him, deeply, but at times the strain of it showed.  He loved her, too, but I honestly wonder at times whether he married mom from actual love, or a sense of duty.  They would argue a little...then a lot...then finally explode in some massive, room-clearing blow out.  Afterward, they would eventually make up, and the cycle would restart.

My father was of the opinion that, if he was doing something you didn't like, that was your problem.  He was fine with it, if you have a issue, you deal.  So, when he drank too much and started telling everyone how fucking useless and pathetic we all were, it was our issue to deal with it.  This created some stress.  What's more, dad would randomly go on binges of work at inappropriate times, such as ripping out a door frame and replacing it during Christmas morning, cursing the whole time about how we always slammed the fucking thing too hard, all while mom was in tears, begging him to stop, just wait for a bit, be a family.  He finished the door.

When asked about these moments, he'd always say “it needed doing, nobody else does fuck-all around here but me anyway”, then typically open another beer.  The hardest part was, except for these weird moments of cruelty, he was a very nice man to everyone.  It seemed to make the bad stuff stand out all the more, though.  Some times, he'd just stare at us, and you could see absolutely nothing in his eyes.  Like he was watching an ant hill.

I was about nine or ten when mom threw out dad's rifle.  Dad had gone out hunting instead of doing something with mom for her birthday.  She was mad, and told him that if he did this, she'd throw out his rifle.  He did, so she did.  She actually beat it on the concrete steps outside before hand, and broke it first.  We lived way the hell out in the country, so the sound of the stock breaking echoed for what seemed like hours.  Dad came out of the bedroom, looked at the heap in the trash bin, and just went out to the garage.  Not a word, just walked out, no expression at all.  Mom was livid, and was screaming at him the whole time, and followed out after him.

I went back to my room and hid, like I tried to do when a big fight whipped up, but my window was on the garage side of the house.  I started playing Sonic with the sound up high, but not so high that they might notice.  There was screaming for a while, and I could hear dad doing that thing were he shouts with gritted teeth.  Then...it just stopped.  I thought they'd done that break apart thing, where they regoup for another round, but it stayed done.  I kept playing, only sneaking out to grab food when it got late.  I didn't see anyone until the next morning.

Dad was up early.  It was a Saturday, and I just watched cartoons in the living room, so I was only vaguely aware of him occasionally entering and leaving the house.  He asked me once if I was ok to be home alone for a little bit, and I assume I told him yes.  Ninja turtles was on, so I wasn't really connected with the world then.  It was only about lunch time that I noticed that mom wasn't around.  Dad was out in the garage for a while, and I finally got to ask him about mom when he came back in.

He said that mom and him had a fight, and that mom was gone for a bit.  I got concerned, but he just waved it off and said she'd be back sometime, and to just not worry about it.  I started to ask more, but he gave me a look that said to drop it.  We were silent while he rummaged around under the sink for some white tape and a roll of paper, and I finally asked what he was doing.  He said he was butchering a deer a friend had given him, and that he'd be a while at it.  I just assumed he was having one of those work-fits he got in to, and just tried to stay out of the way.

And that's how it went for a few days.  I didn't want to set off dad any more, even though I was very worried about my mom.  I've always been something of a momma's boy, so this hit me somewhat hard, not having her around.  Dad stayed hidden in the garage, chopping up the deer.  I'd helped him a couple times, but the whole thing was kinda scary for me, so there was all the more reason to just stay hid.  It was summer, and I didn't have a whole hell of a lot of friends, so I just knocked around the house, and dad came in to feed me every so often.

It was my aunt Mary who came by to ask about mom.  She was supposed to call her about some appointment, but never did.  Dad just looked at her, sighed, then told her that he'd go and get her, to just follow him.  I came too, quietly, as we crossed over the little porch to the garage.  He pushed open the door, saying that the light was dead, but you could still probably see her.  My aunt screamed and ran out to her car.  The police came a while later.  Dad just smoked and drank two beers in the mean time, and told me to get changed out of my pajamas.

I didn't see it myself, but the police said he'd cut my mom in to almost four hundred pieces.  He'd taken each one, and wrapped it in butcher's paper, then wrote on the label how that particular piece had pissed him off, or offended him, or how he hated it.  He used jars for some parts, even a glass beer bottle for my mom's ring fingers.  He hadn't gotten through everything, but the parts he had done were racked up over all the walls.  He watched the police pull out the box with my mom's head in it with about as much care as a man waiting for a stop light.  The box had a itemized list on it.

Dad never really showed any emotion again.  When they asked him why, he just said “Because it needed doing”, and that was all.  My dad was never really a well-spoken man, but the things he wrote on my mom's remains were apparently amazing.  The wrapper around my mom's right palm apparently had to be unwrapped and read with a magnifying glass to be seen correctly.  The paper looked black with all he'd written.  He hadn't sworn once on any of them, everything laid out like he was presenting it to a judge.  Which I guess, in a way, he was.

I got asked a lot of questions.  How could I just ignore my dad acting oddly, mom being gone.  That's the thing, it wasn't odd for our house.  It was just...life.  I had a little spurt of celebrity, and again when dad died.  Heart attack, not the electric chair like the state had wanted.  The guy who gave me the announcement seemed almost let down, like a kid denied a toy.  I moved, changed my name, and I have a pretty normal life now.  Pretty much.

I look a lot like my dad, and...I find myself acting like him, from time to time.  I suppose all men do, at some point, but it's especially jarring for me.  I find myself looking around at my home, my wife trying to wrangle the kids, the dishes undone, the damn screen door sticking again, and get the urge to just...lash out.  Fix it all in one stroke, just grab armfuls of un-picked-up toys and throw them in the trash, blast the dishes with a hose, clean the house with a snow-shovel and a scream.

Some days, all I hear from people is the negative.  The wrong.  I didn't do this.  This needs to be done.  Stop that, and come deal with this.  It grates on me, more and more.  As if I don't have enough going on.  As if it's up to me to keep the kids, the house, the marriage, and the whole goddamn world running.  And in a way, it is, I suppose.

Nobody else does fuck-all around here but me anyway.
