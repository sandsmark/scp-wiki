The sweat slid in rivers as he burned.  Inches from the fan blades, the pounding breeze doing next to nothing to relieve the searing fire in his flesh.  Sick for the last two days, Adam's fever had only started to soar over last night, and now he felt as if water would boil in his mouth.  Leaning back, he rubbed his temples, trying to decide whether going to bed was worth having to feel his own burning fever-heat reflected back at him by the pillows.

He tried to take another swallow of water, but his raw throat seemed to clamp shut the second it touched the cool liquid, causing him to gag.  He rose, tossing the cup aside, and stumbled in to the kitchen with the vaguely formed thought of getting something hot to drink instead.  As he turned to the stove, he saw the place on the wall were he had leaned coming in.  He blinked, his overheated brain trying to process what he was seeing.

There was a bloody hand print on the wall, dripping slowly.

He looked down to see his shirt spotted with blood.  His pants, his hair, everything was spotted and dripping blood.  He started to stumble back out of the kitchen, unable to scream for help around his raw throat, but everyone was gone anyway, run to the store for fresh medicine.  He moaned, feeling sharp, shocking pain rocket through his joints with each movement, sending him to his knees.  As he looked, a clear fluid started to replace the blood welling from his skin.  Then his finger sagged.

It just...flopped, like a wilting flower, the knuckles reversing as easily as if it'd been made of dough.  Adam started panting, gently trying to push his finger back up, but it sagged more, then started to drip through his fingers like overheated play dough.  He moaned, trying to rise, but found himself stuck.  He looked down to see his legs starting to puddle around him, flowing in a glaze of bloody and clear fluid.  He watched, barely able to breathe, as a toenail floated out of his shoe.

He groaned, trying to pitch his sagging, flowing body forward, but landed on the floor with a sickening splat.  He felt his face start to flow, the soft tissues pooling in to the carpet, his vision starting to distort and blur as his eyes spread like two brown-yolked eggs on to the carpet.  As he felt his gums and skull start to sag and mush like old, rotting pumpkins, his one consolation was that, finally, he didn't feel like he was burning anymore.

When she came home, his mother assumed he'd thrown up in the hall.  Until she saw the teeth floating in the mess.
