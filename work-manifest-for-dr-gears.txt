**New Research:**

* //"Carnivorous Jellyfish"// - a form of jellyfish with the ability to crawl on modified tentacles, live in air for brief periods, and hunt in packs.  They have a nasty sting, lots of little gnawing teeth, reproduce in large numbers, and have a odd reproductive cycle.
* --//The Nexus of Abandoned Places// - A place that contains all the abandoned locations from everywhere, randomly cycling, from this reality and others...--
* --Some form of story/incident report involving Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd.--
* Work on collaboration story with Prof. Kain.
* New SCP:  a broken time device.  Very steampunk-ish and weird...
* --Add to Kondraki's termination log--
* Water Glitch - a small, slightly sphere-ish area of water that is not working right.
