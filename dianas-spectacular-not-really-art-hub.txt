| So here is my wonderful (not really) collection of SCP art. Fun fact I actually published this too soon earlier and I had to delete it to save it from misunderstood downvote hell. So here we are now lol.

| Miss Sweetie is my favorite SCP, I love her so very much. Here’s some art of her wing lyrics from a tangled before ever After song lol
| Josie was my first favorite SCP. Very, very pure....
| I can’t draw cats but whatever ya know?
| Sweet, Sweet 166. My baby
| 040 is a sweet baby and I love her 
| Iris,,,,, best,,,,,

My SCPs:
Okay so at the time of making this these aren’t up yet but one has two green lights and one has one. Anyways here we are:

| Nichola. I’ll put the number once she’s up. 
|Marie from the SCP I’m currently calling rotting love. Don’t mind the misname on there~
