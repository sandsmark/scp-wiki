**Item #:** SCP-2459

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** A 2 km perimeter has been set up over the zone affected by SCP-2459. Mobile Task Force Phi-12 ("Green Light") is to work with local police and transit authorities to prevent civilians from approaching the area. The town within the perimeter is to remain evacuated, with a local chemical spill and health hazard remaining a cover story. All movement within the perimeter must avoid any travel by road. All roads are to be removed within the perimeter as allowed by local conditions.

MTF Phi-12 is to maintain a supply camp in town. Food and necessary survival supplies are to be provided to the remaining individuals under SCP-2459's effect. All personnel who deliver supplies and engage in waste removal are to be tethered by steel cable to the supply camp, and retrieved from the affected area by reeling in. Class A amnestics are to be administered to all participants involved in supply delivery. Roadside waste must be removed by local authorities, or MTF Phi-12.

Civilians rescued are to be interviewed. Each civilian is to be detained for a minimum of two weeks, placed on an amnestic regimen, and must attend classes regarding the structure of society and proper functioning therein. All citizens must demonstrate understanding and belief in the social structures of their home community before being released. 

**Description:** SCP-2459 is a memetic hazard affecting an area of four intersections within ███ █████, Pakistan. Any person who enters the zone of effect is convinced that leaving the zone is not an option, typically for reasons relating to social standing and protection of property rights. The primary result of this hazard is a large traffic jam that extends throughout the city blocks in the zone of effect. Because the zone consists solely of the roadway, there is no source of water or food available. All food and water must be provided to victims of the memetic hazard. 

The hazard first manifested during a traffic jam the evening of 5 May 2015. When it was observed that the jam was not clearing itself naturally, local police were dispatched to move traffic along. When local police stopped attempting to direct traffic, provincial forces were dispatched. 

The Foundation was contacted on 7 May 2015 as provincial forces started disobeying orders, despite refusing to back down from the task of clearing the traffic. First responders noted that civilians at the edge of the traffic jam appeared confused regarding instructions to move on. Although civilians were leaving their cars and walking around, no one left the roadway at any time. Entrepreneurial civilians within the affected zone had set up outhouses at the edge of the roadway for civilians and were charging for their use. 

An initial sortie sent to rescue a civilian from the rapidly deteriorating conditions entered the zone of effect of SCP-2459 and first appeared lost. When instructed to return, affected personnel refused, stating the importance of locating an appropriate civilian to rescue, first. When ordered to leave, personnel reiterated the importance of the mission. One member attempted to establish rapport with the locals by bartering his meal bars to others. As currency was rapidly becoming concentrated in the hands of the outhouse renters, the Foundation personnel accepted a remaining share in the petrol in the tank of the car of one of the civilians. Memetic anomaly was diagnosed and MTF Phi-4 was dispatched.

As of 8 May 2015, affected civilians were running dangerously low on food and water. Civilians started demonstrating further anomalous memetic effects, and had reached consensus to start accepting petrol as payment for goods and services between them. It was decided that all such transactions should be managed at a central bank, and civilians started siphoning petrol from all vehicle tanks and transferring it to a tanker caught in the effect, rendering the vehicles unfit for travel. 

MTF Phi-12 delivered the first crate of supplies to affected civilians and Foundation personnel on 9 May 2015. Personnel affected by the anomaly have found themselves at the bottom of the social ladder, as they arrived in the zone without vehicle or petrol. Affected personnel have bartered away their equipment in order to participate in the society forming from SCP-2459. Affected personnel request to receive the supplies directly from the Foundation so that they may sell them to the civilians and increase their social standing. Request denied.

MTF Phi-12 completed securing perimeter on 14 May 2015. All unaffected civilians evacuated and amnesticized. Supply drops continue.

MTF Phi-12 attached a retracting cable to rescue personnel for the first time on 18 May 2015. Personnel were subject to the memetic effect within 2 seconds of entering the zone. Cable retraction was successful in retrieving the attached personnel. Retrieved personnel continued to demonstrate memetic infection, complaining that they still had obligations within the zone. Class A amnestics successfully remove the memetic hazard from subjects.

Tethered rescue personnel instructed to attach a harness to retrieve a civilian located at the edge of the road. Task successful. Although Class A amnestics removed the memetic effect from the rescue team, it failed to completely remove the hazard from the civilian. Civilian  kept within the perimeter to interview in order to determine the nature of the memetic hazard. 

A small riot broke out within the zone on 20 May 2015, which was quickly suppressed by affected police. The cause of the riot was a disagreement regarding the dispensation of the rescued civilian's vehicle. Affected individuals meet and debate the situation, agreeing that vehicles and equipment of rescued vehicles are considered abandoned. Methods of claiming abandoned property are not agreed upon, however, suggesting that future riots could result if civilians rescued do not have their vehicles with them. Fifty-three claims on the rescued civilian's petrol share are registered with the tanker driver and zone accountant.

Experiments with rescued civilians took place over the next two months in order to establish proper methods of memetic rehabilitation. An amnestic regimen and cultural lessons prove to be successful for rehabilitation, with hazard removal typically taking two weeks to be successful.

> 
> **Agent Shah:** We can get you better care here. 
> 
> **POI-2459-3:** But what about my car? I can't just abandon it! They'll think that I left it behind. Would you return home, face your wife and tell her you just walked away from the car and now you have nothing?
> 
> **Agent Shah:** You have a wife? Where is she? Wouldn't she want to know where you are?
> 
> **POI-2459-3:** She's at home. And she'll be more concerned that I show up with no car, a broken ankle, and no way to work! No, let me back to my car, and I'll drive it home when the traffic clears, like I'm supposed to. 
> 
> **Agent Shah:** But you've emptied the tank! How can you drive on an empty tank?
> 
> **POI-2459-3:** The petrol is still in my name and I can withdraw it at any time. Now let me return to my car.

> **Interviewed:** POI-2459-12
> 
> **Interviewer:** Agent Mohammed Shah, MTF Phi-12
> 
> **Foreword:** Interview conducted 20 June 2015. Interview 24 hours after rescue from zone of effect. Subject was a taxi passenger, and owned no vehicle within the zone.
> 
> **<Begin Log, 09:17>**
> 
> **Agent Shah:** As I've explained before, no, you can't go back there.
> 
> **POI-2459-12:** Really? You are really keeping me from going back?
> 
> **Agent Shah:** Really. Besides, you were at the bottom of the food chain out there. 
> 
> **POI-2459-12:** I was surviving just fine. I just need a change of clothes and a bath, which I'll get just as soon as my lazy driver finishes taking me home!
> 
> **Agent Shah:** We can get you home faster than your driver.
> 
> **POI-2459-12:** What? No. We already negotiated the fee for driving me home. I'm not going to walk away and let him steal what I paid for.
> 
> **Agent Shah:** We can reimburse you. You'll get home safely, can take care of yourself, and you don't have to be stuck in traffic anymore.
> 
> **POI-2459-12:** I refuse. I can't let him get away with this! He's probably trying to steal my petrol account, as we speak.
> 
> **Agent Shah:** But you did not arrive with any petrol. 
> 
> **POI-2459-12:** No, I earned it. I'm very talented. It's mine now, and you'll see the profit I can make once everything moves on.

> **Interviewed:** POI-2459-52
> 
> **Interviewer:** Agent Mohammed Shah, MTF Phi-12
> 
> **Foreword:** Interview conducted 5 September 2015. Interview 21 days after rescue. Subject underwent amnestic regimen and cultural realignment, and has been identified as rehabilitated. Subject underwent final amnestics course after interview and returned home.
> 
> **<Begin Log, 22:03>**
> 
> **Agent Shah:** Greetings, ███████. Please, sit, have some tea. Are you ready to return home, now?
> 
> **POI-2459-52:** Yes, I should like that. Goodness, have I really been caught in that jam for four months?
> 
> **Agent Shah:** I'm afraid so. For the record, could you please explain a few last details regarding your experience?
> 
> **POI-2459-52:** Certainly, anything if it will help those poor souls. Ask your questions.
> 
> **Agent Shah:** Why were you convinced not to leave the roadway?
> 
> **POI-2459-52:** Well, first thing you have to understand, is that none of us want to be there. We all have destinations, families to go back to, things to do. Being stuck in traffic is just a temporary setback.
> 
> **Agent Shah:** But if the traffic lasts days, then wouldn't it have been easier to just leave the road and walk?
> 
> **POI-2459-52:** Certainly, but then you'd have to leave your car behind. Or abandon your fare. You couldn't do that. You can't make progress if you're just letting the things you own slip through your fingers. What good is it if you make it home, but you have nothing? What sort of fool leaves his valuables to be taken? No, it's better to just wait. The traffic will move eventually. The police were there, working on it.
> 
> **Agent Shah:** But everyone emptied their tanks! How can you move without petrol?
> 
> **POI-2459-52:** We all have petrol, sir. The traffic was slow. We would reclaim our petrol when the time came to move. Until then, we needed it to get our food and water while we waited.
> 
> **Agent Shah:** If it weren't for the rescue operation, there would be no food or water! Dehydration was rampant when we arrived. There are buildings nearby, certainly it would have been easy to bring water from there.
> 
> **POI-2459-52:** And abandon our vehicles? Forfeit our petrol? Certainly not. We decided how these things should work, and we would leave when the traffic cleared.
> 
> **Agent Shah:** But you could have died! Why would you believe waiting was the better thing to do?
> 
> **POI-2459-52:** Sir, I understand the absurdity of our solution now, but please try to put yourself in the shoes of those of us stuck in traffic. If you're not willing to die for your beliefs, what good are they?
