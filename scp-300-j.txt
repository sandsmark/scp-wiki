**Item#:** SCP-300-J

**Object class:** --Shatterproof-- Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-300-J is to be kept in a locked containment box in storage. Level-2 researchers are permitted to --worship-- test SCP-300-J per Site director discretion.

**Description:** SCP-300-J is --the-- a --omniscient-- sentient, --magnificent-- standard brand, --crimson-- red plastic ruler --of the kingdom of storage box 397-E-- with the --supreme gift-- anomalous ability to affect all mention of its --raw power-- existence. No --imperfections-- measurement markings are indicated on its --divine body-- surface.

Once a --peasant-- human acknowledges its --perfection-- existence, SCP-300-J will try to --remind-- convince them that --IT IS-- it is a ruler of a kingdom. SCP-300-J does this by --enlightening-- interrupting all forms of human communication. SCP-300-J's --authority-- compulsion is noted to be easily overcome --not for long, filth--, usually by correcting any statements involving the object.

Once --mortals behold-- visual contact is made with SCP-300-J, it will begin to communicate with observers telepathically, often interrupting thoughts and redirecting them to --its greatness-- its presence.

> Dr. Donald: “I am not worthy of y- fuck... I am not inclined to do that, SCP-300-J. Please tell us, which kingdo- urrgh... where do you hail fr- ah come on!”
> 
> SCP-300-J: “You wish to know of the kingdom from which I hail. Yet you do not understand that I am the one hailed. You'd better get this straight, my rule is beyond measure!”
> 
> Dr. Donald: “Right, I think that's enough. Ending prais- urgh fuck this thing. Ending interview.”
> 
> SCP-300-J: “Tell [[[SCP-1561|that damned crown]]] to stop stealing my glory! This is where I'm drawing the line! Give a crown an inch and he thinks he's a bloody ruler.”
> 
> Dr. Donald: “Oh god.”

//Addendum 300-J-1: It has been discovered that, if left unattended for more that 12 hours, all --worshippers-- stationary within a 10km radius will begin to rotate in order to face SCP-300-J's --glory-- general direction. No Foundation intervention is needed as all affected stationery is easily moved with no side effects.//
