**Item #:** SCP-859

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:**

SCP-859 is stored in a locked container, which is stored in a secure containment chamber at Site ██. SCP-859 must not be removed from its container except with express permission from Level 4 personnel, and experimentation on SCP-859 must only be performed with Class D personnel.

**Description:**

SCP-859 is a spherical mass of dark, unidentified material approximately 11 cm in diameter that appears to be covered in multiple layers of spider webbing. SCP-859 is soft to the touch, and approximates the stickiness of spider webbing, although the strands observed on the object do not come off.

When any living human places their hand on SCP-859, the subject immediately gains an acute arachnophobia as well as severe allergic reactions to any kind of spider venom. See Addendum 859-1 for details.

SCP-859 was discovered in [DATA EXPUNGED] along with the swollen and decayed bodies of 37 individuals who had been [DATA EXPUNGED]. Investigation into the origin of SCP-859 as well as the exact nature of its effect are inconclusive.

**Addendum 859-1:**

**Result:** After showing violent resistance and extreme terror when attempting to expose Subject to an agitated huntsman spider, Subject was restrained and spider placed on Subject. Subject bitten and immediately exhibited symptons of extreme anaphylactic shock. Subject dies within 1 minute of exposure, and attempts at resuscitation result in failure.
