**Item #:** SCP-4872

**Object Class:** Arachnid

**Containment Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** All known instances of SCP-4872 are to be kept inside of a sealed chamber at Site-17. SCP-4872 is to be fed a diet of small flies and other typical arachnid prey. The population of this chamber is never to exceed 50. Interaction with SCP-4872 is not to take place without wearing a padded suit at least six centimeters thick and without any opening greater than one centimeter in size.

Biweekly inspection of SCP-4872's containment cell is to take place in order to search for openings. A secondary containment cell has been erected surrounding the primary chamber in order to prevent leaks. In the event that an instance of SCP-4872 is unaccounted for, personnel are to evacuate the general area while Foundation fumigators sweep the site for arachnids.

**Description:** SCP-4872 is a species of arachnid closely related to //Hadronyche modesta//, or the Victorian Funnel-web spider. Like their relatives, SCP-4872 are shiny black in coloration and have a body length of between 2.5 and 3.5 centimeters. However, despite their relatives' ambush predator behavior, SCP-4872 are active in their pursuit of prey. Although SCP-4872 are capable of sustaining themselves from small bugs, their preferred prey are humans.

SCP-4872 are capable of temporarily collapsing their bodily organs, allowing them to fit into spaces that they otherwise would not be able to access. In addition, the venom of SCP-4872 has anesthesiac properties, which can cause numbness at the point of injection.

**Behavior:** The habitat of SCP-4872 are generally urban districts and suburban centers, such as schools. SCP-4872 will attempt to attach itself to a person's belongings and then infiltrate their home. Generally, SCP-4872 targets individuals between 8 and 12 years of age.

Once SCP-4872 has selected a target, it will attempt to make its way to the brain. This is usually done while the victim is asleep. SCP-4872 will inject its venom near the neck area, and then create an incision large enough for it to fit through. Once it reaches the brain, it will inject venom into the pre-frontal lobe, the occipital lobe, and other areas dedicated to sensory stimulus and memory.

This will put the victim into a temporary coma. However, the venom of SCP-4872 also has hallucinogenic properties. This will cause the subject to experience a "continued" version of their life while asleep. SCP-4872 takes advantage of the brain activity supplied by this to lay its eggs in the folds of the brain. Four weeks later, the eggs will hatch and the larvae will leave its host through the host's ears. Brain activity is believed to be used as a form of sustenance by SCP-4872 and its larvae, as they do not resort to other forms of predation during this time.

Shortly after SCP-4872 and its larvae evacuate, the subject will wake up. These subjects report experiencing between 10 and 20 years of time while in their coma.

**Addendum 4872-2:** DNA Analysis

A D-class subject was exposed to SCP-4872 and allowed to enter the coma state. During the process, D-29810's skull was surgically opened and the eggs belonging to the SCP-4872 instance were removed. SCP-4872 responded by injecting its venom into the brain stem, putting D-29810 into a permanent coma. It is of note that D-29810 owned a Philadelphia pizzeria, and was arrested after several counts of manslaughter. During his coma, he was heard muttering about an unidentified seamstress and their supposed children.

The DNA recovered from the eggs did not match typical arachnid DNA. Instead, the DNA resembled human DNA. Comparison to Foundation-cached DNA databases indicated that some of the eggs had matches to real persons. For instance, a 50% match to an Alabama seamstress, a 40% match to a Philadelphia criminal case lawyer, a 43% match to a Philadelphia dog trainer, and a 12% match to the current mayor of Philadelphia.
