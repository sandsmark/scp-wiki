**Item #:** SCP-083

    **Object Class:** Safe

    **Special Containment Procedures:**
SCP-083 is to be kept under constant video surveillance, with at least one Level 3 staff member on call at all times to respond to security breaches.  Entrance to SCP-083 is permissible to level 1 and 2 personnel with proper clearances, provided they wear a tracking device while inside. 

    **Description:**
Located in the ██████████ block of ███████.  Records show the house was constructed in the 1880's, but ownership and property tax records for the address are missing after ██████.  The last known persons to reside at the address was the ███████ family, but [DATA EXPUNGED].  Since then, the property appears not only have disappeared from the public record, but also to have gone unnoticed or ignored by its neighbors.  Whether this is due to a paranormal effect or not has yet to be determined.

Outwardly, the property appears to be a two-story row house with a basement, with an interior calculated at approximately 366 square meters, which has been confirmed on subsequent interior surveys.  No remarkable energy fluctuations, radiation levels or unidentified substances have been detected on, in or around SCP-083.  The house appears to be in a general state of disrepair, and visual examination of the interior through the windows shows a static floor plan that appears to have been abandoned and neglected for some time.  

However, once inside the house, the interior rooms have been repeatedly observed and documented as fully furnished and well-maintained in a Victorian/Edwardian fashion, though no persons or entities have been found residing in, or providing custodial services for, SCP-083.  [DATA EXPUNGED].  From the inside, the view through the windows is completely conventional, allowing personnel that are inside to observe current street conditions.  So-called "charades tests" conducted by stationing one subject outside a window and another inside the same window have confirmed this "two-way mirror" phenomenon (see Document #083-A).

During follow-up procedures, it was discovered that not only do the interior rooms appear different from the inside, the floor plan of SCP-083 apparently changes, with a different layout and different numbers and kinds of rooms manifesting.  Nineteen walkthroughs of SCP-083 have been conducted to date ██████, and each has produced a unique floor plan with a combined total of 154 different rooms, with 17 of those rooms present on more than one walkthrough, though in differing locations (see Document #083-B).  

No spatial reorganizations have ever been observed or experienced by personnel while inside SCP-083, and although electronic surveillance equipment does function inside SCP-083, attempts to record this spatial phenomenon have largely failed (see Document #083-C). However, each of the 19 floor plans still equaled 366 square meters of space, and in each walkthrough, the front door has so far consistently led directly to the same front parlor, designated FP-0.  It has been recommended that SCP-083 be evaluated as a possible autonomous object. (See Document #083-D and E).

    **Addendum:**  Those with Level 2 clearance and above may access additional documents related to SCP-083. 

**Document #083-A:**
Dr. ██████████ proposed to remove window glass for further analysis of the "two-way mirror" phenomenon, determining from internal examination that Window A of FP-0 could be opened through conventional means, and a pane removed for laboratory analysis.  Approval pending. 

**Document #083-B:**
Upon comparative analysis of all recorded floorplans for SCP-083, it has been observed that the small door in the north wall of FP-0 always opens up to reveal a closet.  Though the dimensions and contents of the closets have varied considerably, a teal and white, "Deluxe Convertible" upright Hoover vaccuum cleaner has been observed among the contents over 60% of the time.  It is unknown why, of the three doors leading from FP-0, this one (and the Hoover vaccuum within) has shown such a high level of conservation when none of the others have.     

**Document #083-C:** Summary of Experiment 083-03
On █████, Dr. ███ ██████ set up three digital video cameras inside SCP-083.  One was placed in the middle of FP-0, a second camera on the second floor between DR-2 and K-4, and a third camera in the basement room ST-1.  The cameras were broadcasting on locked feeds that were monitored by agents stationed in a building across the street, and the camera's locations inside SPC-083 were externally confirmed with EM sensors.  

Observation was conducted for a period of 48 hours, during which no personnel were allowed to enter.  No movements within SCP-083 or any of the rooms were observed, and the camera locations remained fixed.  After 48 hours, agents were sent in to retrieve the three cameras, but only found one, the camera in FP-0, at its electronically-confirmed location.  The other two cameras, and the rooms in which they were placed, were gone, with different rooms in their place.  Despite this, the EM sensors continued to detect the electrical signatures of the other two cameras, indicating that they had not shifted position at all.  

Sweeps of SCP-083 were made hourly for the next 36 hours, and although further room rearrangements were noted, neither of the rigged rooms reappeared, and after 36 hours, the signals diminished below detection thresholds (possibly due to a loss of battery power in the two missing cameras).  Three weeks later, ST-1 and its camera (battery dead) reappeared on the second floor of SCP-083.  The third camera still has not been recovered.

**Note on #083-C:**  Memo
{{Dr. ███ ██████ requested and was granted permission to repeat Experiment 083-03, (catalogued as Experiment 083-05) which resulted in the similar inexplicable loss of six more cameras.  While the foundation is committed to the pursuit of scientific discovery, it has been decided to abandon further experimentation of this type on SCP-083, until a way can be found to do it without overdrafting the department's budget in order to replace "disappeared" equipment.}}

**Document #083-D:**
On █████, Agent ██████████ conducted a walkthrough of SCP-083 and reported evidence of food preparation, describing "a sound like banging pots and pans," and "the smell of cooking meat."  Agent ██████████ was unable to localize the source of the phenomena, nor even to find a kitchen.  Agent ██████████ did eventually encounter a dining room (designated DR-8), but it was clearly in a state of non-use.  Agent █████████ estimated the sounds and smell persisted for approximately 20 minutes before "fading away."  There were no other signs of intruders.

**Document #083-E:**
On █████, smoke was observed emanating from SCP-083's chimney. Agent ████████ was dispatched to investigate and found the location designated SR-12 with burning embers in the fireplace.  SR-12 had been previously documented on SCP-083 Internal Surveys 5 and 6, but in both prior encounters the fireplace was cold and swept clean.  Agent ████████ recovered a partially-burned fragment of newsprint from the fireplace [DATA EXPUNGED], as well as the nub of a █████ cigar.  A sweep of SCP-083 found no other evidence of intruders, and review of video surveillance confirmed no one else entering or leaving the house aside from appropriate personnel at expected intervals. Agent ████████ remained on-site until the fire was out, at which point smoke emanations ceased and did not recur.  Agent ████████ made no alterations to SR-12 and left the premises at ████.  Twenty-four hours later, Agent ████████ returned to SCP-083, but SR-12 was no longer present and has not been found on three subsequent walkthroughs.  Analysis of the █████ cigar did not produce any fingerprints, but did yield a partial DNA fragment that showed it had been smoked by a human male.
