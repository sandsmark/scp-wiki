"This image is one of many from my series of Broken Masquerade legal firm ads. The way I see it, with the Foundation being public in [[[broken-masquerade-hub|Broken Masquerade's setting,]]] organizations dedicated to forming legally stable grounds for arguments against the Foundation's morals and methods and/or helping human and sapient anomalies get back on their feet (if/when released from containment) are going to have a presence.

For Leeward & Warner Legal Solutions, they've got a sensitive backstory that I haven't bothered to write yet, but Leeward is Adam Leeward of the [[[SCP-2708]]] mini-canon, and Warner is... well, maybe you can figure it out from the [[[too-old-to-lie-too-cold-to-love|preexisting context,]]] but I haven't bothered to elaborate on that in writing yet, so you'll just have to wait.

I use Adobe Photoshop through Creative Cloud, because I'm one of those suckers who likes accessibility and rip-off subscriptions. For this specific work, my own photography was used, though I sometimes use images 'licensed for reuse' through Google Image Search if I need to combine a bunch of different images."

"This is the drawing that gets stolen the most so I'm putting it here.

I created and co-run an SCP art blog called [http://securecontainplsno.tumblr.com/ securecontainplsno] but I usually draw more serious art. I tend to use bright colors, thick lines and cartoony proportions, because straight lines are terrible things."

"This piece represents some of the aspects of the Foundation that fascinate me: the complexity, the bizarreness, and the epic scale. Also, I have a trend throughout all my watercolours- the images are in grey-scale, with a specific colour highlighting the SCP's main feature or anomalous properties."

"I've always liked graphics design and minimalism, so it was only natural to try and adapt that to the SCP wiki as well. What had started as a minimalist image of SCP-173 became the first among a long list of minimalist SCPs and movie posters, then fictionalized magazine covers to tie in with the Broken Masquerade canon and recruitment posters. I've got an ever-growing list of requests and ideas, but never enough time to make them all. I'm hoping to one day involve some of my film photography into one of these posters, but that hasn't happened just yet. (Soon…) Style-wise, I'm a fan of minimalism, but also of photomanipulation - especially for my posters and covers that are tied in with the Broken Masquerade canon. It's always fun - and a little unnerving - to try and imagine what these images would look like if the Foundation were real and active. Naturally, with my photography background, I use Adobe Photoshop CS6 for all of my works even though I know Illustrator's better for vector images. Take that, artistic norms!"

"This piece is, of course, a black and white depiction of [[[SCP-1000]]]. Human and SCP-1000's situation present a sharp contrast, as humans bathe in the sunlight while the bigfoots retreat into the darkness. The upside-down structure and the opposite colors serve to strengthen the idea.

I always love drawing skips concerning the 'grander' themes, and prefer more symbolic depictions over the literal ones. My work has gone from focusing on details to providing more organized and smooth images, but this has not changed. I want to make sure to not only present what a skip looks like, but also its features. It is true that drawing in monochrome is sometimes limiting, but the style is also unique in simplifying things and giving them an artistic touch.

Aside from SCP entries, I draw tales and characters, and among other things, logo designs. (I probably drew more CotBG & Sarkicism and Pitch Haven stuff than I should have.) I also made a set of SCP Tarot Cards, which I'm rather proud of. [[[GOI Ball Comics]]] is another thing I do, taking a break from the black and white style."

"I love making whimsical vector art - as a former graphic design student with no talent for 'analog' drawing, it feels good to have a quick method to transcribe the images in my head into art. In my opinion, one of the greatest aspects of the SCP Foundation is the juxtaposition of tones — that even in the face of K-class scenarios, comedy and tragedy can work alongside each other, enhancing the effects of both. The infamous SCP-999/SCP-682 crosstest is one such example, and I wanted to capture the personalities of both anomalies, and how they would influence each other. For example, I believe that SCP-999 tries to emulate SCP-682's toughness in its presence, coming off more as mischievous."

"If I had to say any reason as to why I like it, I think it'd be because the style of it is fairly different from what I normally do. It's far more cartoony and honestly was drawn a lot faster than some of my normal pieces (in which I like to focus more on plenty of details and such) and honestly it appeals to me more than some of my other, more large-scale works.

As someone who is an art student I'd say its important to explore different drawing styles, and given the masses of material to work with on this site (along with an array of different themes) it has definitely been easy and very fun to do so."

"I love the variety in all the SCPs. All the different kinds of dangers and mysteries behind them really fascinates me! The proposals for SCP-001 are my favorites; they leave you pondering on which one is real, and what that would mean for the Foundation. So I thought I would try my hand drawing one of them in a kind of stylized way. It's fitting, after all, that a drawing of an SCP would be more of an abstract representation of it, considering how little we really know about them."
