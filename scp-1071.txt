**Item #** SCP-1071


**Classification:** --Safe-- Euclid


**Special Containment Procedure:** All instances of SCP-1071-1 and -2 are to be kept in separate containment lockers in Site ██'s storage, with access allowed by level 3 or higher permission. The contents of all instances of SCP-1071-3 are to be cataloged and kept in the archives for future reference. It should be noted that it is possible that not all instances of SCP-1071 have been contained, and that some may still be in circulation. During the school year, SAT Testing should be monitored to detect possible instances of SCP-1071.


**Description:** SCP-1071 is the collective name for the answer sheets (SCP-1071-1) and the test booklets (SCP-1071-2) from the SAT Reasoning Test. When not being used, SCP-1071-1 and -2  are ordinary SAT testing materials distributed from the years 200█ onwards. Reading through them without meeting the activation criteria shows that the questions consist of several mathematics, literature, history, science, and language questions, as is to be expected. There are currently ████ instances of SCP-1071 in storage at Site ██.


SCP-1071 is activated when an instance of SCP-1071-1 and -2 are brought together, and the subject's name is inscribed upon the exterior of the booklets with a #2 pencil. Regardless of current educational status, the Test Taker will take SCP-1071 as if it were an actual SAT Reasoning Test. The subject can leave at any time, but doing so before completion of  at least 60% the test or expiration of the testing period (determined to be three hours and thirty minutes) results in a failing grade. Attempts to observe the contents of SCP-1071-1 and -2 during the duration of the test are futile; the paper appears blank to all outside observers. After the test is completed, the Test Taker cannot remember the contents of SCP-1071, even under hypnosis. They will, however, consistently mention that the essay question was the easiest part of the test.


Approximately three (3) weeks after completion of the test, an envelope (designated SCP-1071-3) appears in the Test Taker's current place of residence, regardless of whether or not there is a mailbox, or even a mail delivery service, available. SCP-1071-3 can only be opened by the Test Taker, and will contain the results of SCP-1071. It should be noted that the results refer to SCP-1071 as the "Improvement Test", rather than the SAT Reasoning Test. The results of this test are not consistent with the scoring system for the SAT; instead of being calculated in a numeric value up to 2400, the results instead take the form of a form letter. The form letter informs the the Test Taker of one of two results: they either scored proficiently on the test, which produces no results, or they have failed the test.


Test Takers who receive the "fail"  become the subject of passive-aggressive tendencies from other human beings. Subjects who have "failed" SCP-1071 have reported relationships failing, being fired from several consecutive jobs, neighbors filing petty complaints against them, and an increase in suspicion from law enforcement and government workers. Test Takers also report an increase in technology failing and incidents of animal aggressiveness. As time progresses, these tendencies become more and more harmful to the Test Taker, escalating from various verbal slurs, to assault, and finally to sexual crimes and attempted murder. Death of the Test Taker immediately ends all aggressive actions, often leaving the tormenters feeling remorse for their actions.


However, in ███ recorded instances, SCP-1071-3 has come back without containing standard results; instead, it contains a slip of paper with the words "Congratulations. You've passed." written on it. Within 24-48 hours of receiving this result, the Test Taker will experience feelings of euphoria and contentment, after which [DATA EXPUNGED]. Whereabouts of Test Takers who receive this result are currently unknown, suspected to be [DATA EXPUNGED].


**Incident OOO-15:** D-58921 was selected for exemption from termination after receiving a "fail" result from SCP-1071 in order to study the detrimental effects. D-58921 has scored 92 on a standard IQ test- below average- and has a history of self-esteem issues, a factor which led to their imprisonment and eventually employment as D-Class.  Four weeks after the result was received, D-58921 attempted to ingest rat poison collected from the D-Class kitchen. The following interview was conducted by Dr. ███████, with Agent ████ supervising.

Dr. ███████ and Agent  ████ were reprimanded for their conduct during the interview.

//Note: I have no idea what the hell came over me. I just lost my temper! I didn't know what I was saying! Requesting to upgrade to Euclid immediately.//-Dr. ███████

//It seems as if though we have all instances of SCP-1071 in containment, and they can all be safely kept in a storage locker. Nobody HAS to take SCP-1071. Request denied.//-O5-█.

**Incident 1071-17:** Reports of anomalous SAT Reasoning Tests came in from the town of [REDACTED]. As it was possible that these were uncontained instances of SCP-1071, agents were dispatched to attempt to collect the tests. Agents failed in acquisition of over ███ instances of SCP-1071-1 and -2, but were able to intercept all results. When the envelopes containing the results refused to open, items were confirmed as SCP-1071-3 and incinerated. It should be noted that [REDACTED] has one of the lowest performing school systems in the United States. Students were allowed to re-take a proper SAT Reasoning Test at a later date.

//If this doesn't qualify it as Euclid status, I don't know what does! It's popping up outside the facility, and it's targeting low-performing school systems! If the Agents hadn't gotten the results, we'd have a lot of messed-up kids on our hands right now. I am re-submitting my request to upgrade to Euclid, or at the very least, set up monitoring of schools participating in the SAT.//- Dr. ███████.

//Both requests approved. Euclid status recognized, and all schools participating in the SAT test are to be monitored for reports of behavior consistent with SCP-1071 activation.// - O5-█
