**Item #:** SCP-1373

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** The remains of SCP-1373-09 are preserved in a glass jar in Doctor Eldrake's office, with all other SCP-1373 samples preserved and stored in standard Safe-class containment lockers. All researchers with level 2 clearance or above are allowed to experiment with SCP-1373, with written consent from the current head researcher of SCP-1373, --Doctor Burns-- Doctor Eldrake.

**Description:**  SCP-1373-01 through -09 are the bodies of 8 expired albino shark fetuses recovered from the womb of a pregnant dusky shark caught off the coast of California on ██/█/11. Cursory examination reveals instances of SCP-1373 are afflicted with cyclopia, an extremely rare congenital disorder. Upon recovery, SCP-1373 was designated Anomalous Object US-9245-B due to the extreme unlikelihood of all 8 offspring having cyclopia, and the presence of a faded tattoo reading "The Factory" under the left pectoral fin of SCP-1373's mother.

SCP-1373's anomalous effects were discovered during standard anomalous testing procedures, where the eye of SCP-1373-09 were found to be able to emit a green laser upon tugging backwards and downwards on the object's dorsal fin. The intensity of the laser could be adjusted according to the pressure exerted on the fin, peaking at a maximum output of 50 kW with 30 N of force applied. This is sufficient to burn through metal at close ranges of 50-100 cm. SCP-1373-09 was later dissected for in-depth examination, with the remains preserved and stored.

It appears SCP-1373 generates laser using natural Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) as a gain medium, and its eyes are incapable of sight, instead being filled with a large amount of "laser cells" containing four microscopic reflective surfaces. An unidentified bio-luminescent organ has replaced the brain of SCP-1373, functioning as a light source for the laser and directly manipulated by the dorsal fin. It is unknown how the eye of SCP-1373 is able to withstand the high temperatures of its own laser. The lack of a functional eye and brain, along with the tattoo found on the mother of SCP-1373, strongly implies that SCP-1373 is a mass produced Factory product, and many more instances of SCP-1373 may still remain uncontained. MTF-Theta-13 ("Shark Punchers") is to be assigned to search and contain other instances of SCP-1373.

**Addendum:** SCP-1373-10 through -16 were recovered from the womb of a similar pregnant dusky shark on ██/██/11, approximately 160 km east from the recovery point of SCP-1373-01 through -09. SCP-1373-10 through -16 appear to be an advanced model of SCP-1373, with power output approaching 100 kW, able to burn through metal at roughly twice the range of its predecessors. More importantly, a note was found inside the womb, attached to SCP-1373-13. Refer to Attachment-1373-A for details.
