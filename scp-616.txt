**Item #:** SCP-616

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-616 is to be in site [REDACTED]. SCP-616 should not be boarded by anyone lacking strong religious faith of any inclination, even while grounded. All personnel must pass a lenghty approval process conducted by [REDACTED]. Any personnel that do not report dizzyness, headaches, and discomfort in the presence of SCP-616 are to be considered unsuitable for containment purposes, prevention of SCP-616's opening, or procedure 600-Shoki. 

Before each flight, seven suitable personnel of different faiths must be present on board. A single Foundation personnel, also of deep religious faith and fitting all the same requirements is to be present on board for communication purposes, and should remain six (6) meters from SCP-616-1 at all times. All personnel should be supplied with any religious paraphernalia they request before flight time. No extraneous personnel are to be present during flight for any reason, as it facilitates [DATA EXPUNGED] and provides corpses for [DATA EXPUNGED].

During flight, personnel are to enact whatever measures they each see fit to maintain SCP-616-1 closed, as this task seems to require faith or belief rather than physical force or a particular procedure. Extreme efforts to remain away from the doorway's opening must be taken, as [DATA EXPUNGED]. Should efforts to keep the door from fully opening fail, [DATA EXPUNGED] and procedure 600-Shoki is to be enacted.

**Description:** SCP-616 is a prototype Boeing ███-███, designed by █████ █████████ and constructed in 16/06/1966 to specifications. Though superficially similar to the Boeing 737 which went into service shortly afterwards, SCP-616's model had various internal alterations, including [DATA EXPUNGED]. Though many of these differences are perhaps more noticeable, of note is the third emergency exit door on the left side of the aircraft, which has been dubbed SCP-616-1. SCP-616-1 opens inwards, not outwards as in most aircraft, and contains [DATA EXPUNGED].

Long-term observation or exposure to SCP-616 without electronic devices is not recommended at any time. Observation using any sort of electronic device is satisfactory while SCP-616 is grounded, though some visual anomalies have been recorded, including [DATA EXPUNGED]. As such, it is advised that personnel assigned to observation duty work no longer than three (3) consecutive days, and report to psychological counseling if feeling any anxiety due to observation of SCP-616. 

Every 138 hours, SCP-616 will attempt to take off, despite remaining unpiloted. It seems to be able to do this regardless of damage to its flight systems or lack of a fuel source. Attempting to physically prevent SCP-616 from take off is not recommended, as it has resulted in [DATA EXPUNGED]. Once SCP-616 reaches an altitude of about 10972 meters and a speed of about 780 km/h, SCP-616-1 begins to [DATA EXPUNGED] and will attempt to open. At this point, anyone not of a deep religious conviction will [DATA EXPUNGED]. Cabin pressure may destabilize, extreme 'turbulance' is encountered, and all present personnel report feeling as if SCP-616 is quickly falling, even though it has been ascertained that SCP-616 remains in stable crusing conditions during all times. Should any individuals be forced through the open door-way, [DATA EXPUNGED]. Please see Document SCP-616-█ for further information on [DATA EXPUNGED] and effective means of termination.

Corpses with an undamaged larynx present in SCP-616 once SCP-616-1 activates semingly reanimate for the duration of the flight. These corpses do not pose a physical threat, but their speech may pose psychological dangers as well as enable SCP-616-1's opening. Recordings of the language spoken by reanimated corpses is heard by all listeners to be said in their native language, though garbled, and the only discernible words have been found are, in English: ████ ██████████ █ ██████ ███████ ███ ███████. These words appear to induce panic in those who hear them, and in some cases [DATA EXPUNGED].

Though attempts have been made to observe and record SCP-616 during flight, all recorded footage containing a shot of SCP-616 opening become altered to display images that, when viewed, cause various psychological and physiological changes including physical illness, panic attacks, violent and suicidal outbursts, and in extremely rare cases [DATA EXPUNGED]. 

On █/█/████, A remote controlled rover obtained footage from within SCP-616-1. All personnel who viewed this footage directly subsequently committed suicide by various means within a week. A back-up security tape recording the original footage being played did not cause any death, despite containing full sound and color recordings of the footage. It displayed a video of a small child violently being [DATA EXPUNGED]. All further attempts to observe within the space of SCP-616-1 have yielded similar results, and such expeditions are no longer permitted.

**Addendum 616-01**: The airliner series never went into service, as the various anomalous events surrounding SCP-616's test flights were reported as various design failures. All plans and blue-prints have been seized by the Foundation, It is now believed █████ █████████ design's were entirely intentional and done under no external compulsion. Recovered documents from the construction process describe [DATA EXPUNGED].
