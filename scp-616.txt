**Item #:** SPC-616

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Only an ordained and believing minister of an Abrahamic faith with security clearance of level four or above may examine the door, and must remain at least 0.94m (3ft, 1in) from the threshold of the door at all times. Non-ordained or non-Abrahamic clergymen must remain 9.17m (30ft, 1in) from the door's threshold. Violation of this distance will result in [DATA EXPUNGED] or [DATA EXPUNGED] of particular subject(s).

SCP-616 is to be kept at the exact center of a spherical subterranean chamber with a diameter of 400m. Two 200-megaton nuclear devices are to be armed inside the chamber at all times. In the event of an XK-Class End-of-the-World scenario, or if the door opens, resulting in [DATA EXPUNGED], [DATA EXPUNGED], or transfers hostile beings in large numbers that jeopardizes the Containment Site and its environs, these devices are to be detonated.

Seven archbishops, ordained and believing in an Abrahamic faith, must surround SCP-616 on the surrounding catwalk at a distance of 3.05m (10ft) from SCP-616 at all times. Said archbishops must continuously pray; failure to adhere to this protocol has resulted in the door opening, apparently of its own accord. The results of the door opening are detailed in documents SCP-616-█, SCP-███-█, and SCP-████-█.

In addition, the Pope (or a similar Abrahamic religious figure) must bless the chamber in accordance with the appropriate religious ceremony once per full year. The official must report to the Foundation and arrive physically at the Containment Site at least three days prior to the year elapsing. Failure to do so may result in the door opening, resulting in [DATA EXPUNGED]. In the unlikely event that any official misses the ceremony, a substitute of equal rank must be on hand to replace him or her.

All corpses of those who have died in relation to SCP-616 must be immolated within midnight of that day.

**IMPORTANT**: All personnel involved with SCP-616 must submit to a polygraph test. Any personnel found to have participated in the occult, especially that of Satanic or pseudo-Satanic origin, are not to be allowed in the containment chamber.

**Description:** SCP-616 was the door located in the ‘red room’ of █████ █████████’s house, commissioned in 16/06/1946. Recovered documents from the construction company describe an odd-looking door found on the site of the house. It appears the construction workers built the 'red room' around the door itself, although recovered blueprints do not contain or mention the 'red room'. Upon completion of the 'red room', all workers were found dead, by various means of suicide. Agents that had arrived on scene described the deaths as "horrific".

An SCP team extracted the door from the home by recruiting Class D personnel known to be strong in Abrahamic faith. The personnel were ordained by the ████████████ as cardinals for the task. The entire door assembly was removed; this included the frame, hinges, and lintel. The assembly was lifted out with a crane and loaded into a flatbed truck, where it was moved to Containment Facility ████████████. It should be noted that SCP-616 did not take hostile action against said Class D personnel during or after the removal and movement to the facility.

Long-term observation of SCP-616 without electronic devices is not recommended. Observation using any sort of electronic device is satisfactory, though some visual anomalies have been recorded, including [DATA EXPUNGED]. As such, it is advised that personnel with a high tolerance against sudden displays of violent and/or disturbing imagery be used as observation personnel. Attempts have been made to observe and record past the minimal distance allowed for non-ordained/non-Abrahamic personnel via remote-controlled drone, dubbed the "event horizon". All recorded footage past the "event horizon", however, becomes altered to display images that, when viewed, cause the viewer to become violently suicidal, regardless of tolerance to images of violence, abstract shapes and events, or disturbing events. In extremely rare cases, they may [DATA EXPUNGED], posing extreme threats to personnel and the facility. Please see Document SCP-616-█ for further information on [DATA EXPUNGED] and effective means of termination. Additionally, see below for more details regarding recorded footage of SCP-616.

If a person dies as a result of SCP-616 and the corpse is not immolated by midnight of that day, the corpse will reanimate and become hostile to all living beings. Recordings of the language spoken by reanimated corpses have been shown to be heard by every listener in their native language, though garbled. The only discernible words we have found are, in English: ████ ██████████ █ ██████ ███████ ███ ███████. These words appear to induce extreme terror in those who hear them. Although the corpses are significantly easier to terminate than aforementioned [DATA EXPUNGED], they are still significant threats to personnel. In the unlikely event that a corpse is not disposed of and reanimates, complete destruction of the body is required, preferably using flame-based or explosive weaponry.

Amplification devices were placed three feet from the door by rover on █/██/████. D-class personnel just outside of the "event horizon" were to try and establish a conversation to test for sapience. The door answered, apparently telepathically. When the door began ‘speaking’, all personnel in attendance died when [DATA EXPUNGED] via various orifices in their body. Clean-up teams were dispatched, but were forced to use improvised rovers for clean up due to [DATA EXPUNGED].

On █/█/████, A remote controlled rover obtained footage from within the door. All personnel who viewed this footage directly subsequently committed suicide by various means. A security tape of the video with the recording playing did not cause any death, despite containing full sound and color recordings of the footage. It displayed a video of a small child violently being [DATA EXPUNGED]. All further attempts to observe past the "event horizon" have yielded similar results, and such expeditions are no longer permitted.
