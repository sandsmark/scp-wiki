**Item #:** SCP-616

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-616 is to be kept in site [REDACTED]. SCP-616 should not be boarded by anyone lacking strong religious faith of any inclination, even while grounded. All personnel must pass a lenghty approval process conducted by [REDACTED]. Any personnel that do not report dizzyness, headaches, and discomfort in the presence of SCP-616 are to be considered unsuitable for containment purposes, prevention of SCP-616-1's opening. 

SCP-616-1 should be kept from opening at all costs, and each flight should be manned for this reason. Failure to keep SCP-616-1 from opening fully will require initiation of Procedure 600-Shoki.

Each flight, a minimum of seven (7) suitable personnel of different faiths must be present on board during take-off. A single Foundation personnel, also of deep religious faith and fitting all the same requirements is to pilot SCP-616 and view the events around SCP-616-1 remotely, and be available for communication purposes. Under no circumstances is the pilot cleared to approach SCP-616-1 once flight has begun. All personnel should be supplied with any religious paraphernalia they request before flight time. No extraneous personnel are to be present during flight for any reason, as they will most likely be killed by SCP-616's opening, and provide corpses for reanimation.

During flight, personnel are to enact whatever measures they each see fit to maintain SCP-616-1 closed, as this task seems to require faith or belief rather than physical force or a particular procedure. Extreme efforts to remain away from the doorway's opening must be taken, as personnel may be pulled in. Should efforts to keep the door from fully opening fail, procedure 600-Shoki is to be enacted.

**Description:** SCP-616 is a prototype Boeing ███-███, designed by █████ █████████ and constructed in 16/06/1966 to specifications. Though superficially similar to the Boeing 737 which went into service shortly afterwards, SCP-616's model had various internal alterations, including [DATA EXPUNGED]. Though many of these differences are perhaps more noticeable, of note is the second emergency exit door on the middle-left side of the aircraft, which has been dubbed SCP-616-1. SCP-616-1 opens inwards, not outwards as in most aircraft, and contains extensive markings in an unknown script. SCP-616 can be opened without major incident, and in these cases is seen to lead to the outside of the aircraft as expected, but this is discouraged as personnel performing these tests have reported severe anxiety problems and a persistent feeling of being watched.

Long-term observation or exposure to SCP-616 without electronic devices is not recommended at any time. Observation using any sort of electronic device is satisfactory while SCP-616 is grounded, though some visual anomalies have been recorded, including [DATA EXPUNGED]. As such, it is advised that personnel assigned to observation duty work no longer than three (3) consecutive days, and report to psychological counseling if feeling any anxiety due to observation of SCP-616. 

Every 138 hours, SCP-616 will attempt take-off, even if remaining unpiloted. This is not recommended however, as leaving SCP-616 unpiloted means the foundation is unable to control its destination. SCP-616 is able to fly regardless of damage to its flight systems or lack of a fuel source. Attempting to physically prevent SCP-616 from take off is not recommended, as it has resulted in SCP-616 beginning opening whilst still on ground level, and affecting all individuals within a two (2) kilometer radius, and requiring immediate use of Procedure 600-Shoki.

Once SCP-616 reaches an altitude of about 10,972m and a speed of about 780 km/h, SCP-616-1 begins to open. Cabin pressure will then destabilize, extreme 'turbulence' is encountered, and all present personnel report feeling as if SCP-616 is quickly falling, even though it has been ascertained that SCP-616 remains in relatively stable cruising conditions during all times. Anyone present who is not of a deep religious conviction will feel compelled to help open SCP-616-1 and walk through it, though the strength of this compulsion has been observed to be of different degrees. Should any individuals enter the opening doorway, either voluntarily or by force, [DATA EXPUNGED]. Please see Document SCP-616-█ for further information on [DATA EXPUNGED] and effective means of termination. Shoulder SCP-616-1 open fully, potentially hundreds of [DATA EXPUNGED].
 
Corpses with an undamaged larynx present in SCP-616 once SCP-616-1 activates semingly reanimate for the duration of the flight. These corpses do not pose a physical threat and are unable to move, but should be terminated if possible as they are capable of speech which may pose psychological dangers as well as enable SCP-616-1's opening. Recordings of the language spoken by reanimated corpses is heard by all listeners to be said in their native language, though garbled, and the only discernible words have been found are, in English: ████ ██████████ █ ██████ ███████ ███ ███████. These words appear to induce panic in those who hear them, and in some cases [DATA EXPUNGED].


**Addendum 616-01**: The airliner series never went into service, as the various anomalous events surrounding SCP-616's test flights were reported as various design failures. All plans and blue-prints have been seized by the Foundation, It is now believed █████ █████████ design's were entirely intentional and done under no external compulsion. Recovered documents from the construction process describe [DATA EXPUNGED].
