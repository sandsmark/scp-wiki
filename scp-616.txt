**Item #:** SPC-616

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Only an ordained and believing minister of an Abrahamic faith with security clearance of level four or above may examine the door, and must remain at least 0.9 metres from the threshold of the door at all times, the exact measure is 0.94m (3ft, 1in), non-ordained or non-Abrahamic clergymen must remain 9.17m (30ft, 1in). Violation of this distance will result in [DATA EXPUNGED] or [DATA EXPUNGED] of particular subject(s).

It is to be kept at the exact center of a spherical subterranean chamber with a diameter of 400 metres. A nuclear device rating 200 megatons is to be armed inside the chamber at //all times//. In the event of an XK-Class End-of-the-World scenario, this device is to be detonated.

Long-term observation without electronics or otherwise is not recommended. Observation using any sort of electronic advice is  satisfactory, though some visual anomalies have been recorded. Attempts have been made to observe and record past the minimal distance allowed for non-ordained/non-Abrahamic personnel via remote-controlled drone. All recorded footage past the "event horizon", however, becomes altered to display images, when viewed, cause a viewer to become violently suicidal. In extremely rare cases, they may [DATA EXPUNGED], posing extreme threats to personnel. Please see Document SCP-616-█ for further information on [DATA EXPUNGED] and effective means of termination. Additionally, see below for more details regarding recorded footage of SCP-616.

It is necessary for seven archbishops, ordained and believing, to at all times surround at a distance of 3.05m (10ft) the artifact on the surrounding catwalk. They must continuously pray; failure to adhere to this protocol has resulted in the door opening, apparently of its own accord. The results of the door opening are detailed in document SCP-616-█, SCP-███-█, and SCP-████-█.

In addition, the Pope (or a similar Abrahamic religious figure of equivalent belief) must bless the chamber in accordance with the appropriate religious ceremony once per full year. The official must report at least three days prior to the year elapsing. Though failure means that the door may open, the ceremony is one that is of utmost importance -- it is highly unlikely that any one official will miss the ceremony, but if such an event occurs, a substitute //must// be selected. The containment chamber has been blessed twelve (12) times by the ████████████ himself.

All corpses of those who have died in relation to SCP-616 must be immolated within midnight of that day, failure to do so will result in hostile reanimation. Recordings of the language spoken by reanimated corpses have been shown to be heard by every listener in their own language, though garbled. The only discernible words we have found are, in English: ████ ██████████ █ ██████ ███████ ███ ███████. While significantly easier to terminate than aforementioned [DATA EXPUNGED], they are still significant threats to personnel. In the unlikely event that a corpse is not disposed of and reanimates, complete destruction of the body is required, preferably by flame-based weaponry.

NOTE: All personnel involved with SCP-616 must be polygraphed as regards to any participation in the occult. Personnel having done so must not be allowed in the containment chamber.

**Description:**SPC-616 was the door located in the ‘red room’ of █████ █████████’s home. It was found by construction workers in the late 1940’s. It appears they built the 'red room' around the door itself - recovered blueprints do not contain the 'red room'. Upon completion of the red room, all workers were found dead, by various means of self-termination.

An SCP team extracted the door from the home using by recruiting Class D personnel known to be strong in Abrahamic faith. The personnel were ordained by the ████████████ as cardinals for the task. The entire door assembly was removed; this included the frame, hinges, and lintel. The assembly was lifted out with a crane and loaded into a flatbed truck, where it was moved to containment facility ████████████.

Amplification devices were placed three feet from the door by rover on █/██/████. D-class personnel just outside of the "safe" zone were to try and establish a conversation to test for sapience. The door answered, apparently telepathically. When the door began ‘speaking’, all personnel in attendance died when [DATA EXPUNGED] via their ear canals. Clean-up teams were dispatched.

On █/█/████, A remote controlled rover obtained footage from within the door. All personnel who viewed this footage directly subsequently self-terminated by various means. A security tape of the video with the recording playing did not cause any death, despite containing full sound and color recordings of the footage. It displayed a video of a small child violently being [DATA EXPUNGED]. All further attempts to observe past the "event horizon" have yielded similar results, and have ceased.
