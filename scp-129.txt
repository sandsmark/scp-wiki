**Item #:** SCP-129

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-129 is already at large in the world, infecting numerous humans daily. Though natural immunity to SCP-129 is latent in 98% of the population, outbreaks that progress past Stage Three (described below) should be contained as quickly and swiftly as possible. Please see Document #129-A-1 for information on Foundation policy to treat and contain patients suffering Stage Three or higher infections.

Personnel of Level 4 or higher, please see Document #129-A-2 for special containment procedures in the event of a Stage Four-2 outbreak.

**Description:** SCP-129 is a series of microscopic spores that infect all animals with mucosal membranes. It is primarily airborne, and is unique in that what this document terms SCP-129 is actually a series of no less than twenty-one (21) different fungal species, each of which infects the host and breaks down resistance to the next stage. Due to events in the past, many humans are naturally immune to SCP-129-4 and onwards, much similar to leprosy. As such, emergence of Stage Three infections are incredibly rare, but at the same time incredibly dangerous. Each stage of infection by SCP-129 is decribed below.

----

**Stage One :** The first organism, SCP-129-1, attacks the victim's mucosal membranes, multiplying quickly and unobtrusively. A faint yeast-like smell might be detected, but beyond that, SCP-129-1 is asymptomatic. A second organism (SCP-129-2) infects the host, causing the victim to experience symptoms identical to that of acute viral nasopharyngitis (the common cold). The decreased efficacy of the host's immune system due to infection from SCP-129-2 allows SCP-129-1 to become entrenched further.

SCP-129-1 and -2 generally leave the host body within two weeks to a month. Though most of the population has little to no protection against SCP-129-1 and -2, their threat levels are low, unless SCP-129-3 manages to infect the host within the time frame.

**Stage Two :** SCP-129-3 is usually stopped by natural mucus. However, Stage One alters the composition of the host enough so that SCP-129-3 is able to establish a foothold. SCP-129-3 actively alters the host's mucous, salivary, and sweat glands so that they secrete a substance that is identical in every way to normal mucus, exception that it is able to support all fungal organisms under the classification of SCP-129. 

Symptoms of Stage Two infection include increased sweating and salivating, a somewhat increased preference for vegetables, and the complaint that certain fruit juices 'taste odd'.

SCP-129-3 generally is fought off by the immune system within four months. Fever and flu-like symptoms result, but with few fatalities, those usually resulting from the lungs filling up with mucus. Almost 40% of all humans have passed into Stage Two at one point or another. Only 0.01% of that 40% have experienced Stage Three.

**Stage Three :** SCP-129-4 through -8 attach themselves to the host. As opposed to SCP-129-1 through -3, these infestations are permanent and almost impossible to remove once identified due to mycelium becoming well-established in the host's circulatory system. After one organism from Stage Three infects the host, appearance of the other four almost immediately follows. The signaling device is unknown.

The nose, eyes, and rectum all take on notably yeasty smells. After a period of one to three weeks, fungal balls begin developing in the nose and large intestine. These are ejected from the host's body, and are usually no larger than 2 cm diameter.

No more than one eye develops a cataract (usually the left, for reasons unknown). Within a day, the host loses vision in that eye, and within a week, the affected eye experiences paralysis. The immobile eye turns a leathery, dull brown, and 'weeps' brown spores from the original location of the pupil. These spores trigger Stage One and Two infections in 65% of those who come in contact with them.

Hair falls out, only to be replaced by fair, light blond strands. As is to be expected, these are hyphae of SCP-129-6 through -8. Upon falling out, these strands dissolve into spores that are carried away by the wind.

Certain other transformations occur, such as altering brain chemistry to avoid people, the drive to seek well-traveled spots, pulling of hair and spitting. Blood plasma is also seeded with spores at this point, meaning only total incineration of the victim can prevent possible spread. Progression to Stage Four-1 or Stage Four-2 invariably happens within two months.

**Stage Four-1:** Introduction of SCP-129-9 through -21 (again, occurring within a week of each other) occurs. At this point, all anatomical and physiological Stage Three changes slowly revert to the beginning to Stage Three, such that the host appears completely human. Near normal mental processes resume. This "roll-back" effect has occurred in all observed cases of Stage Four-1. Lasting symptoms include psychological alteration (such as increased sociability, charisma, and overall need to be around other people), as well as the patient continuing to be a carrier of SCP-129, with direct or indirect contact causing Stage One infections or advancing infections in those already afflicted. Minor physical symptoms include persistent sniffling and sneezing (which will usually be attributed to allergies or colds).

As a side note, the host will also gain remarkable immunity against almost all bacterial infections.
