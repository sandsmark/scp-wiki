**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to the cessation of their production on behalf of the Foundation, SCP-4659 has been deemed effectively decommissioned; as such, containment efforts have been directed to the suppression of information relating to SCP-4659. A Foundation-operated bot (I/O-GATEWAY) has been put in place to extensively monitor online discussion boards and flag possible descriptions of SCP-4659-1 instances or SCP-4659-2. An MTF unit is to evaluate these claims and determine by a case-by-case basis whether the issuing of amnestics is necessary.

**Description:** SCP-4659 refers to a series of videos which periodically manifested on the hardwares of various computers over an approximate period of 05/15/2005 and 06/27/2005. These videos, individually designated SCP-4659-1-1 through -12, manifested on an estimated 15 computers per video, and all appear to be operated and produced by one individual, hereafter designated SCP-4659-2.

SCP-4659-2 is a vaguely humanoid entity which appears to reside in an extradimensional location currently unknown to the Foundation. Though it appears not to possess any means for visual observation, SCP-4659-2 demonstrates an ability to see, and instead of individual digits, SCP-4659-2 possesses seven small tendrils. Notably, SCP-4659-2 completely lacks facial features, save for a large, black spheroid structure in the middle of its face, which it vibrates to mimic the sound of human speech[[footnote]]Though its main language appears to be a guttural language as-of-yet undeciphered to the Foundation, SCP-4659-2 is also fluent in English.[[/footnote]].

The structure of most SCP-4659-1 instances[[footnote]]At times, SCP-4659-2 will produce an unstructured video addressing certain events in its life.[[/footnote]] follow the typical format of an online film review. At the beginning of each of these videos, SCP-4659-2 will shortly introduce the film[[footnote]]Notably, none of the films reviewed by SCP-4659-2 have corresponded to any films in our world.[[/footnote]] that it will be reviewing, usually in an exaggerated manner. For the middle portion of the video, footage of the film in question will be interspersed with various comments made by SCP-4659-2 about the film, typically for comedic effect. This middle portion continues for an average of 5-6 minutes, after which SCP-4659-2 will summarize its opinion of the film before ending the video with a plea to continue watching its content along with a link to its email for future video suggestions[[footnote]]Email since discontinued.[[/footnote]], the only known means of communication with SCP-4659-2.

**Proposal:** At its current pace, SCP-4659 poses an eminent threat to the Foundation's veil of secrecy. The proliferation of SCP-4659-1 instances appears to be growing exponentially, and while the Foundation has been able to suppress much of the information about SCP-4659 both on- and off-line, the current growth trends signify an increasing difficulty of containment efforts and a possible lifting of the veil.

The problems posed by SCP-4659 are twofold:

# Unlike other anomalies which proliferate on the Internet, SCP-4659 directly manifests onto hardware, which does not easily register to Foundation webcrawlers or bots. While numerous computer models are able to have their hardware monitored by the Foundation (including IBM, Dell, and Apple), the growing variety of computer models leaves SCP-4659 vulnerable to discovery, and in some cases, spreading. In fact, current models estimate that 2-3% of all SCP-4659-1 instances are discovered without Foundation intervention. Combined with the possibility that dissemination of SCP-4659 can extend beyond hardware (as evidenced by a radio station in Willoughby, OH being intercepted to play the audio of an SCP-4659-1 instance), containment of SCP-4659 will soon become near-impossible.
# Unlike other anomalies broadcasted from extradimensional locations, the amount of production value which would have to go into fabricating SCP-4659 is close to unbelievable. Even if it were simpler to explain the content of SCP-4659-1 instances away as parody or satire, the method by which SCP-4659-1 instances are disseminated is difficult to easily justify.

As attempting to contain SCP-4659 in the two approaches explained above is proving to be sharply decreasing in expediency, we are therefore proposing that SCP-4659 be considered for decommissioning.

**Method(s):** In order to discourage the further production of SCP-4659-1 instances, we are proposing to attempt direct contact with SCP-4659-2 via its provided business email (which has since been deactivated to non-Foundation personnel) in order to convince it to terminate the creation of SCP-4659. Along with the execution of current containment procedures, planned course of action is as follows:

# Demand the forced discontinuation of the production of SCP-4659-1 instances to SCP-4659-2 under the guise of:
 * Profane and obscene content
 * Copyright infringement
 * Harassment
# Should SCP-4659-2 be unwilling to comply with these requests, manufacture negative reception of SCP-4659 in emails directed towards SCP-4659-2.

Our hopes are that this protocol will dissuade SCP-4659-2 from making new SCP-4659-1 instances due to an overwhelmingly negative reception. Further methods are to be discussed should either of these methods fail in the discontinuation of SCP-4659 production.

----
**Proposal:** While the current decommissioning efforts have managed to maintain contact with SCP-4659-2, the measures that have been taken have only led to an increase in the production and proliferation of SCP-4659-1 instances. SCP-4659-2 has demonstrated hostility to the advances the Foundation made in order to convince it to cease SCP-4659 production, dismissing the initiated comments as being unfounded and useless, and in apparent spite towards the Foundation's efforts, SCP-4659-2 has apparently accelerated the production of new SCP-4659 instances. It is apparent that the current efforts put in place have significantly exacerbated efforts of containment; therefore, we are proposing several revisions to the decommissioning protocol.

**Method(s):** Given that SCP-4659-2 has been invariably hostile to any directly negative feedback, and given that SCP-4659-2 has at numerous times asked for constructive criticism of SCP-4659 from its followers, we therefore propose the following course of action:

# While posing as followers of SCP-4659, offer faulty advice to SCP-4659-2 about how it can improve future SCP-4659-1 instances. Current proposals for advice center around components which are more difficult to fulfill, such as:
 * Producing longer videos
 * Including more visual aids
 * Utilizing more props and clothing
# While still under the guise of SCP-4659 followers, issue negative feedback about the newly produced SCP-4659-1 instances.

Our hopes for this new protocol are that, in discovering the adverse appraisal from its supposed followers, SCP-4659-2 will become dissatisfied in making newer SCP-4659-1 instances due to its negative reception.

Hey all,

I think it's time to tell you something I've been wanting to say for a long time - I'm quitting this. It seems like when I put out something I've been spending days on end working on, you people just take a look at it and laugh. And you know what? Fuck it. I don't want to deal with this anymore. If you want the show back, like it seems all of you do, feel free to take those concerns and shove them up your excrement-filled anuses. Oh wait, is that too "obscene" for you? Fuck off, goodbye.
