**Item #:** SCP-TTKU-J

**Object Class:** Keter, because it can and will kill you

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-TTKU-J is contained in a reinforced standard containment cell at Area-0000 - far away from you, whom it wants to kill. Due to the fact that SCP-TTKU-J is a very dangerous thing that desires to and has the means to kill you, SCP-TTKU-J is to not be handled by you specifically. This containment method would render you effectively immortal as far as SCP-TTKU-J's killing-you objective is concerned.

**Description:** SCP-TTKU-J is a thing that kills you. Though murder is an illegal action in every national jurisdiction on Earth, condemned in most religious scriptures, and generally looked down upon, SCP-TTKU-J as an entity has no regard for any rule against killing you and has the means to do so in multiple ways - including, but not limited to:
* Use of a weapon to kill you,
* Use of a torture device to torture you, then kill you,
* Use of its own bare [REDACTED]s to kill you,
* Enlisting the aid of different thing that kills you as a means to kill you,
* Killing you until you have died,
* --Giving you a hug-- use of anomalous means to kill you, and
* [DATA EXPUNGED] ██ ████ you.

In the event of a total containment breach of SCP-TTKU-J, the inevitable result would be a URK-class you-are-about-to-be-killed event, followed by a UHK-class you-have-been-killed scenario. As you are, presumably, a thing that should not be killed, the latter scenario is to be avoided at all costs.
