**Item #:** SCP-TTKU-J

**Object Class:** Keter, because it can and will kill you

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-TTKU-J is contained in a reinforced standard containment cell at Area-0000 - far away from you, whom it wants to kill. Due to the fact that SCP-TTKU-J is a very dangerous thing that desires to and has the means to kill you, SCP-TTKU-J is to not be handled by you specifically. This containment method would render you effectively immortal as far as SCP-TTKU-J's killing-you objective is concerned.

**Description:** SCP-TTKU-J is a thing that kills you. Though murder is an illegal action in every national jurisdiction on Earth, condemned in most religious scriptures, and generally looked down upon, SCP-TTKU-J as an entity has no regard for any rule against killing you and has the means to do so in multiple ways - including, but not limited to:
* Use of a weapon to kill you,
* Use of a torture device to torture you, then kill you,
* Use of its own bare [REDACTED]s to kill you,
* Enlisting the aid of different thing that kills you as a means to kill you,
* Killing you until your life functions cease, then continuing to kill you,
* --Giving you a hug-- use of anomalous means to kill you, and
* [DATA EXPUNGED] ██ ████ you.

In the event of a total containment breach of SCP-TTKU-J, the inevitable result would be a URK-class you-are-about-to-be-killed event, followed by a UHK-class you-have-been-killed scenario. As you are, presumably, a thing that should not be killed, the latter scenario is to be avoided at all costs.

**Addendum 1 - Interview with SCP-TTKU-J, 2/23/15:**
> **Dr. Henderson:** Good morning, SCP-TTKU-J, I hope you're doing well.
> 
> **SCP-TTKU-J:** Eh, could be better. Right now, all I can think about is how much I want to kill you in many different ways.
> 
> **Dr. Henderson:** You know we can't allow you to do that.
> 
> **SCP-TTKU-J:** I figured as much. Still, it would be very nice if you'd let me stick a shiv into your ribcage right this very minute, until your heart stops. 
> 
> **Dr. Henderson:** Believe me, I've felt the same way many times.
> 
> **SCP-TTKU-J:** About yourself?
> 
> **Dr. Henderson:** Not quite.
> 
> **SCP-TTKU-J:** Man, I could go for some good ol'-fashioned you-murder right about now.
> 
> **Dr. Henderson:** Isn't there anything else you think about?
> 
> //(Brief pause)//
> 
> **SCP-TTKU-J:** I want to take up knitting.
> 
> **Dr. Henderson:** That's harmless enough.
> 
> **SCP-TTKU-J:** Because I could lure you into a false sense of security, then, when you least expect it, BAM! One knitting needle in each eye, as I tear out your heart with my teeth!
> 
> **Dr. Henderson:** This conversation is going nowhere.
> 
> **SCP-TTKU-J:** Obviously not! We haven't murdered you yet!
> 
> **Dr. Henderson:** If you hypothetically could kill me, what do you intend to do afterwards?
>  
> **SCP-TTKU-J:** Hmm... I kinda want to start a grindcore outfit.
> 
> **Dr. Henderson:** What would it be called?
> 
> **SCP-TTKU-J:** "Pile of Dead You."
> 
> **Dr. Henderson:** ...we're done here.

**Addendum 2 - Interview 2/24/15:**
> **Dr. Henderson:** Hello again. Please do not kill me.
> 
> **SCP-TTKU-J:** I make no promises there, buddy.
>

> 
> //(SCP-TTKU-J pauses in thought)//
> 
> **SCP-TTKU-J:** Well, there's always that "%%title%%" asshole.
