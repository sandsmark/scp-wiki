**Item #:** SCP-936

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Specimens of SCP-936 are to be kept on the grounds of Bio Research Site-104, enclosed by a fence to prevent unauthorised access, and watered daily.  Approximately once a month, the plantation is to be screened for any SCP-936-1 by two (2) D-Class personnel of adequate physical ability and SCP-936-1 are to be harvested according to site plan.
  Harvested SCP-936-2 --are to be incinerated-- if unused, can be fed to contained carnivores upon removal of seeds, which are to be incinerated. 
Following Incident 936-1, the D-class personnel performing the screening are to be screened thoroughly for infectious diseases, and are to use sterile gloves and facial filters  to prevent contamination.

Uncontained SCP-936 instances are to be dug out and any SCP-936-1 and SCP-936-2 incinerated.  For purposes of containment, the Foundation is to ensure SCP-936 is declared an invasive species. 


**Description:** SCP-936 is a species of deciduous, self-pollinating tree resembling //Fagus sylvatica//, inhabiting the region of northern and eastern Europe, most notably clustering around ██████, Ukraine. SCP-936 is capable of forming clonal colonies, the ol[DATA EXPUNGED].
It has been shown that the roots of SCP-936 are host to nitrogen-fixing bacteria, similarly to the legumes - as during most of its lifecycle, the plant doesn't display anomalous properties, checking for unusual soil nitration levels shows promise as an identification method.
SCP-936 is monoecious, and during flowering, specimens can be recognised by an unusually high male to female flower ratio - there are only several dozen female flowers, usually growing directly on older wood.  Out of those, on average, less than six continue development, and it is rare for more than a single fruit to reach maturity.
The resulting fruit, classified SCP-936-1 is covered in a  green cupule, and rapidly grows towards its ripe mass of app. 85 kg; SCP-936's foliage grows denser in order to cover for the energetic expenditure. Dissection has revealed the inside of  SCP-936-1 contains a length of stem wrapping around a structure closely resembling a human body, designated SCP-936-2. Tissue samples obtained from SCP-936-1 physiologically resemble human tissue, possessing functionality in most aspects [[footnote]] Notably, circulatory system appears fully functional, and fMRI  shows cerebral activity resembling that of an individual submerged in a sensory deprivation tank. [[/footnote]]  ,  with the exception of ██████, █████ and ███████ █████  which contain a mass of brown-black seeds approximately 3cm in diameter. 
As SCP-936-1 reaches maturity , the stem thickens considerably and the cupule wilts, eventually breaking, and causing SCP-936-2 to descend, hanging from the stem which in most cases wraps around its cervical region.
The appearance of SCP-936-2 produced by a single SCP-936 varies  in size, visual appearance and apparent gender with no discernible pattern.
The seeds within SCP-936-2 have a thick skin, and take approximately sixteen months to germinate.  However if exposed to an acidic enviroment (pH < 2),  germination occurs within ██ weeks.

**Recovery Log** SCP-936 was first discovered near ██████, Finland, after reports of an unusually high reported suicide rate. Intelligence agent ████ 's report has revealed this to be due to the statistics including  a number of nude hanging victims being periodically discovered on trees in the nearby ████ forest, and the local cemetery, their identity being impossible to determine.
Suspecting a cognitohazard, a  perimeter was estabilished around said yard under the premise of widespread bark beetle infection, and the site was placed under observation.
During observation period,  new corpse discovered despite security footage showing no violations of perimeter within  assumed time of death and autopsy revealed anomalies inconsistent with human anatomy, notably, seeds located in [REDACTED]. Agent F████ noted that all victims have been found hanging from a single species of tree, and a thorough examination has resulted in the procurement several samples of unripe  SCP-936-1 , leading to SCP-936 classification.
MTF Xi-8 "Spearhunters" performed removal of all instances of SCP-936 within an surrounding area of 45 km sq.  Obtained seeds contained at Bio Research Site-104.

**Addendum 936-1:**  
> **EXPERIMENT LOG SCP-936**
> 
> **SUBJECT:** D-532, 25 year old male.
> **GRAFT:** 100 cm sq. of  skin taken from SCP-936-2.
> **RESULT:** Skin graft implanted successfully. Skin shows higher mechanical resistance, possibly due to interstitial cellulose fibers. However, incisions take longer to heal, and poor resistance to UV light.
> 
> **SUBJECT:** D-532, 25 year old male.
> **GRAFT:** muscular tissue taken from biceps of SCP-936-2.
> **RESULT:** Muscle graft implanted successfully. Muscular tissue appears to behave ordinarily, and has similar strength/volume ratio.Despite D-821 being restrained for several days due to operation , implanted muscle showed no traces of atrophy.  Subject D-821's diet switched to protein-deficient - measurements of rate of muscle loss showed this to be lower by a factor of  ██.
> 
> **SUBJECT:** D-231, 30 year old male.
> **GRAFT:** Kidneys taken from SCP-936-2.
> **RESULT:** Graft implanted successfully. Kidneys shown to have remarkable liquid economy.  Subject expired due to renal failure after seven weeks. 
> 
> **SUBJECT:** D-512, 23 year old female.
> **GRAFT:**  Digestive system taken from SCP-936-2.
> **RESULT:** Graft implanted successfully. D-532, instead of via regular digestion, appears to absorb products of bacterial decay - intestinal microflora changed substantially.  D-532 appears emaciated. D-532's urine abnormal - further testing shows intestinal flora removes cca.██% of urea from her bloodstream and reprocesses it.
> //I suspect the new intestinal tract isn't long enough for this mode of digestion. - Dr  ██████//
> 
> **SUBJECT:** D-721, 25 year old female.
> **GRAFT:** [REDACTED]
> **RESULT:** Graft implanted successfully. D-721 appears to produce a steady supply of seeds.
>  
> **SUBJECT:** D-723, 31 year old female.
> **GRAFT:** Subject impregnated with sperm harvested from SCP-936-1.
> **RESULT:** Pregnancy appears to progress normally, however after ██ weeks, ultrasound reading [DATA EXPUNGED]01. Foetus artificially aborted. 
> //Note: This might explain why man[DATA EXPUNGED] - Dr. Eisenberg//

**Addendum 936-2:** 
> Incident 936-1:
>  On ██/██/19██ , one of the D-class personnel tasked with SCP-936-1 harvest, later shown suffering from a  //rhinovirus// infection,  transmitted the virus onto at least one SCP-936-1. The infection spread through as of yet unknown means, causing a crop failure  SCP-936 , heavily delaying research progress. Removal of infected/dead SCP-936-1 successful in halting infection progress.
