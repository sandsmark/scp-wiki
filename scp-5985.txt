**Special Containment Procedures:** MTF Omega-1 ("Zen Eternal") agents have been assigned to guard the vicinity of the temple disguised as Cultural Preservation Troops. As of **Incident Firechild** (refer to Discovery Log), only individuals with Level 4 Clearance or above are allowed entrance. 

Any physical contact with SCP-5985 is strictly forbidden outside of experimentation. Noise-cancelling headphones are to be equipped when within the monks' 20m zone of influence, and they are to be observed periodically for any signs of irregularity or abnormality. Any detectable change in respiratory rate, muscle movement, immobility, and behavior, is to be reported immediately to Dr. Damien, Dr. Vidyarthi, or any available Level 4 researcher.

For now, communication with SCP-5985-1 is restricted to Dr. Vidyarthi. No one beyond Dr. Vidyarthi is cleared to assume communication procedures. A maximum of four personnel are to be assigned as security during communication with.

In the event that the Dr. Vidyarthi is likely to enter the critical stages of transmigration with SCP-5985, he is to be uninterrupted. Additional personnel present are to observe and record Dr. Vidyarthi's physical state without interfering.

**Description:** SCP-5985 is a body of fluid, resting in a 5 x 8 meter oval pool, situated within the ██████ Temple, a Buddhist enclosure 64km away from Kathmandu, Nepal. The external appearance of SCP-5985 has no visual difference that could be discerned from any instance of water. Conversely, its chemical composition remains unknown, due to its adverse nature with experimentations. It maintains an unchanging internal temperature of 15°C. SCP-5985 maintains its liquid form, and does not react to boiling or freezing methods.[[footnote]]It has been known to be completely nonreactive to temperatures higher than the melting point of Tungsten, which has the highest melting point of all elements (3422 °C, 6192 °F).[[/footnote]].

Efforts to remove any amount of SCP-5985 from the pool have failed. Samples of SCP-5985 recede back to the pool when they are carried 20 meters away from their source. An instance of SCP-5985 can phase through any material on its trajectory, until it reaches the pool. This instance of intangibility is observed to be nonhazardous. Thus, a mobile lab has been established for future tests.

SCP-5985 is surrounded by seven, octogenarian Buddhist monks meditating in a lotus pose, designated collectively as SCP-5985-A. They display no signs of consciousness or any reaction to outside stimuli.  Body scans of the monks have revealed that their organ systems are preserved well, displaying no signs of necroses. Their vague origins can be traced back to a surviving esoteric document, estimating their ages to be roughly 5██ years or older. Presently, no possible method or tool are able to penetrate their skin.

SCP-5985-1 is identified as the consciousness of SCP-5985, describing itself as “the blood of the Earth”, “the life-force of the Earth”. It manifests when SCP-5985 is ingested, assuming the form of a voice within the drinker[[footnote]]SCP-5985-1 does not manifest in animals. Although, SCP-5985-1 can weakly communicate with chimpanzees. This could be in relation to its cerebral functions being similar to humans. A study to test SCP-5985-1 with octopi is under evaluation.[[/footnote]]. SCP-5985-1 has no distinctive name. It is capable of speaking in any recorded language simultaneously. The true nature of SCP-5985-1 remains unknown due to lack of authentic, historical information on it. SCP-5985-1 has been noted to possess vast intelligence and the ability to assimilate any information from the drinker. 

SCP-5985-1 can utilize SCP-5985-A as conduits through which it calls individuals towards the pool. The process behind this, and the range of its influence, are still under investigation. The vocalizations emitted by SCP-5985-A, in the form of chanting, have audiohazardous effects that can be insidious or mild, depending on the subject. Although, emotional state has been found to increase susceptibility to these audiohazards. Affected Individuals have expressed a "strong urge to drink from the pool". This was the onset of **Incident Firechild**.

Dr. Damien has stated that the SCP-5985-1 is highly reactive to the emotional response of the drinker. A low to zero brain activity is required to be maintained continually to strengthen communication with SCP-5985-1; SCP-5985-1 exerts great stress on cerebral functions; any sudden emotional change can have devastating outcomes[[footnote]]This explains the longevity the //khenchens// enjoyed. Their meditation practices were effective in reducing brain activity without complications. - //Dr. Damien//[[/footnote]]. A successful connection with SCP-5985-1 allows the temporary distribution of its anomalous properties to the drinker. Thus, the union of the drinker and SCP-5985-1 is designated as SCP-5985-2.

Instances of an unstable connection can result to large-scale catastrophic events lasting for a short duration, endangering people and objects around it, ultimately ending the connection. The drinker will then undergo liquefaction into a perfect amalgam of SCP-5985 with all its properties. Dr. Damien has termed this as the //Critical Point//.



**Discovery Log - //Incident Firechild//:** On ██/██/2020, the Foundation received an urgent notice from the [REDACTED] branch of the Nepalese Government transmitted to their CF-Networks. It was concerning about a possible, large-scale anomaly that occurred approximately three hours before, and attached to it were encrypted surveillance videos providing a summary of the incident.

As an immediate response, Chief Field Agents "O” Ogami and "D" Daigoro were deployed to handle the investigation of the anomaly in question. Their first lead was the hospital in which the child, currently in a semi-comatose state, was transferred to. Their first priority before assessing the child was to question the surviving witnesses of the incident. The witnesses described the child as "//possessed by an angry spirit//", and others witnessed the child "//crying with tears of fire//". Further descriptions remarked that the child walked around screaming "//I hate my father!//" without cessation. After administering Class A amnestics to the witnesses, Agents O and D proceeded to investigate the child and the possibility of an SCP Protocol.

When they arrived to assess the child, identified as A███ X█████, they were met with a boy of ten years old, suffering from fourth-degree burns on a whole-body scale. Agent O began his audio-recorded examination of the child, while Agent D began questioning the staff who were handling the patient at present. The body of the boy was damaged to the point of charring and disfiguration. Certain skeletal parts were recognizably jutting out of the skin. Although, complete neurotmesis of the body did not clarify the semi-comatose condition of the child; cardiac muscles were barely functioning to provide blood supplies to essential organs, specifically the lungs. Nevertheless, the child was able to breathe albeit strained. The child was mumbling softly, despite his crippled situation. Twenty seconds later in the middle of Agent O's examination, the child opened his eyes and regained consciousness. Agent O initiated communication:

> //Agent Daigo is heard entering the room.//
> 
> **Agent D:** Shit. Oggy stay sharp. You read the reports. This guy could blow us up next.
> 
> **Agent O:** Calm down. Observe his body. It's... healing.

> 
> **Agent O:** I know. A███ X█████? Is that your name? I need you to calm down for me. Your mommy and daddy, what happened to them?
> 
> **A███ X█████**: (//Sobbing uncontrollably//)  I-I don't know... I-I was angry. I-I think.. I think I hurt daddy. Mommy w-was... crying...

> **Agent D**: Mother and father are both dead. Both burned to death.
> 
> **Agent O**: (//Whispers back//) This is unholy. 
> 
> **Agent O**: A███, try to breathe, and relax. Tell me what happened. Can you remember anything? Breathe in, and breathe out.
> 
> **A███ X█████**: (//sobbing//) ...angry. I-I killed them. I killed mommy. I killed... I killed daddy (//continued sobbing//). I-I **BURNED THEM**. (//Voice grows hoarse and deep//) **HE WAS ALWAYS BAD. BAD TO ME.** I **HATED** daddy. **I HATED**-

> 
> **Agent D**: Done. That confirms it.
> 
> **Agent O**: The boy is not the main source of the anomaly. That leaves us with the only lead-- the temple. That place should hopefully give us some clues.
> 
> **Agent D**: Well-- how about him? Not the most reasonable idea to leave the boy like... that.
> 
> **Agent O**: Bad luck for him. Killed his parents and all that. We'll let the latecomers deal with it. (//Agent O notices himself stepping on water//) Wait... why is there liquid all around the...

Agents Ogami and Daigoro pursued the liquid mass, which was hovering above and through a number of buildings and propelling itself at a speed of 12km/s. The flight path of the liquid mass led the Foundation to the eventual discovery of the ██████ Temple, 10km away north from the hospital. Agents Ogami and Daigoro followed the liquid mass on foot, nonstop.

They were able to follow the liquid mass drift into the temple. Inside, Agents Ogami and Daigoro stepped before a temple pool. The pool itself is at the center of the temple. Around the pool were a circle of seven monks, nonresponsive to the agents’ intrusion into their meditation. Agent O approached the pool closer in order the study the structure. In the pool was a body of water, inhabited by several lotus flowers.  Both of the agents reasoned that this was the source of the anomaly due its temperature-- it was -2 °C outside, but the water's temperature did not fall or rise out of 15 °C. Afterwards, as they were about to call again the Foundation to inspect the source, they were greeted by the head monk. Agent O has video recorded the interaction, as usual:

[[collapsible show="Access Incident Firechild-002" hide="Close Incident Firechild-002"]]
> //The head monk is a Nepalese male, around eighty-five years old. Agent O approached the head monk to tell him in Nepalese to leave the premises for his safety. Agent Ogami’s portable video recorder was active to document this event.//
> 
> **//Khenchen//**: //Tashi Delek// to you, brethren of the path. I am the //khenchen// of this humble monastery… and I cannot seem to fathom why you both need to lie.
> 
> **Agent D**: This is no joking matter, sir. A child just died an hour ago because of this water. 
> 
> **//Khenchen//**: Ah… forgive my impoliteness. (//Exhales//) It is just human of me. Pardon my ignorance about this, but I have no time. I must show you both something. Cover your ears.
> 
> //The khenchen passes by Agent Daigoro, heading into the pool.//
> 
> **Agent O**: You let him pass.
> 
> **Agent D**: Wh—Hey, mister, wait a minute! Don’t let me whip this out! (//unholsters his stun gun//)
> 
> //The seven monks around the pool begin to chant. There is a slight degradation in the video quality. Agents Daigoro visibly winces and stops in his tracks. The chanting increases in volume.//
> 
> **Agent O**: Daigoro… you hear… that? The monks are chanting!
> 
> **Agent D**: The monks… they’re getting young—what the fuck is this?
> 
> //Both of the Agents are pressured by the chanting to sit down. They seemed to be inflicted with a strong headache.//
> 
> **Khenchen**: (//Speaking in English//) I told you both to cover your ears. Cover them now! If you do not, you will feel thirsty, the waters will look tempting, and you will both turn into monsters of your own making!
> 
> //Both of the agents complied without hesitation. The khenchen is unaffected by the chanting.//
> 
> **Agent D**: He’s… speaking in English? What… the fuck… 
> 
> **Khenchen**: That is the least you can do. For now, let me… explain this to our Teacher.
> 
> //The khenchen can be seen cupping the water from the pool and drinking it. He then sits on the edge of the pool, and assumes a meditative position. He can be heard talking in Nepalese. Simultaneously, a deep-pitched, hoarse voice can be heard coming from him. The voice replies in Nepalese, although, it is barely audible, due to its disruptive effect to the audio. After forty-five seconds, the chanting stopped.//
> 
> **Khenchen**: (//Facing both the agents//) That… will be the last. I am already too old. For this. Do I look old to you, young men?
> 
> **Agent D**: (//Breathing heavily//) Old man… I did not like the trick you just pulled. Why the fuck did you become young?
> 
> **Agent O**: I saw you… drinking that water. I heard… you talking with it…
> 
> **Khenchen**: Years ago, we could to speak with the Teacher like I would speak with you. Time has passed by. Things become weak… or humans became weaker. Now to communicate to the Teacher, we have to drink it. (//Grumbles//) You two are not from the Nepalese government, are you?
> 
> **Agent O**: (//Heavy breathing//) Why… would you ask?
> 
> **Khenchen**: Just making sure. They were the ones who put those cameras up (//Points to cameras fixed on the behind Agent Ogami//). They always had their eyes set upon this water, thinking they could exploit its power. Many lives here were disturbed forever. Our peaceful lives, of simplicity, were gone. The secret our predecessors have given to us was just a hair’s length of being seized from us.
> 
> **Agent D**: Ogami, are you piecing of all this shit together? A secret? You’ve been keeping this a secret?
> 
> **Khenchen**: That boy wasn’t the first. There were many… (//sighs//) victims… before him. They thought the water was a cure. The fools thought there was power here, but it was power they could not understand. Even we did not understand it. Now we have those Nepalese quacks and their hidden eyes upon us. We only wanted a peaceful place.
> 
> **Agent O**: (//Standing up//) And now, you’re in a predicament. Now tell us, what just happened there? Why did the monks behind you become young? What did that water do to you? (//To Agent D//) Daigoro, on your feet.
> 
> **Khenchen**: Patience. What you just had experienced was the power of the seven monks. Long ago, this power was pivotal in defending this sacred temple. It reflected back the wrongdoings of a person against him, in the form of flameless fire. Heh, seeing you too writhing there like snakes… I guess you both have done things, hm? 
> 
> **Agent D**: Ogami, permission to apprehend this fucker immediately.
> 
> **Agent O**: Control yourself, Daigoro. We are in the wolf’s den here. We’re still not sure what tricks he has left in his sleeves.
> 
> **Khenchen**: (//Sighs deeply//) "Up" my sleeves. I assure you I am no trickster. I am telling you both the truth. (//The khenchen rolls his right sleeve to reveal a golden watch//) Huh, the time is nigh.
> 
> //The khenchen’s physical features were slowly regaining its senile details.//
> 
> **Agent O**: Your skin... you are returning back to your old form.
> 
> **Khenchen**: No, brethren. I am on the path to another cycle.
> 
> **Agent D**: Cycle? You’re not going anywhere. You have a lot to explain.
> 
> **Khenchen**: I know what your plans are. They have been revealed to me in a blurry vision. You are fingers from a hand fidgeting the unknown. You are toes from a foot that have forgotten the earth that you walk upon. (//The khenchen turns his head to look at the pool//) And now, you have come to take our Teacher.
> 
> **Agent O**: (//Approaching the khenchen slowly. The khenchen remains sitting down on the edge of the pool//) Come on, old man. Make some sense. Who’s this teacher you’re talking about?
> 
> **Khenchen**: The Teacher is our protector, our guide, and our sage. To communicate with him, we uphold the tenets of meditation. Our Teacher has, for so long, desired to give peace to ailing spirits, but he is a life-force too great for the ordinary man. That is why we are here—to protect this secret from the public, for their safety. But as you can see—I have failed. The service of //khenchens// are over.
> 
> **Agent D**: Your Teacher killed a child and his family for “peace”.
> 
> **Khenchen**: Human emotions are too profound for him to conquer. Only the monks have the endurance to speak with the Teacher. Perhaps, it is because we have renounced the material, the physical, and sharpened ourselves with the spiritual.
> 
> **Agent O**: MTF Epsilon-8, do you copy? This is Ogami. We request your presence here ASAP. There is possibility of an anomaly with... dangerous capabilities. Be advised.
> 
> **Khenchen**: (//Looks at his watch//) There will be a rainstorm in exactly... a minute. When the first sound of thunder comes, I will be off to my new cycle, my new path.
> 
> **Agent D**: You stay where you are, monk. You’re not gonna pull out anymore fucking tricks. I need to get some proper explanation from you.
> 
> **Khenchen**: This is not the temple to send curses, Agent Daigoro, son of [DATA REDACTED].
> 
> **Agent D**: Why do you know my father and mother? (//Prepares to seize the khenchen by the garment, but is stopped by Agent Ogami//)
> 
> **Agent O**: How did you know his family? Who told you of us? That’s classified information.
> 
> **Khenchen**: I told you I have seen you in a blurry vision. This is but one of the wisdoms our teacher has granted us. Heh. How do you think a simple monk can suddenly confabulate in English?
> 
> **Agent D**: Tell me... who is this teacher, you prick?
> 
> **Khenchen**: **Surrender your mind to the universe. Erase your anger. Let //Buddha// be your guide, then drink the water, and the Teacher. Shall. Speak.**
> 
> **Agent D**: Shit, it's the same voice back then!
> 
> **Agent O**: Hold your ground. Get your firearm out!
> 
> //There is a sudden flash of lighting that can be heard in the background.//
> 
> **Khenchen**: Ah, the thunder. I prayed to the universe for this alignment. Away to the next path.
> 
> **Agent O**: His body... its turning to water. Daigoro, back away!
> 
> //The khenchen’s body gradually “melts” into liquid, starting from the eye. He does not move from his position. The liquified part flow into the pool.//
> 
> **Khenchen**: Brothers, it is not an accident that we had this conversation. I guess I left both of you more confused (//the khenchen laughs//). Let it stay that way. Do not worry. From you there will be—
> 
> //Video ends as Agent Ogami’s video recorder ran out of battery. It was never known what the monk’s last words were, either. Agents Ogami and Daigoro were not able to hear it due to the sound of thunder arriving as the khenchen’s whole body completed liquefaction, and flowed into the pool.//

MTF Epsilon-8 arrived later after this incident. Agent Ogami and Daigoro were recovered, of sound health and mind. They were sent back for debriefing and psychological evaluation. The temple was secured, and a perimeter was quickly constructed around it. The Nepalese Government demanded the rights to acquire the temple under their authority. O5 sent Mr. [REDACTED] to arbitrate the dispute, and afterwards they receded their request post-haste. Consequently, all video surveillance cameras that were covertly installed in the temple, by the Nepalese Government, were removed. MTF Epsilon-8 were replaced by Omega-1.

The identity of the //khenchen// was confirmed as [REDACTED]. There are no surviving members of his family. His father was a renowned horologist in Kathmandu, and operated a repair shop before his death.  His mother served as a custodian for the temple. 

The preliminary reports were still incomplete; much more of the anomaly was unexplained. It was not conclusive at that time if the water and the vocal entity were two separate beings. The Foundation initiated a high-priority declassification of the anomaly in question. O5 recommended Senior Researcher Dr. Damien to spearhead the operation. However, Agents Ogami and Daigoro both forwarded their recommendation for Dr. Vidyarthi, who was well-known in the field for his expertise in religion-connected anomalies, especially Buddhism. Both parties reached a consensus: to place both senior researchers in a joint operation. Thus, Dr. Damien and Dr. Vidyarthi began their work on the Waters of Wisdom, then known as SCP-5985.

**Addendum SCP-XXXX-01: Declassification Log – //SCP-5985-1//:** The researchers extrapolated that ingesting the water was the only way of communication with the entity. Based also from historic texts the temple library provided them, there is esoteric information describing the water as the “heart of the world”, which is a close allusion to the Anavatapta, a mythical lake in the center of the world.  

The monks protected the water from the public eye, employing the prophetic tradition of //khenchens//, who were able to communicate with the water by the use of deep meditation. This succession lasted for centuries, and the coming of a new //khenchen// ultimately meant the end of the previous //khenchen//. The seven monks around the pool, however, are still unknown in origin.

Dr. Vidyarthi volunteered to perform meditation rites as an attempt to communicate with the anomaly. There were aversions to this method, specifically from the Ethics Committee, preferring the use of D-class personnel to test the the waters first. Dr. Vidyarthi disliked this suggestion, emphasizing that there was sufficient information to safely ingest the fluid, and the use of D-class was unnecessary waste of life.  Additionally, Dr. Damien agreed with Dr. Vidyarthi that this is the only manner to prove, or disprove the hypotheses, and it has to be executed in a pragmatic manner. Certain protocols were followed to ensure that an instance of **Incident Firechild** did not repeat.

> **Dr. Damien**: ...and so based on **our** collective insight, I can absolutely say, without fault, that the key to maintaining a stable connection with this... anomaly, is to be calm, composed, like a breath in the-- (//clears throat//) you've watched that same clip a total of three times, now.

> **Dr. Vidyarthi**: I am studying the //khenchen's// body posture, movement, breathing, and technique in meditation. Agent Ogami did a good job keeping his camera in motion.
> 
> **Dr. Damien**: Indeed. A master of the intricate you are, but to me, meditation is meditation.
> 
> **Dr. Vidyarthi**: The meditations these monks do would overwhelm our minds. A drop in mind clutter in a *snap* would make us go insane. That could explain why Oggy and Daigoro weren't able to handle that type of influence. "Weightlessness". As they said.
> 
> **Dr. Damien**: Huh, but isn't it the monks that made them weak in the bones? 
> 
> **Dr. Vidyarthi**: It is unusual. In both of the footage of the child and the monk, the seven monks were active. I think... they were reaching out to anyone who steps in here. But they haven't reached out to us.

> **Dr. Vidyarthi**: I have done it some, memorable times. It either works or works against me. It's a difficult position to hold. No one wants to be alone with their demons.

After two hours, Dr. Vidyarthi recovered from his semi-comatose state. His vital signs were normal, in spite of a heightened brain activity too abnormal for a human being, and excessive sweating. During the span of twenty-four hours, Dr. Vidyarthi was able to predict certain happenings in perfect detail that were about to take place in the future. Dr. Vidyarthi was able to delineate a number of situations that were to occur in various places across continents. A perfect instance was the results of the winnings of all casinos and gambling dens, legal and illegal. He laid down the situations, the processes, and the results verbatim. This was confirmed by [DATA EXPUNGED]. 

Dr. Vidyarthi's prognostic abilities was only one of the anomalous effects he acquired from ingesting the water. Any person he came in contact by physical touch, skin-to-skin, or direct eye-to-eye contact, triggered another anomaly. As he described it, he could "siphon" the past, present, and future memories of the individual. This exchange caused a great deal of stress on the affected individual for a brief period.

These anomalous qualities disappeared after a duration of twenty-four hours. It is not known if it is prolonged by the amount of water ingested. Dr. Vidyarthi was further tested for any persisting anomalous qualities. He remarked he was fine, and he wrote to the O5 Council to allow him to extend communications with the "life-force", as he said. Dr. Damien supported this decision once more. Since there was still a lack of definite answers to arrive to a conclusion, O5 approved further experimentation with the water.

> 
> **Dr. Vidyarthi**: It didn't take over me, but its presence was, was like bathing in cold water for so long, you can feel your breath in your lungs. I opened my eyes, and I found myself in a borderless, empty space, except for the ground which was water. And there was a voice. I think that's the life-force.

The red, hot blood that ruled the Earth had no equal, until…**
> 
> **SCP-5985-1**: **Until I ceased. I saw nothing good with it. That was the time I renounced the destruction I had wrought upon here. Now I know what to name it. Wrath and anger. Rage left my essence, and I was, as you see now. Blue.**
> 
> **Dr. Vidyarthi**: You sounded so grand back in those days. Why are you now just a puddle—a pool, I mean.
> 
> **SCP-5985-1**: **Time, Vidyarthi. Time has cut me off the rest of my parts. Even my foresight beyond the folds of Time has no benefit. What you see before you. Is all that is left. Of me.**
> 
> **Dr. Vidyarthi**: And… who are these monks around you? Where did they come from?
> 
> **SCP-5985-1**: **I have kept them safe, and they returned the gratitude by teaching me of your kind. They were monks fleeing from their barbarians. They only wished a place to find peace. In their escape, they stumbled upon me: a pond of water, they thought, on a crack in Earth. I heard their woes, so I revealed myself as voice, offering them power to defend themselves from their usurpers.**
> 
> **Dr. Vidyarthi**: (//Inhaling//) What power did you give them?
> 
> **SCP-5985-1**: **I told them to drink me, and I shall grant them a voice. When they speak in unison, it is a voice that cannot be silenced. So they agreed. And they drank. The day after, their enemies came, riding on steeds, yelling foul insults. The monks circled themselves around me, and began to use their voice in a chant. It was the first that I heard them… meditate.**
> 
> //The monks began chanting The Heart Sutra. Dr. Damien reminds the personnel to secure their noise-cancelling headphones properly.//
> 
> **SCP-5985-1**: **Their voice, as one, was an echoing scourge that left their oppressors paralyzed, shaking in pain. Invisible pain. Flameless fire. The monks saw what this power was capable of, so they pleaded to me to remove their sufferings. Their enemies’ suffering.**
> 
> //The monks stop chanting.//
> 
> **SCP-5985-1**: **Forgiveness. There was no flame for it, no color. I did not know what this forgiveness they spoke about. I told them why would they save their oppressors? Why not finish them? They said, “Without forgiveness, there will always be. Blood.” I did not understand, but I felt I did. I removed the pain from their oppressors. On their knees, they said their many apologies to the seven monks. In return, for this act of forgiveness, they agreed to the monks’ request: build a temple around me, where those who seek peace can come, and those who ail can find it.**
> 
> **SCP-5985-1**: **I told them, “who taught you of things like these?”. They replied, “It was the Buddha that taught us.”**
> 
> **Dr. Vidyarthi**: Was that a long time ago?
> 
> **SCP-5985-1**: **Yes. Indeed. That was before the //khenchens// where made my voice, the proliferators of my wisdom. From me they learned, from them I learned. Now, Vidyarthi, it seems that you are taking the toll of this union we are taking place in.**
> 
> **Dr. Vidyarthi**: (//Breathing heavily//) H-huh? What are you saying?
> 
> **SCP-5985-1**: **Look above you. The fires are starting to sink. Your lungs are tired. Your sweat has dehydrated you. We can continue this the next day. For now, I will grant you something temporary—your eyes imbued with my life-force. //Namaste!//**
> 
> **Dr. Vidyarthi**: No—wait!
> 
> //The entity of water gushed out of Dr. Vidyarthi’s mouth, ending the connection. Dr. Vidyarthi by the end was gasping for air, severely dehydrated, and disoriented with his surroundings. His vital signs were normal, nonetheless he required medical attention. Dr. Damien ordered the cessation of the operation.//
> 
> End video.
> 

After recovering from his debilitated condition, Dr. Vidyarthi did not exhibit the previous anomalous properties. Instead, he reported that he was could not visually perceive anything, except in colors. He could see a person in a spectral color, but not recognize one by physical appearance; he could not tell a person from one another due to their faces lacking obvious features.

Additionally, his auditory perception was magnified. His ear was extremely sensitive to sounds three meters away from him, and he had to be provided with noise-cancelling headphones to lessen the discomfort. He stated he could hear, in perfect silence, the clock in Dr. Damien's office ticking, which was 10 meters away from his office.

The drawback of the anomalous properties was Dr. Vidyarthi's vulnerability to quickly be fatigued, extreme dehydration, and constant sweating. He was on constant surveillance under Dr. Damien, who monitored his vital signs, and reported the findings to O5.

After a period of twenty-four hours, the anomalous properties disappeared, and Dr. Vidyarthi returned to his normal condition. Dr. Vidyarthi was sent for physical evaluation and debriefing. Afterwards, he formally requested another communication event with SCP-XXXX-1. Dr. Damien supported the request. O5 approved another communication with SCP-XXXX-1.

> **Dr. Vidyarthi**: I did not know what I was deciding for. Even if I had the answers, humanity will never be... ready.
> 
> **SCP-5985-1**: **A wisdom in you has grown, more precious than anything you can term... anomalous. Now. Vidyarthi. It is time for us to part again. You have lost your energy. And there are beholders growing weary of our talk.**
> 
> **Dr. Vidyarthi**: Beholders?.
> 
> **SCP-5985-1**: **Indeed. Vidyarthi. They are eyes beyond you. And beyond me. I can sense them, perusing this moment. Do. You sense them?**
> 
> **Dr. Vidyarthi**: What is this?
> 
> **SCP-5985-1**: **Of no importance to you. Of great importance to me. These are things I need to ponder upon. In my dreams. In the bedrock of Time. For now. We must part. Look at your sky. It has become cloudy.** 
> 
> **Dr. Vidyarthi**: Is it bad?
> 
> **SCP-5985-1**: **No. Vidyarthi. It portends that you are about to achieve boundless divinity in the next. Five seconds.**

> **Dr. Vidyarthi**: What?

> 
> **SCP-5985-1**: **Of course. Vidyarthi. It is. Another. Joke. You are the most intelligent species on Earth, but you did not know it was joke. Your claim to dominance. Is that scientific truth or arrogance? Matters aside. I have not seen a cloudy sky. This is a first.**

> **Dr. Vidyarthi**: ...there is no return from it.

> **SCP-5985-1**: **You are as wise as the //khenchens//, or even wiser than them. Perhaps, before we part, I shall disclose to you the secret burial chamber of... Buddha himself. As a gift.**

> 
> **Dr. Vidyarthi**: ...of Buddha? Siddhartha Gautama?
> 
> **SCP-5985-1**: **Do you speak in latitudes and longitudes? He is resting peacefully at [DATA EXPUNGED].**

> **Dr. Vidyarthi**: It seems I will be busy with a lot of things... to occupy my mind.
> 
> **SCP-5985-1**: **Indeed. There will be no. Anomaly. As your Foundation says. That will happen to you.  Vidyarthi. I have learned many things from you. I shall put them into meditation. For now.**
> 
> **Dr. Vidyarthi**: Meditation? You mean, you will not... talk to me?
> 
> **SCP-5985-1**:  **You have become attached. Vidyarthi. But you must know. You are still human. You remind your peers of that. I have been mixed with human affairs for eons, I believe I have forgotten. Myself. It is time for me. And you. To part for now.**
> 
> **Dr. Vidyarthi**: I will still communicate with you, if I can.
> 
> **SCP-5985-1**: **We will see. The exchange of words is over. Remember your choice. Vidyarthi. //Namaste!//**

Dr. Vidyarthi did not exhibit any anomalous properties after the operation, and forwarded a letter to O5 that he will be abstaining from communicating with SCP-XXXX-1 for a period of time.He was questioned about the matter SCP-5985-1 discussed during the Critical Point of the communication, but Dr. Vidyarthi stated he could not fully comprehend the whole event to give a proper interpretation. Dr. Vidyarthi remains the head of any communication with SCP-XXXX-1. Presently, communication with SCP-XXXX-1 has not been initiated again.

**Addendum SCP-XXXX-02**: On █/██/21 Dr. Damien led an expedition to the coordinates of the burial,  forty-five miles away from Bhutan, near the border of Tibet. A cave blocked by rock and ice was discovered, and the interior was a chamber resembling a //stupa//. In the middle of the chamber was a coffin. in the shape of a human. Dr. Damien opened the coffin, and found no corpse. There was only a scroll with a single line of writing in Sanskrit, which in English, roughly translates to:

> //"Vidyarthi. There is nobody here. You have been tricked."//

It is unknown if this message was written by SCP-5985-1, and whether it was written in the past or the present. Dr. Vidyarthi postulated that SCP-5985-1 indeed wrote it, perhaps it entered a state of forgetfulness, which is one of its properties. It is possible that SCP-5985-1 has already foreseen everything. O5 have strongly recommended a further study into this anomaly, but Dr. Vidyarthi has not taken any initiative to commence another communication[[footnote]]I believe, gentlemen, that SCP-5985-1 has learned of pranks. How could it possibly have learned this? By reading my mind from the future, getting amused by it, and then doing the little trick. Afterwards, it had forgotten everything from this part. That is just my hypothesis. //Namaste//. - Dr. Vidyarthi.[[/footnote]].
