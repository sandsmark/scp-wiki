**Item #:** SCP-001

**Object Class:** Maksur you get some groceries.

**Special Containment Procedures:** Information on the relevancy of SCP-001 to the related anomalous objects are to be omitted from the respective objects' documentation. 

All information related to SCP-001 is to be treated as a lethal DANIEL/RADCLIFFE class cognitohazard and supplied on a need to know basis. All personnel assigned to SCP-001 are to be amnesticised every three minutes to prevent knowledge of SCP-001's involvement in Foundation affairs being leaked. 

SCP-001 is to be kept in a 3x4x2x km aquatic specimen tank in Site 01. He is to be fed live fish, shrimp and crustaceans twice a day, but no disgusting blenny fish thank you very much. If blenny fish are provided, you will be stung.

On no occasion is SCP-001 to be let near a word processor or an XK Class Earth-shattering-kaboom event will occur. The O5 council wishes to prevent this by all means necessary, as they usually have tea at six together and they can't do that if their atoms are split.

**Description:** SCP-001 is a lame-ass author avatar masquerading as a //Synanceia verrucosa//. SCP-001 identifies himself as royalty, and as such wears a dainty-ass crown.

SCP-001 is a devious mastermind, and the ghostwriter behind such notable SCP writers as [[*user Dr. Gears]], [[*user theduckman]], [[*user djkaktus]], [[*user Roget]], [[*user Decibelles]], [[*user SunnyClockwork]] and others. It is speculated that [[*user DrClef]] works for him, and that Site Administrator [[*user thedeadlymoose]] is in fact a meat puppet controlled by him. It is estimated that SCP-001 has written up to 85% of the total SCP Wiki and has shaped its direction since giving [[*user Moto42]] some friendly advice about Japanese statuary way back in 2006. [DATA REDACTED DUE TO META WANKERY] Recently SCP-001 has decided to write articles under his own name, with mixed results. 

He has currently written:

* [[[SCP-2714]]] - ("Billions of Blue Blistering"), a minor entry in the Sarkic canon. It's about Tintin, because SCP-001 is nerdy and feels the world needs more Tintin. Received mixed reviews.
* [[[SCP-2432]]] - ("Room Service"), A horror story that uses cliche "ominous broken english", cliche body horror, and cliche pandering to the 18-24 year old bachelors that are the stereotypical site audience. It's about hotel rooms. Received some highly positive reviews, some "this is well written, but not my thing" reviews. Basically mixed.
* [[[SCP-2817]]] - ("The Carpet King Prosecutes Itself") A simple story about a D-Class and his friendly childhood monster. SCP-001 assures you that there is nothing scary or upsetting in this one. Very good, but not enough people have read it. Researchers guess that this means reviews are mixed.
* [[[SCP-3000-J]]] - ("Kellogg's Foundation Flakes") A -J about cereal. Some people think it's the funniest thing since Stan Laurel and Lenny Bruce fucked, others don't. Reviews are quite mixed.
* [[[SCP-3999]]] ("I Am At The Center Of Everything That Happens To Me") Researcher Talloran is to --write a brief comedic review of SCP-3999 on behalf of SCP-001.--  SCP-3999 is --a highly rated bloated whopper of a skip, deep fried on a bun with pickles.-- Reviews are --mixed. Reviews are --not mixed.--
* [[[SCP-2653]]] - ("Sausages") SCP-001 is a gross leftie who loves him some lunch. Part of Glittering Horizon. Please pass the mixed mustard.

And on the tale side of things:

* [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/amnestic|Amnestic]]], a weird ass poem. It ties into [[*user minmin]]'s [[[SCP-2747]]]. Received reviews that could be described by some as mixed.
* [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/portrait-of-two-choreographers|Portrait of Two Choreographers]]], a short romantic character study. This was originally a short SCP, and the letters materialized in a haunted house. People did not like that one, but this version is more liked. So far, it's up from highly negative reviews to quite positive ones. The average review is mixed.
* [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/wade-williams-distribution|Wade Williams Distribution Presents]]], another weird ass poem about [[*user weizhong]]'s [[[SCP-2006]]]. Reviews are good in the same way a mixed drink is good. Mixed.
* [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/glittering-horizon-hub|Glittering Horizon]]], an ongoing piece of experimental fiction. It is worked on only when the Muses decide to dance around merrily like little babby crickets. Incorporates both SCP-2653 and Wade Williams Distribution Presents. As both pieces have low views, official science says reviews are mixed.
* [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/the-news-tonight-wednesday-april-26th-2017|The News Tonight: Wednesday April 26th, 2017]]], a tale in Glittering Horizon. Some people think the ending is rushed. Some people like the worldbuilding. Some people think the reviews are mixed.
* [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/lord-stonefish|xX_DrSwagClef's Proposal]]], THIS VERY AUTHOR PAGE WOOOOOOOOO I TRICKED YOU (shut up it's not funny - ed.) YES IT IS (no shut up - ed.) ITS REALLY FUCKING FUNNY GUYS BECAUSE IT'S RANDOOOOOM (the people on this site aren't children, they're adults with adult sensibilities - ed.) IM INSECUUUURE (yes you really are - ed.)
