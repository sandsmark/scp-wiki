**Relevant Information:** [[*user rioludoodle]] was peripherally aware of the SCP Foundation for several years before she went on an SCP binge in the month of May 2017. The Foundation universe captured her imagination at some point between her reading SCP-3008 and exploring various Canon hubs. She created a Wikidot account and joined the site at the start of June in hopes of making her own contributions to the community.

Her username is perhaps a bit of a mouthful, so she'll readily respond to the nickname "Rio". She is irregularly present on the IRC chat #site19, but will punctually reply to a Wikidot PM. Her works in progress may be found in [http://scpsandbox2.wikidot.com/rioludoodle her Sandbox].

**Other Information:** Rio takes music lessons in piano [[footnote]] which she is good at [[/footnote]] and guitar [[footnote]] which she is terrible at [[/footnote]]. She does digital art as a hobby on those occasions when she finds the motivation to draw. She adores animated movies, dogs, and chocolate, not necessarily in that order. 

It is with cult-like fervor that Rio declares her love for the FIRST Robotics Competition and her high school robotics team, which hijack much of her free time from January through April. On the other hand, it is with mild trepidation that Rio acknowledges that she is about to enter her senior year and must therefore figure out college applications.
