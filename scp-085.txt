**Item #:** SCP-085

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** [Revised on ██-██-████]. SCP-085 is to be contained in a single chalk-white bond drawing pad in a secure containment facility. Supervised contact with SCP-085 is unrestricted to all personnel with Level-2 access. All personnel coming into contact with SCP-085 are subject to searches and random psych analysis upon entering or leaving the containment area. 

Absolutely no paper or canvas media are allowed to exit SCP-085's containment room: any paper trash must be disposed of by incineration after careful inspection. Paper and art supplies are to be brought in only by authorized personnel. In case of fire, flames are smothered using a rapid atmospheric-replacement and CO2-dumping system. Personnel are advised to quickly secure an oxygen mask and tank from the wall at the first sign of smoke or fire to prevent asphyxiation, as this procedure cannot be halted until all fires are suppressed.

**Description:** SCP-085 is the result of an experiment conducted between [[[SCP-067]]] and [[[SCP-914]]]. 

Dr. ███-███-████████ proposed using SCP-914 on various settings on images created by [[[SCP-067]]]. Test Subject-1101F doodled a single female stick figure in summer dress with long hair hanging loose, with the name "Cassy" written underneath. Using the [Fine] setting, the 'Cassy' sketch was transmuted into her present sapient form. Further attempts to duplicate this result have been unsuccessful.

SCP-085 is completely sapient and, as of ██-██-████, aware of her two dimensional form and her limitations in a three-dimensional world. Although her voice is inaudible, she has learned to communicate with SCP Foundation personnel through sign language and writing, and may be communicated with by writing text on the paper she exists on, exibiting understanding regardless of language, but expressing confusion when confronted with misspellings or improper punctuation. 

SCP-085 can interact with any drawn object on the same page as if it were real. For example, she is able to wear drawn clothing, drive sketched cars, and drink painted beverages. With the exception of sentient organisms (all members of the kingdom //Animalia//) any drawn object becomes animate when in contact with SCP-085, but immediately ceases and holds position once out of contact. Artwork initially depicted as in motion such as ocean waves and swaying trees animate to an equilibrium state and stay at rest until acted upon by SCP-085.

SCP-085 has also demonstrated the ability to transfer from one sheet of image to another, as long as the two are flush. In the event SCP-085 enters a picture that does not support drawn objects (such as a repeating pattern), the picture is converted to a background image, SCP-085 perceives the picture as an endless plane of the image drawn upon it.

At the present time, SCP-085 can only exist upon paper or canvas surfaces: SCP-085 cannot transfer onto photos, cardboard, glass, or parchment. SCP-085 retains her simplistic form regardless of the style of the image she interacts with.

**Addendum 085-1** Note: When SCP-085 enters a comic book, visual novel, or other such media, her "voice" becomes visible in speech bubble form, but contains only a series of meaningless punctuation and lines, generally vertical, which apparently represent some form of communication. No current translation is possible.
