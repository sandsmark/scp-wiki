**Item #:** SCP-085

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** A chalk white bond drawing pad on an artist's table in Sector-7 is home to SCP-085. Supervised contact with SCP-085 is unrestricted to all personnel with Level-2 access. Unsupervised contact is restricted to Commanders only. All are subject to searches before contact and random psychoanalysis afterwards.

Absolutely no paper or canvas media are allowed to exit SCP-085's containment room. Paper and art supplies are to be brought in only by authorized personnel. In case of fire, flames are smothered using a rapid atmospheric-replacement and CO2-dumping system. Personnel are advised to quickly secure an oxygen mask and tank from the wall at the first sign of smoke or fire.

**Description:** SCP-085 is the result of an experiment conducted between [[[SCP-067]]] and [[[SCP-914]]]. On clean white paper, SCP-085 is a sentient black-and white-animated young woman drawn in clean strokes. Using [[[SCP-067]]], Test Subject-1101F drew a single female figure, about 15 cm (6 in) in height and 3.8 cm (1.5 in) wide, in summer dress with long hair pulled back into a pony tail. Underneath, the name Cassandra was penned. It was the idea of Dr. [EXPUNGED] to use SCP-914 on various settings on images created by [[[SCP-067]]]. Using the [Fine] setting, the 'Cassandra' sketch was transmuted into her present form.

SCP-085 prefers to be called 'Cassy.' She is completely sentient and aware of her 2D form and her limitations in a three-dimensional world. Though her voice is audible, she can not hear or see people in the third dimension. Conversations can be held with her by writing text on the paper she exists on. Personnel report that she is very amicable, friendly, and motivated, though she shows hints of loneliness. SCP-085 can interact with any drawn object on the same page, in full context of what is drawn. For example, she is able to wear drawn clothing, drive sketched cars, and drink painted beverages. Except for animals and people, any drawn object becomes animated when in contact with SCP-085 but immediately ceases and holds position once out of contact.

In the event SCP-085 enters a picture that does not support drawn objects (such as a repeating pattern), the picture is converted to a background image. SCP-085 perceives the picture as an endless plane of the image drawn upon it.

Paper and canvas media are the only surfaces on which she can exist, and she can 'hop' from one sheet of paper to another as long as the two are flush. She cannot 'hop' into photos, or onto cardboard or glass. When entering other pieces of art, SCP-085 takes on the artistic style of her new environment (whether it be a comic book, an oil painting, watercolor, or charcoal sketching). Note: in comic form, her voice is still audible, but she speaks in thought and voice bubbles around her head in typical comic fashion, and as she moves between panels the perspective and her relative size are altered appropriately. She is able to control the color of her hair and clothing the first time she enters a colored art piece.

Â She can remotely animate any object that was drawn in her presence on that page, meaning trees rustle in the wind and the ocean waves crash onto the shore. When she is unaware that she is being monitored, her facial expressions and body language convey feelings of loneliness. This is believed to be because of the low level of contact SCP-085 has while interacting with others.

**Document #085-1:** Introduction to several prints authored by M C Escher. 

> **Researcher**: Hello Cassy, this is known as "Ascending and Descending". What do you think?
> //(At this point, SCP-085 walks a few times around the staircase)//
> **SCP-085**: It's pretty, I guess. Would make a neat exercise track.
> **Researcher**: You see nothing inconsistent with the staircase?
> **SCP-085**: No, as far as I can tell it just loops around down/up all the time. Why don't more staircases do that? It's pretty neat.

After this session, SCP-085 requested several 'impossible' objects in her own environment. They have been granted.
