**Item #:** SCP-737

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-737 is to be kept in a locked copper safe welded to the wall in Storage Unit ██ at Site ██. In the event of a containment breach, staff are to attempt to incapacitate SCP-737 without touching or destroying its front carriage. SCP-737 is to be provided with three (3) inches of wood every day via a robotic arm. Any carriages produced by SCP-737 are to be removed from the main body and deposited back in the safe to restrict SCP-737's movements.

**Description:** SCP-737 is the front carriage of a wooden toy train approximately --three (3)-- five (5) centimeters tall, --two (2)-- four (4) centimeters thick and when without carriages, --four (4)-- six (6) centimeters long. X-Ray analysis has shown that the wooden portion of SCP-737 is an outer shell, protecting a small brain and biological tissue that make up its main body. SCP-737 is able to independently engage in locomotion, and does so constantly when given the opportunity.

When SCP-737 reaches an obstacle, it will, through a process as of yet unknown, absorb the material directly in front of it and usually incorporate it into itself in the form of a wooden train carriage. This process typically takes five to twenty seconds, depending on the density of the material. SCP-737 is unable to absorb the entire object, and typically leaves a hole which it will then proceed to move through. SCP-737 can absorb most substances, including wood, metal, plastic, [DATA EXPUNGED]. SCP-737 is unable to use some substances to increase its mass, and will instead release them in gas form from its 'chimney'. SCP-737 seems unwilling to absorb copper and its own carriages. SCP-737 is predatory, and will favor living targets over inanimate objects.

SCP-737 is likely vulnerable to damage, as the wood that comprises its outer shell shows no anomalous properties. Due to this, great care must be taken when handling SCP-737. As the chances of SCP-737 being a natural organism are extremely low, any clues as to its origin are to be reported immediately.

**History:** SCP-737 was first discovered by the Foundation in ███████ after a series of child disappearances came to the attention of the Foundation when the police received testimony of 'a toy train' fleeing from the crime scene. Mobile Task Force Mu-9 "Toybreakers" were sent in to investigate the matter, and despite losing █ of their group, were able to successfully retrieve SCP-737.

**Addendum 737-1:** //SCP-737's size has recently increased dramatically. If SCP-737 continues to grow at this rate, we may have to reconsider the containment procedures.// - Dr. Tarn

**Addendum 737-2:** At approximately ██:██ on ██/██/20██, a containment breach of SCP-███ caused SCP-737's regular feeding time to be missed. Twenty minutes after the containment breach, SCP-737 began slowly absorbing the copper in its safe at a rate of 1cm/hour, releasing a toxic and opaque gas from its 'chimney'. SCP-737 was quickly brought under control by the timely actions of Research Assistant ████, who described the gas as 'foul'. It now appears that although SCP-737 is unwilling to absorb copper, it does have the capacity to do so.
