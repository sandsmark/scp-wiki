**Item #:** SCP-737

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-737 is to be kept on its side in a locked safe welded to the wall in Storage Area ██ at Site ██. In the event of a containment breach, staff are to attempt to incapacitate SCP-737 without touching or destroying its front carriage. SCP-737 is to be provided with three (3) inches of wood every day via a robotic arm. Any carriages produced by SCP-737 are to be removed from the main body and disposed of.

**Description:** SCP-737 is the front carriage of a wooden toy train approximately --three (3)-- five (5) centimeters tall, --two (2)-- four (4) centimeters thick and when without carriages, --four (4)-- six (6) centimeters long. X-Ray tests have shown that the wooden portion of SCP-737 is an outer shell intended to protect the biological tissue and small brain inside, with any carriages produced by SCP-737 also possessing this biological tissue. SCP-737 is able to independently engage in locomotion, and does so constantly when given the opportunity.

When SCP-737 reaches an obstacle, it will, through a process as of yet unknown, absorb the material directly in front of it and usually incorporate it into itself in the form of a new carriage. SCP-737 cannot use some substances to increase its mass, and will instead release them in gas form from its 'chimney'. SCP-737 will not absorb the whole object, and typically leaves a hole which it proceeds to move through. SCP-737 can absorb most substances, including wood, metal, plastic, [DATA EXPUNGED]. SCP-737 seems to primarily be a predator, and will favor living targets over inanimate objects.

Tests on carriages produced by SCP-737 have determined that SCP-737 is not indestructible. Due to this, great care must be taken when handling SCP-737. As the chances of SCP-737 being a natural organism are extremely unlikely, any clues as to its origin are to be reported immediately.

**History:** SCP-737 was discovered by the Foundation in ███████ after a series of child disappearances came to the attention of the Foundation when the police received testimony of 'a toy train' fleeing from the crime scene. Mobile Task Force Mu-9 "Toybreakers" were sent in to investigate the matter, and despite losing █ of their group, were able to successfully retrieve SCP-737.

**Addendum:** //SCP-737's size has recently increased dramatically. If SCP-737 continues to grow at this rate, we may have to reconsider the containment procedures.// - Dr. Tarn
