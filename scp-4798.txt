**Item #:** SCP-4798

**Object Class:** --Euclid-- Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** As per Protocol R19, the 930km^^2^^ area surrounding SCP-4798 is to remain under strict quarantine. The border of this region is to be regularly patrolled to prevent any unauthorized persons from entering the restricted area. Border patrols are required to be outfitted in BCS Mk. V-class hazmat suits. Site AZ-121 is to be monitored at all times by Foundation satellites and long-range scanners in the event of any expansion of SCP-4798-C. In the event of breach of containment, Contingency 91 is to be observed, and all instances of SCP-4798-1 (including human individuals affected by the anomaly) are to be eliminated and sterilized, before relocation to Site 96 for processing.

**Description:** SCP-4798 refers to a population of anomalous organisms, primarily flora, which grow in a roughly 0.4km^^2^^ radius surrounding the Shallow Moon Astronomical Observatory (henceforth referred to as Site AZ-121) atop Ginger Mountain in Apache County, Arizona. No external record exists of this observatory’s construction or management. SCP-4798 entails the collective mutations and anomalous properties of the organisms in this population. Some instances of SCP-4798 appear to be mutations of various organisms native to Arizona, while others are wholly unclassified in any existing biological paradigm. Each instance of SCP-4798 demonstrates unique and often anomalous properties, most of which fall under Safe or Euclid classification.

These anomalous properties emerge from the unique molecular composition of each instance of SCP-4798. SCP-4798 is believed to be a product of transgenic poetry, the anomalous process of using the written word to synthesize nucleotides in DNA. Each instance of SCP-4798 appears to represent an expression of different meanings through a form of anomalous molecular semantics. Based on insights gained from SCP-4798-1 (see Addendum II), a decoding mechanism referred to as DX-64 was employed at Site AZ-121 for the purpose of demonstrating the semantic expression present in the nucleotides of SCP-4798. The molecular coding of any given organism can be translated into coherent semantics, usually in the form of “poems.” Addendum I contains examples of the semantics of various organisms observed at Site AZ-121.

Instances of SCP-4798 have the ability to spread to other biological organisms, though while SCP-4798 is biological in nature, the spread thereof appears to be pseudo-memetic. This has resulted in the mutation of organisms not originally associated with the anomaly, henceforth referred to as SCP-4798-1. This includes various human subjects, including Foundation personnel, who develop usually harmless (sans SCP-4798-C involvement) biological mutations, often with anomalous properties. Instances of SCP-4798-1 also express molecular semantics of similar nature to SCP-4798 proper. Human instances of SCP-4798-1 often demonstrate a heightened understanding of the purported “meaning” and semantic nature of SCP-4798, often accompanied by abnormal behavior and mental processes. Instances of SCP-4798-1 tend to revert to ordinary biological conditions with time; in humans, this is accompanied by the loss of the intuitive connection to SCP-4798 and its “meaning,” often accompanied by feelings of absence, sadness, and/or melancholy.

As per Protocol R19, further research of SCP-4798 has been indefinitely suspended.

The majority of instances of SCP-4798 are flora or pseudo-floral organisms, many of which resemble species native to the region of Site AZ-121. Many also appear to be of other clades. Each instance of SCP-4798 has been observed to be genetically unique, containing anomalous and often incoherent combinations of nucleotides on the molecular level. As a result of insights from SCP-4798-1, the DX-64 decoding algorithm was developed to unravel the complicated “biological language” of SCP-4798. Each instance of SCP-4798 appears to expresses a different “poem” of molecular semantics; these are believed to be related to the meanings of the anomaly overall, which in turn correlate with the anomalous properties of the instance of SCP-4798 in question. --Many of these poems are considered incomplete.--

> **SCP-4798-40196**
> 
> **Description:** Monocot flowering plant resembling the species //Yucca angustissima//.
> 
> **Anomalous Properties:** SCP-4798-40197 manifests a weather anomaly within a 1m^^2^^ radius of itself in the form of a 6m/s wind from the northwest. This results in the development of striped patterns in the sand caused by wind and erosion.
> 
> **Expression:** //In this life of lines / I’ve come to find / That I lie outside / And when I sleep / I sigh for you / And when I wake / I die for you / And they will say my cycle / Followed or deviated / In their design / But we both say / That I abandoned the trees / To set us both free//

> **SCP-4798-21195**
> 
> **Description:** Unidentified gray-brown shrub.
> 
> **Anomalous Properties:** The structure SCP-4798-21195 beneath its external cell layer is devoid of any matter whatsoever; the exterior of the organism reacts regularly to gravitational and environmental stimuli, but the interior is a vacuum space lacking gravity and seemingly existing outside of Einsteinian physics. Occasional bursts of microwave radiation have been measured from within SCP-4798-21195.
> 
> **Expression:** //What we call sacred / Is it what we call stolen? / They said what we know was fed / And what we saw was / Written by the songs of before / But we are not a sum of memories / Because nothing is nothing / And because nothing will tell us how / We don’t obey nothing / No end to sentence//

> **SCP-4798-04151**
> 
> **Description:** Population of bees, possibly of the genus //Xylocopa//.
> 
> **Anomalous Properties:** Instances of SCP-4798-04151 have developed what appears to be a complex movement system seemingly with no benefit to survival or communication. This movement system responds to various seemingly unrelated stimuli. For example, movements become more erratic when SCP-4798-04151 is exposed to radioactive material, but slow significantly in the presence of any object of the color purple.
> 
> **Expression:** //She said she didn’t like sound / So we sang for her / She said she didn’t like softness / So we stole the sun for her / She said she didn’t like snakes / So we shook for her / She said she knew we wouldn’t speak / So we were silent for her / And when she said she’d hide / We exploded//

> **SCP-4798-83865**
> 
> **Description:** Unidentified lizard species, 4.20cm in length.
> 
> **Anomalous Properties:** SCP-4798-83865 appears only capable of existing while standing on paper. First observed on the notebooks of on-site researchers, SCP-4798-83865 will manifest on any paper near Site AZ-121. 27 individual instances have been documented.
> 
> **Expression:** //Hold onto your heart / Because I’m not the sky / I inhabited the spaces they didn’t see / My science of the particular / Songs and pictures you soften / Without anyone there but me / If we’re better off alone / But better off together / Then we live in the little//

> **SCP-4798-06632**
> 
> **Description:** Unidentified flowering plant, 20.1cm in length
> 
> **Anomalous Properties:** SCP-4798-06632 emits radio signals on a wide scale, but which have only been received by a radio station located in Minokamo, Gifu Prefecture, Japan. These signals result in surreal imagery appearing on connected televisions, including abnormal combinations of clips from television programs from the past thirteen years. Investigation of these signals led to the initial discovery of SCP-4798 by Foundation personnel.
> 
> **Expression:** //Lover you’re not my sibling / Drifting cattle you’re not my foe / All this world I rearranged it / It takes sixteen feet to start / Who will this belong to tomorrow? / Who does it become today? / I was here, that was why I ran away//

The following is a series of interrogations of instances of SCP-4798-1 expressed in Foundation personnel.

> **<Begin Log>**
> 
> **Researcher Tannenbaum:** “Researcher █████, are you feeling alright? Can I get you anything?”
> 
> **SCP-4798-1-05:** “No, I’m fine, I’m fine. Seriously, don’t worry. It’s actually not bad.”
> 
> **Researcher Tannenbaum:** “What’s not bad?”
> 
> **SCP-4798-1-05:** “Well, I mean, this. I was scared, but it’s actually somewhat interesting, being an anomaly myself. It kind of makes you wonder what we mean by that. ‘Anomaly.’ What exactly are we comparing to?”
> 
> **Researcher Tannenbaum:** “Please try and stay focused, █████. I need you to tell me… are you experiencing anything you would consider out of the ordinary? Hallucinations, sensations… anything like that?”
> 
> **SCP-4798-1-05:** “Oh yeah, definitely. It’s very strange, actually – I can hear everything that’s going on in just one place, in just one city. Istedgade, in Copenhagen. Oh hey! An American tourist! Funny, that makes the world seem so small.”
> 
> **Researcher Tannenbaum:** █████…
> 
> **SCP-4798-1-05:** “Sorry, I’m getting distracted. Yeah, anomalous sensations. I would say that is a definite yes. I don’t know why it’s that particular street, in that particular city, but at the same time, I kind of feel like… why not? I make a meaning of that. This whole place is about making meanings.”
> 
> **Researcher Tannenbaum:** “What do you mean?”
> 
> **SCP-4798-1-05:** “How can I explain this… it’s like there’s a poetry to everything. But it’s not like something scripted. Does that make sense? It’s like everything in this place – every expression of SCP-4798 – is singing. The most interesting thing of all is that it’s words becoming things. Poetry expressed through biology.”
> 
> **Researcher Tannenbaum:** “What, it’s anart?”
> 
> **SCP-4798-1-05:** “I think you could call it that, yeah. But I couldn’t tell you what it means. I think… well, I mean, it means something. But that’s not something I can say.”
> 
> **Researcher Tannenbaum:** “Why not?”
> 
> **SCP-4798-1-05:** “Because I don’t think it knows what that meaning is.”
> 
> **<End Log>**

> **SCP-4798-1-12**
> 
> **Date:** 21 November 2004
> 
> **<Begin Log>**
> 
> **Researcher Tannenbaum:** “Tell me what you mean when you say ‘expressions.’”
> 
> **SCP-4798-1-12:** “So, each of these things – every one of the organisms on this site – they’re all a part of a big poem of sorts, though I don’t know who the writer might have been, if there even was one. They pass on these words like offspring, which express themselves as genotypes and phenotypes in the given organisms. Does that make sense?”
> 
> **Researcher Tannenbaum:** “Sure. It’s not the first anomaly like this that we’ve seen. But what I want to know is the fundamentals of its nature - something of its order, something reproducible and scientific. What is the meaning of SCP-4798?”
> 
> **SCP-4798-1-12:** “I wish I could say, but I don’t know. Even now, I… it’s so, so strange. All of these things are just so alien and yet so familiar. I’m not like Researcher ████████… all that happened to me was the skin on my arm getting darker. But why does it feel like more than that? I don’t know, Tannenbaum, it’s…”
> 
> **Researcher Tannenbaum:** “Go ahead.”
> 
> **SCP-4798-1-12:** “… it’s like I know this poem, this collection of words and sounds. Like it’s a part of my soul. It goes beyond just writing words that correlate to specific biological traits. You won’t be able to type in ‘bloom’ and get a flower… all the thoughts intermingle here, but they don’t adhere to anything. It’s not specific and ordered, it’s just… a feeling in words. Growing, undefined, uncertain. But real.”
> 
> **Researcher Tannenbaum:** “So you can’t tell me anything else?”
> 
> **SCP-4798-1-12:** “Well, I can tell you one thing. But…”
> 
> **Researcher Tannenbaum:** “Yes?”
> 
> **SCP-4798-1-12:** “//I sought this division to ride / Will I or won’t I abide? / To be one and separate / Accumulate and disperse my song / This assured threat of existence / Fiction more powerful than life / Ghosts that live in matter / A crescent moon and a little girl//”

> **Date:** 5 March 2005
> 
> **<Begin Log>**
> 
> **Researcher Tannenbaum:** “Researcher ████, you’re one of my best. I want you to tell me everything you can. What is the meaning of SCP-4798?”
> 
> **SCP-4798-1-41:** “Tannenbaum, I… I wish I could. But I don’t know if I can think of things like that. It’s so hard to be rational right now. I’m sorry.”
> 
> **Researcher Tannenbaum:** “Just try your best. It’s an anomaly, it’s not you, okay? Just tell me what you can, don’t worry about whether it makes sense.”
> 
> **SCP-4798-1-41:** “It’s like… I just don’t think SCP-4798 is trying to be anything in particular. I mean, why does it have to be? It’s strange, for me to think that… I mean, everything has to be something. But this isn’t, or at least it doesn’t seem to be. You can’t just classify this, or reduce it. I’m starting to think… I’m starting to think they all might be like this.”
> 
> **Researcher Tannenbaum:** “All anomalies?”
> 
> **SCP-4798-1-41:** “God, I could get fired for spewing nonsense like this.”
> 
> **Researcher Tannenbaum:** “Please, ████…”
> 
> **SCP-4798-1-41:** “We’re here to preserve consensus reality, but here I am questioning it.”
> 
> **Researcher Tannenbaum:** “Please, it’s alright. You’re under the influence of an anomaly, it’s not something you should feel bad about.”
> 
> **SCP-4798-1-41:** “It just feels so real, Tannenbaum. It’s like I know this all from somewhere. The expression I was given is a reflection of me in this place. All of them are just expressions, and I think it’s like a million different stories all wrapped up into one. It’s uncertainty personified. But it’s also… it’s also me. It’s all me.”
> 
> **Researcher Tannenbaum:** “Okay, ████, okay. Take it easy. Let’s take this slowly.”
> 
> **SCP-4798-1-41:** “All I know for sure is that this doesn’t come from here, Tannenbaum. This is all just us trying to make sense of it by putting it here. But it’s from somewhere else. You can feel it… but you can’t understand it with words. That’s exactly why it’s made of words.”

**__EVALUATION 05/14/2005 – Researcher ███████ Tannenbaum__**

**Description:** SCP-4798 is an unidentified memetic entity or class of entities that expresses itself through biological organisms on the molecular level. This anomalous expression --of unknown origin-- affects the nucleotides of given organisms and modifies them into “poems” with unspecific meanings that nonetheless appear to affect the anomalous properties of the resultant organisms. These poems pass on to other organisms acausally and thus expand the dimensions of expression possessed by SCP-4798. --The origins and fundamental nature of SCP-4798 are unknown and possibly unclassifiable.--

**Item #:** SCP-4798-C

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** [R19]

**Description:** SCP-4798-C is a memetic virus which occurs in SCP-4798 and spreads to instances of SCP-4798-1. SCP-4798-C alters the molecular semantics of instances of SCP-4798, resulting in new gene expressions and mutations with often hazardous or violent anomalous effects. Expressions of SCP-4798-C analyzed by DX-64 demonstrate themes of █████ ██████████ ███ █████ ██████████ █████ █████ lethal impact on biological organisms exposed to SCP-4798-C. This virus has been referred to by instances of SCP-4798-C as “the Seemingly Endless.” --It is believed that SCP-4798-C was somehow introduced to Site AZ-121 by Foundation personnel.--

**History:** The first recorded instance of SCP-4798-C occurred on August 15, 2005, when instances of SCP-4798 developed new anomalous properties with hazardous results. Numerous instances of SCP-4798 became hostile to other life, spreading minor biological viruses or generating lethal anomalous effects. Within weeks, expressions of SCP-4798-C were recognized in human personnel, and emergency containment procedures were implemented. Eventually, after recognizing the threat of SCP-4798-C, Foundation personnel evacuated Site AZ-121 and Protocol R19 was implemented by O5-██.

**Addendum X:** Instances of SCP-4798-C

> **SCP-4798-C-06**
> 
> **Description:** Small desert shrub, previously demonstrated anomalous property 30614 per Site AZ-121 SOTA. Upon contamination, SCP-4798-C-06 caused all animals within a radius of 1.3m^^2^^ to experience violent and lethal seizures.
> 
> **Expression:** //They could be one / They could be strung / They could be aligned / They are perfect / To stretch you beyond limit / To crush you beyond ease / They may harden the fabric / They may soften the veil / They may escape your hugs / And eat your lies//

> **SCP-4798-C-24**
> 
> **Description:** Flowering tree, previously demonstrated anomalous property 21912 per Site AZ-121 SOTA. Upon contamination, SCP-4798-C-24 generated a multidirectional gravitational field equivalent to that of a type-K supergiant star, resulting in any organisms or items within the field’s radius being ripped apart.

> **Expression:** //Somber and somber / Somber and somber / Somber and somber / Somber and somber / Somber and somber / Somber and somber / Somber and somber / Somber and somber / Somber and somber / Somber and somber / Sever and sever//

> **SCP-4798-C-104**
> 
> **Description:** SCP-4798-C-104’s anomalous effects manifested in multiple Foundation personnel in the form of carving on human skin, writing out its expression. 21 Foundation members died from blood loss before SCP-4798-C-104’s spread was halted.
> 
> **Expression:** //Here are the hated lines / They are closer to your head / And riding down your grain / Dreams of sickness they wrote / Nightmares are the only free / Daydreams were murdered they hunt / Your sign your weakness your soul//

> **SCP-4798-C-115**
> 
> **Description:** Researcher ██████████. After displaying symptoms of anemia for three hours prior, SCP-4798-C-115’s blood began gravitating heavily toward a glass window in Site AZ-121, quickly resulting in SCP-4798-C-115’s death. The blood on the window then wrote out SCP-4798-C-115’s expression.
> 
> **Expression:** //They won’t set you free / They won’t see you fall / They cut and they categorize / They undo just to shine / They will never see the flowers / Your small things, are they me? / You will someday see / You project yourself onto me//
