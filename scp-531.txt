**Item # SCP-531**

**Object class:** Safe

**Special containment procedures:** SCP-531 statues are effectively harmless when kept in pairs (or larger groups - see experiment-489). When not being studied they are stored in matched pairs in the medium-security facility [REDACTED], placed in wall alcoves on opposite sides along a marble-lined hallway in an arrangement that approximates the circumstances where the original pair was found. The alcoves have concealed sliding doors that can be remotely closed to make it easier to approach them for maintenance or experimentation. There are currently fourteen statues in inventory, numbered SCP-531-1 to SCP-531-14. //Note: due to sloppy record-keeping by [REDACTED] (since lost in testing) the identity of the two specific statues that made up the original pairing has been lost.//

It has been proposed that SCP-531 statues, alone or in pairs, could be put to use as part of Foundation security and containment measures. Their effectiveness in this role has not been tested.

**Description:** SCP-531 consists of several paired sets of brass statues depicting stylized felines. The cats are in a seated posture, looking forward with ears raised in what is usually described as an 'intense' or 'attentive' expression. Each cat is 74.2 cm tall and is not hollow, each weighing 451.7 kilograms. Their eyes are inset with what appear to be polished tiger-eye stones that give an impression of luminescence, though they do not emit visible light directly.

The first pair of these statues was found in a tomb near [REDACTED] in Egypt that dated to approximately [REDACTED] BC. The outer chamber of the tomb had been thoroughly looted in antiquity. The two SCP-531 statues were located in the passage leading to the inner chamber, resting in alcoves 54 cm above the floor on either side of the passage and facing each other across it. Although the passage was open no looting had occurred beyond this point. The expedition's members experienced an extreme aversion to passing in between the two statues and it is speculated that this psychological barrier is what protected the inner chamber from prior looters.

The expedition managed to overcome this barrier through [REDACTED] means and proceeded to retrieve the tomb's artifacts (No other SCP items were among them but they were later impounded at a Foundation facility anyway - see annex 531-88). The last item to be retrieved were SCP-531 themselves. One of the two statues was hoisted down from its alcove and crated for transport, with the plan being to crate the second one the next day. At some point during the night [REDACTED] went missing and a new replacement statue was found occupying the vacated alcove. The expedition decided to re-seal the tomb with these two statues remaining in their alcoves. The statue they'd placed in a crate was taken with them to [REDACTED] institute, where another individual went missing and another new statue was found in storage paired with the original. It was at this point that Foundation staff retrieved both pairs of statues along with the other artifacts from the tomb.

**Properties:**

When a pair of two SCP-531 statues are facing each other they produce a powerful suggestive effect preventing anyone passing between them. This is a psychological effect; no measurable physical force is generated, and it can be overcome by very strong-willed individuals. It is conjectured that this is the primary function of the statues, and in and of itself this effect is harmless.

If the line of sight between the two statues is broken a more dangerous aspect of SCP-531's effects manifests itself. An observer will be drawn to meet the gaze of one of the orphaned statues himself. Once the gaze is met the observer is unable to break eye contact without an effort of will beyond the capability of most people.

The trapped individual will feel a mental pressure forcing him to crouch down so that his eyes are level with the statue's. After several minutes in this pose the subject's body begins to slowly stiffen and become heavier as a transmutation effect takes hold, converting the subject into a duplicate SCP-531 over the course of approximately one hour. The subject remains aware throughout the process but will remain unable to break the statue's gaze. Once the physical transmutation has begun there is no known way to halt or reverse it.

The duplicate is an exact copy and produces the same effects as the original SCP-531 statues. It is unclear whether this duplicative effect was intended by whatever agency created the original SCP-531s or if it is a side effect of the powerful link between the two statues.

**Experiment-481:**
A Class-D subject with a high measured psychological resistance threshold was exposed to a lone SCP-531.

Partial transcript:

D: "What is... It's beautiful, where is it from? Its... its eyes..."
Dr. [REDACTED]: "What about its eyes?"
D: "They're... demanding eyes. Demanding. I... I can't look away. Hey, seriously, I can't."
[Subject tries to grasp [REDACTED]'s arm, but a security guard delivers a mild jolt from a stun baton to remind subject against such actions. Subject yelps but doesn't break eye contact with the statue.]
Dr. [REDACTED]: "What is it demanding?"
D: "I don't... Oh, god. No, please, no."
Dr. [REDACTED]: [repeats question]
D: "It's demanding _me_. It wants... it _needs_ me. No! No, I won't!"
[...]
[0:27]
[At this point the subject is crouched down directly in front of SCP-531, trembling and sweating profusely.]
D: "Please, God, no..."
Dr. [REDACTED]: "Come now, we've heard your praying enough already. Nobody's listening to that. What is the _statue_ saying?"
D: "Lonely, oh God, so lonely... her partner's gone. She has nobody to talk to now. Nobody to complete her."
[note: the particular SCP-531 the subject is interacting with used to be Dr. [REDACTED], who was indeed female. Subject was not prompted with knowledge about the statue's former gender.]
Dr. [REDACTED]: "What's her name?"
D: "I don't... uh... Oh God. I don't know. Please let me stop looking at her!"
Dr. [REDACTED]: "None of _us_ are forcing you. Talk to your partner about that."
[...]

[Subject is still crouched and breathing is labored but subject is no longer trembling. Subject's clothing has begun crumbling into a fine powder, with large sections peeling away to expose unnaturally smooth and bronze-tinted skin. The shape of the subject's body is also more noticeably feline at this point. Subject's eyes now resemble polished amber stones and are unable to blink, though tears continue to leak from their corners.]
Dr. [REDACTED]: "Are you still resisting her?"
D: "Yes... bastard..."
Dr. [REDACTED]: "Keep it up, we're getting great data."
D: [sobbing laugh] "Says... can't help... says... you're a... bastard too..."
Dr. [REDACTED]: "Oh? Perhaps, but I'm a bastard who follows safety protocols better than she did."
[...]
[1:09]
[Subject is now almost indistinguishable from the other SCP-531. Its skin has a fully metallic sheen and its immobile body is shaped like a large cat. Vital signs telemetry indicates less than one beat per minute heart rate and the movement of its chest while breathing is imperceptible.]
Dr. [REDACTED]: "Are we done here?"
[Dr. [REDACTED] raps his knuckles lightly on subject's head, producing a metallic clink.]
D: [unintelligible sigh]
Dr. [REDACTED]: "Again?"
[Dr. [REDACTED] holds a microphone closer to the subject's mouth.]
D: "...beautiful..."
[No further audible response comes from the subject. Heartbeat ceases at 1:13].

**Experiment-482:**
A lone SCP-531 was allowed to begin establishing a connection with a test subject and then the connection was severed with an opaque barrier once the test subject began to turn brassy. The test subject still completed the transmutation but it took approximately 36 hours.

**Experiment-483:**
One member of an SCP-531 pair was placed on a mobile platform and was moved away from the other member to determine the range of their connection. The connection appeared to be severed at the 55 meter mark.

**Experiment-484:**
A lone SCP-531 was placed in front of a mirror. D-class personnel then assessed whether this would behave as a lone statue or a pair. It behaved as a lone statue, converting the test subject into a new partner. Notable, however, was that the test subject locked gazes and was converted via the mirror's reflection. The Perseus Protocol would appear to be ineffective protection.

**Experiment-485:**
A lone SCP-531 was exposed to a test subject via closed-circuit television. No connection was achieved.

**Experiment-486:**
A lone SCP-531 was exposed to a test subject with filters of various wavelengths separating them. Filters were removed one by one until a connection was established and the subject was converted into an SCP-531 partner. Curiously, the key wavelength appears to be infrared in the three to four micron range (a range that the mirror used in a previous experiment was capable of reflecting). Subsequent examination with more sensitive detectors showed that the eyes of SCP-531 statues exchange a very dim narrow-band signal at 3.77 microns. Signal strength matches closely with weak electrical fields in the statues that had been previously measured and interpreted as residual brain wave activity. The information content of the signal, if any, is thus far indecipherable.

**Experiment-487:**
A pair of SCP-531 statues were arranged with one on a rotatable platform. The statue was slowly rotated until its connection with its partner was broken and it established one with a test subject instead. The critical angle was found to be 29.2 degrees, plus or minus 0.1 degree. The infra-red signal emitted by SCP-531 falls off dramatically outside this cone.

**Experiment-488:**
Infra-red detectors and emitters tuned to 3.77 microns were used to attempt to maintain a connection between two physically separate SCP-531 statues. The attempt failed. It is unclear whether the artificial link was simply of insufficient quality, or if there are additional channels being used that we're still unaware of.

**Experiment-489:**
Three SCP-531 statues were arranged in a triangle such that two of the statues were both within the critical angle of the third. A test subject was introduced and none of the SCP-531s attempted to form a connection with her. This suggests that one SCP-531 can maintain a connection with multiple partners. Further testing may find an upper limit. One advantage to working with SCP-531 is that one can always have more of them if needed - it's the most controllable self-replicator we've got.
