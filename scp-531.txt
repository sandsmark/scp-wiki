**Item # SCP-531**

**Object class:** Safe

**Special containment procedures:** SCP-531 statues are effectively harmless when kept in pairs (or larger groups - see experiment-489). When not being studied they are stored in matched pairs in the medium-security facility [REDACTED], placed in wall alcoves on opposite sides along a marble-lined hallway in an arrangement that approximates the circumstances where the original pair was found. The alcoves have sliding doors that can be closed via remote control to make it easier to approach them for maintenance or experimentation. There are currently fourteen statues in inventory, numbered SCP-531-1 to SCP-531-14 (identifying tags are on collars fastened around the statues' necks).

It has been proposed that SCP-531 statues, alone or in pairs, could be put to use as part of Foundation security and containment measures. They could theoretically constrain the movement of sapient SCPs that physical barriers are ineffective against. This has not yet been tested in practice.

**Description:** SCP-531 consists of several paired sets of brass statues depicting stylized felines. The cats are in a seated posture, looking forward with ears raised in what is usually described as an 'intense' or 'attentive' expression. Each cat is 74.2 cm tall and is not hollow, each weighing 451.7 kilograms. Their eyes are inset with what appear to be polished tiger-eye stones that give an impression of luminescence, though they do not emit visible light directly.

The first pair of these statues was found in a tomb near [REDACTED] in Egypt that dated to approximately [REDACTED] BC. The outer chamber of the tomb had been thoroughly looted in antiquity. The two SCP-531 statues were located in the passage leading to the inner chamber, resting in alcoves 54 cm above the floor on either side of the passage and facing each other across it. Although the passage was open no looting had occurred beyond this point. The expedition's members experienced an extreme aversion to passing in between the two statues and it is speculated that this psychological barrier is what protected the inner chamber from prior looters.

The expedition managed to overcome this barrier through [REDACTED] means and proceeded to retrieve the tomb's artifacts (No other SCP items were among them but they were later impounded at a Foundation facility anyway - see annex 531-88). The last item to be retrieved were SCP-531 themselves. One of the two statues was hoisted down from its alcove and crated for transport, with the plan being to crate the second one the next day. At some point during the night [REDACTED] went missing and a new replacement statue was found occupying the vacated alcove. The expedition decided to re-seal the tomb with these two statues remaining in their alcoves. The statue they'd placed in a crate was taken with them to [REDACTED] institute, where another individual went missing and another new statue was found in storage paired with the original. It was at this point that Foundation staff retrieved both pairs of statues along with the other artifacts from the tomb.

//Note: due to sloppy record-keeping by [REDACTED] (who was lost during early testing of SCP-531's properties) it is not known which two of the four statues impounded by the Foundation at that point were the 'originals'.//

**Properties:**

When a pair of two SCP-531 statues are facing each other they produce a powerful suggestive effect preventing anyone passing between them. This is a psychological effect; no measurable physical force is generated, and it can be overcome by very strong-willed individuals. It is conjectured that this is the primary function of the statues, and in and of itself this effect is harmless.

If the line of sight between the two statues is broken a more dangerous aspect of SCP-531's effects manifests itself. An observer will be drawn to meet the gaze of one of the orphaned statues himself. Once the gaze is met the observer is unable to break eye contact without an effort of will beyond the capability of most people.

The trapped individual will feel a mental pressure forcing him to crouch down so that his eyes are level with the statue's. After several minutes in this pose the subject's body begins to slowly stiffen and become heavier as a transmutation effect takes hold, converting the subject into a duplicate SCP-531 over the course of approximately one hour. The subject remains aware throughout the process but will remain unable to break the statue's gaze. Once the physical transmutation has begun there is no known way to halt or reverse it.

The duplicate is an exact copy and produces the same effects as the original SCP-531 statues. It is unclear whether this duplicative effect was intended by whatever agency created the original SCP-531s or if it is a side effect of the powerful link between the two statues.
