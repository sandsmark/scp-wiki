**Item #:** SCP-184

**Object Class:** Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:
SCP-184 is not to be contained in any structure.  SCP-184 is to be attached to a high power electromagnet at all times.  Should the electromagnet fail, agents are to report to SCP-184s containment area and prevent access to all unauthorized personnel until the electromagnet is restored to power.  The containment area for SCP-184 is currently configured to resemble a park with SCP-184 and its containment magnet disguised as statuary.  Any and all visitors are to be monitored.

Any structures affected by SCP-184 are to be demolished after review by [DATA EXPUNGED].  Final demolition approval or inclusion into SCP will also be determined by this body.  No investigation is to be done into effected structures without approval and a rescue team on standby.

**Description:** 
SCP-184 is a small object four inches tall and four inches wide.  It is a ball-shape, made of pentagon-shaped plates with holes in the middle, and small spheres on each “point” of intersection.  It is made of an unknown alloy, but is highly magnetic.  Its surface is smooth, and behaves like brass when subjected to a hardness test.  

When inside an enclosed structure, SCP-184 expands the inner dimensions without altering the outer dimensions.  It will increase the inner dimensions of any enclosed structure by several hundred feet each day.  It begins this expansion one hour after entry to an enclosed structure.  Initially, it only extends out the walls, causing rooms to become much larger without adjusting the height of the room.  This continues until the original square footage has been increased by 200%.

After the 200% mark, SCP-184 starts creating wholly new rooms.  It is able to apparently copy items from inside the structure, creating furnished rooms consistent with the rest of the structure.  After a period of time, however, the expansion process appears to break down.  

Items will be made from inappropriate materials (glass books, a wooden microwave), rooms will be oddly shaped, doors will open into blank walls, hallways will be tiny, or twist back around in long mazes.  The new inside structures continue to be more and more odd, while the outside remains unchanged.

This behavior is most dramatically illustrated in homes, however it has been observed in other instances, including a cardboard box.  The changes do not go away with the removal of SCP-184, but no additional structures are created.  

**Addendum:** Notes from Dr.█████

I don’t think I need to stress the fact that this thing can NEVER be allowed into Site 19.  We may need to look into different containment at some point, but for the time being, we will keep it in the open, immoveable, and hidden.
