One of the primary purposes of the SCP Foundation is to preserve normalcy, to make sure that John Q. Public can wake up in the morning to a world where there isn't such a thing as monsters, where up will always be up, and down down.  A place where he can wake up in the same world he went to sleep in.

And now they've failed.  An XK-scenario was halted through the combined efforts of the Foundation and the GOC.  However, in the process, most of North Korea was destroyed.  Even that might have been explained away, somehow, but in the midst of the crisis, sensitive information was leaked from the UN, leading to a public disclosure of many of the players in the paranormal world and their agendas.

Now that the world knows about the Foundation, knows that their world is a far stranger place than they expected, what will the world do?
