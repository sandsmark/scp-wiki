title:Agent Diogenes' Personnel File
**Agent “Diogenes”**

**Security Clearance Level:** [DATA EXPUNGED] 

**Occupation:** Public Liaison and Media Control

**History:**

Prior to becoming part of the Foundation’s personnel, Diogenes worked as a secretary under the United States Senator ██████. Diogenes attempted to blackmail Senator ██████, after discovering his correspondences with the Foundation concerning [DATA EXPUNGED]. The Foundation dissolved this affair by offering Diogenes two choices: to be [DATA EXPUNGED] or to take an occupation as a low level caretaker of safe-SCPs. Diogenes accepted the second offer, but soon showed such incompetence in handling assigned SCPs (see Addendum) that O5 requested s/he be placed in a different occupation. Displaying skills in diplomacy, Diogenes was designated tasks as a public liaison. As of this time, s/he has assisted in covering up incidents involving:  

[[[SCP-474]]]
[[[SCP-551]]]
[[[SCP-397]]]

**Addendum:** 

Due to a work accident, as well as the unauthorized practical joking of other personnel, Diogenes has come into contact with [[[SCP-113]]] on multiple occasions. It has therefore become impossible to determine Diogenes’ gender, and s/he responds to inquiry with raised eyebrows. S/he responds to almost any inquiry from Dr. Brights with a suitable facepalm.
