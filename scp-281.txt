**Item #:** SCP-281

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-281 is currently contained within maximum security storage locker 18-E on level 7 of Site-76. SCP-281's lithium-ion battery pack is to remain plugged into Site-76's main power grid unless being used in testing. Necessary cables have been supplied and are stored with the object.

Because of the nature of the object's anomalous properties and the potential for Boulle-class events, testing on SCP-281 is to be authorized and strictly monitored by the Level 4 senior member of research staff currently assigned to this project. Note that it is not recommended to set the timer component at more than twenty-five minutes. Tests are to be run only in Site-76's specially constructed testing environment for SCP-281, with special care being taken not to introduce foreign organisms. Should such an organism inadvertently be present during activation of SCP-281, personnel overseeing testing are to start the chamber's incineration sequence.

D-Class personnel used in testing are not to be informed on the nature of SCP-281. In addition, any D-Class personnel that survive testing procedures are to be terminated immediately afterwards to minimize the spread of information on SCP-281's effects. See document 281-D/Rstr for currently authorized personnel. Any personnel not on this list demonstrating knowledge of information disclosed in this document are to be detained, debriefed and terminated as per procedure 281-P/SecInf. Personnel transferred from the SCP-281 project to other positions are to be administered C-class amnesiacs prior to reassignment.

**Description:** SCP-281 is a makeshift device measuring approximately 25 cm x 35 cm x 20 cm. Built into the device is a high capacity lithium-ion laptop battery to provide power. In addition, the object incorporates a variety of components from such diverse sources as a Philips brand alarm clock, a digital kitchen timer of unknown make and model, a NEC PC-8201a portable computer, a USB keypad (brand unknown) and a [REDACTED]. Though incongruent, this last component is believed to be the primary source of SCP-281's anomalous properties. Attempts to reverse engineer it have thus far not yielded any significant results. SCP-281 is currently not believed to be functioning as designed.

SCP-281's effects become apparent when the following tasks are performed in the correct sequence:

1. Subject sets an alarm using the alarm clock interface

2. Subject sets the kitchen timer
 
3. Subject waits for the alarm to sound and presses the alarm clock's snooze button

The depression of the snooze button, triggers the creation of a localized temporal anomaly around SCP-281. The area affected is a spherical field with an approximate radius of six meters, centered on SCP-281 and designated SCP-281-1. Personnel and items outside this anomaly are not affected in any way. SCP-281 itself is somehow not affected by SCP-281-1. How the device creates the temporal anomaly and remains unaffected by SCP-281-1 is currently unknown.

Within SCP-281-1, time passes at an exponentially increased rate compared to that outside it. When set to x minutes, for each millisecond that lapses outside SCP-281-1, 2^^x^^ milliseconds lapse inside it. Any change in the amount of minutes left on the display then triggers a temporal deceleration event as the passage of time inside SCP-281-1 slows down to 2^^x-1^^ milliseconds for every millisecond that passes outside. When the timer reaches zero minutes and zero seconds, the alarm sounds again and time inside and outside of the instance of SCP-281-1 are resynchronized. While the seconds remaining on the timer are displayed on SCP-281's LED display and can be set, they do not seem to perform any function in its operation.

From the perspective of those inside the temporal anomaly, time moves at a normal rate while outside of SCP-281-1 time seems to be passing exponentially slower, effectively appearing to have stopped if SCP-281 has been set to a high enough number of minutes. Subjects within SCP-281-1 can move around within its limits, but attempts to have subjects cross from an active instance of SCP-281-1 into an area beyond its influence have invariably resulted in subjects undergoing acute and total cellular disruption along the line separating those parts inside and those outside of SCP-281-1. A similar effect has been observed on subjects and objects brought into an instance of SCP-281-1 from outside its area of effect. It has proven impossible to move SCP-281-1 by transporting SCP-281 to a different location while active, since attempting this would mean touching SCP-281, which itself is outside SCP-281-1. Any organic and inorganic material present within SCP-281-1 when the device is activated is subject to normal biological processes over the period of time that lapses inside SCP-281-1.

For those outside of SCP-281-1, all activity within the field appears greatly sped up. At high timer settings individual activity is indistinguishable, with any movement appearing as a rapid blur. As the amount of minutes left on the timer approaches zero, this effect lessens due to the temporal deceleration inside of SCP-281-1.

At lower timer settings, SCP-281 could potentially be of use to third party organizations, though its effects are still severely limiting due to the small amount of time subjects have before temporal resynchronization occurs. Due to the danger of SCP-281 being successfully reverse engineered and modified to remove its current limitations, the object has been classified Keter.

**Addendum 281-01:** On ██/██/20██ a remote monitoring station picked up encrypted transmissions emanating from a location in the █████████ Mountains. After decryption, the transmissions were found to be reporting progress on a project codenamed [REDACTED] and SCP-281 was secured by a Foundation airborne recovery team during a raid on a fortified hiker's cabin. It is currently unknown whether the device's creator, a 36 years old African American male identified post mortem as █████ █. ███████, is affiliated with any known GOI and/or terrorist organization. This matter is still under active investigation.
