**Item #:** SCP-4820

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4820 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment module at Site-17.  Up to 30 gallons of blood may be withdrawn from SCP-4820 in any given 24-hour period.  Withdrawal of larger amounts, or the harvesting of any of SCP-4820's organs, must be approved by at least one Level 4 Personnel.

--SCP-4820 need not be supplied with food, and refuses any offered to it.--  SCP-4820 has requested access to cooking implements, various spices, and a selection of sauces.  These requests have been granted on a probationary basis, and may be revoked as a disciplinary measure if the need arises.

**Description:** SCP-4820 is an adult Indonesian man, apparently 40-50 years of age.  The object is able to rapidly regenerate damaged or destroyed tissue.  These capabilities possess no known limit; SCP-4820 can even regrow appendages that have been completely severed[[footnote]]SCP-4820 claims that it once recovered from complete decapitation, although this has not been tested.[[/footnote]].  Regeneration time increases with the severity of the injury in question and the extent of the damage; minor incisions heal almost instantaneously, but extracted internal organs take several hours to regenerate.  SCP-4820 does not appear to feel pain, and often fails to notice when it is injured.

It is currently unknown how SCP-4820 fuels this rapid regeneration; it requires no more food or water than a standard human.

**Addendum 4820-1:**  Below is a sample of some of the tests performed on SCP-4820.

|| **INJURY ADMINISTERED** || **RESULT** || **NOTES** ||
|| A small incision, approximately 3 cm long, administered to the right arm. || Injury healed almost immediately. ||  ||
|| Left index finger severed at the first knuckle. || Finger regrew from the stump.  Simpler tissues regenerated first; first skin, then bone, then connective tissue, then muscles, and finally nerves.  The new finger did not initially possess a fingernail; one later grew at the normal rate for a human. || Cells in the severed finger died normally, and the severed member decayed as expected. ||
|| Left ring finger severed at the first knuckle.  SCP-4820 was instructed to attempt to reattach the severed member. || SCP-4820 attempted to reattach the severed finger by holding it to the stump.  Reattachment did not occur; new tissue had already begun developing, and would not reassimilate the severed finger. || ||
|| Left middle finger severed, wound cauterized. || The cauterized flesh rapidly reverted to its undamaged state, then began finger regeneration as normal. ||  ||
|| Left pinky finger severed, then sewn back on. || Finger did not reattach.  New tissue developed behind the sewn-on digit, forcibly tearing the old digit from the stitches as it grew. ||  ||
|| 30 gallons of blood extracted with a standard IV apparatus. || At no point during the procedure did SCP-4820 display a decrease in blood pressure or any other symptom of blood loss. || Extensive testing, including transfusion into D-Class test subjects, has shown no residual anomalies in extracted blood.  Long-term storage of large amounts of SCP-4820's blood in multiple on-Site blood banks has been approved, although usage of the blood on essential personnel is recommended only in case of emergencies. ||
|| Right kidney removed. || Subject regenerated a replacement kidney within 4 hours as expected. || The removed kidney was successfully transplanted into a D-Class test subject.  Extensive testing showed no residual anomalies in the recipient.  Usage of SCP-4820 as an emergency organ donor has been approved. ||
|| Right kidney removed, then replaced with a compatible kidney from a D-Class test subject before regeneration could complete. || SCP-4820's body did not accept the transplant.  The foreign kidney was completely destroyed by SCP-4820's immune system over the next 15 hours, at which time a new kidney regenerated as with the previous test. || ||
|| Stainless steel nail, .5 cm in diameter, driven through palm of left hand and left there. || Wound did not heal until the nail was removed. || SCP-4820 was distressed by this result. ||
|| Stainless steel spike, 1 cm in diameter, driven through the heart and left there. || Heart stopped beating and was unable to heal while the spike remained in place.  SCP-4820's cells began dying of hypoxia, then instantly regenerating.  The occurrence of this process in brain tissue caused SCP-4820 to seize uncontrollably until the spike was removed. || SCP-4820 has displayed no signs of brain damage, and its memories remain completely intact despite the death and regeneration of all its brain cells.  At SCP-4820's request, further testing of its regenerative capabilities has been suspended on the condition that it continues to cooperate by donating blood and serving as an organ donor if necessary. ||

//Yes, we could just tie him down and do whatever experiments we want, but regeneration is honestly nothing we haven't seen before in some form or another.  What makes him so useful is his utility as a blood and organ donor, and we'd like to keep him cooperative should that become necessary. -Dr. V█████.//

**Addendum 4820-2:**  Transcript of an interview between Dr. V█████ and SCP-4820, shortly after its initial containment.  Transcript has been translated from Indonesian, SCP-4820's preferred language.

> 
> <begin log>
> 
> **Dr. V█████:**  Good afternoon, SCP-4820.
> 
> **SCP-4820:**  Is that what you are going to call me now?
> 
> **Dr. V█████:**  Yes.  It's just the protocol, nothing personal.
> 
> **SCP-4820:**  Guess I'm not getting out of here any time soon, am I?
> 
> **Dr. V█████:**  I'm afraid not.
> 
> **SCP-4820:**  Oh well.  At least this place has people to talk to.  Not like [DATA EXPUNGED].
> 
> **Dr. V█████:**  The island you were stranded on?
> 
> **SCP-4820:**  If you can call that blasted pebble an island.
> 
> **Dr. V█████:**  It was certainly a hostile environment.  But you still survived on it for almost twelve years.  Care to explain how?
> 
> **SCP-4820:**  Well, at first I prayed for escape, like any right-minded shipwreck survivor would.  That was all I really wanted at first; I knew how to distill water, and there was a little cave where I could get out of the sun.
> 
> **Dr. V█████:**  What changed?
> 
> **SCP-4820:**  I got hungry!  [SCP-4820 laughs]  Escape got a whole lot less important after that.
> 
> **Dr. V█████:**  So what did you do?
> 
> **SCP-4820:**  I would have tried to catch some fish or something, but all I had to work with was a knife, some rocks, and one set of clothes.  I thought about taking my chances in the water, but decided I'd still be better off starving in a cave than trying to swim all the way back home in open water.  So I crawled down to the very back of that little cave, where it was nice and dark and cool, and prayed for something to eat.
> 
> **Dr. V█████:**  And that's when you developed your anomalous properties?
> 
> **SCP-4820:**  Yes.  I passed out back there - because I was exhausted - and then when I woke up I noticed all my cuts and bruises were gone.  I got hurt pretty bad when the ship went down but now all that had healed.  And it wasn't just those; all my scars were gone, too.  Even my calluses had disappeared.
> 
> **Dr. V█████:**  What did you do when you realized this?
> 
> **SCP-4820:**  I thought I'd stayed in the sun too long.  I would've cut myself to make sure if I'd had something sharp, but I'd left my knife outside, so I just picked a hand and bit down.  Watched it heal right back up.
> 
> **Dr. V█████:**  Then what did you do?
> 
> [SCP-4820 smiles]
> 
> **SCP-4820:**  What any sailor does when he's stranded on a barren island with only one food source.

**Addendum 4820-3:**  List of materials recovered from [DATA EXPUNGED] with SCP-4820.
* 1 metal survival knife, rusted and dulled to the point of uselessness
* 2 knives carved from a human tibia
* 2 shirts and 2 pairs of pants, consisting of human skin sewn together with sinew and hair
* 1 needle, carved from an unidentified human bone
* 1 set of chess pieces; the "white" side is carved from various fingerbones, while "black" side is carved from toes
* A crude shelter constructed of human skin and a single large piece of driftwood
* Approximately 4,000 human teeth, piled neatly outside a cave entrance.

**Addendum 4820-4:**  Transcript of a second interview conducted with SCP-4820, the day following its recovery.

> 
> <begin log>
> 
> **Dr. V█████:**  Good morning, SCP-4820.
> 
> **SCP-4820:**  Hello, doctor.  What's new?
> 
> **Dr. V█████:**  I'm here to ask you some questions about the time you spent on [DATA EXPUNGED].
> 
> **SCP-4820:**  Sure.
> 
> **Dr. V█████:**  We've recovered the materials you, ah, made.  How did you do that?
> 
> **SCP-4820:**  Simple enough.  I still had my knife at the beginning, so I was able to do some carving.  First I made a new one out of bone, because metal doesn't typically last too long around all that salt water.
> 
> **Dr. V█████:**  Right.
> 
> **SCP-4820:**  Then I made a net, because I was hoping to add some variety to my diet.
> 
> **Dr. V█████:**  We didn't find a net on the island.
> 
> **SCP-4820:**  Of course not.  Once I finally made one that would hold together, it didn't do me any good.  I hadn't noticed until then, but all the animals avoided that island like the plague.  The birds wouldn't even fly over it.
> 
> **Dr. V█████:**  Why not?
> 
> **SCP-4820:**  Best I can figure, they could feel there was something wrong.  Something...off.  I felt it too, sometimes.  Maybe it was whatever sick genie gave me this gift.  Whatever lived in that cave.
> 
> **Dr. V█████:**  There was an entity in the cave?
> 
> **SCP-4820:**  Maybe not an entity, but a presence at least.  Something very old.  Something very different from you and me.  Spooked me if I thought about it too much, but it saved my life that night, so I didn't complain.  Still didn't sleep in the cave after that, though.
> 
> **Dr. V█████:**  But you did leave a pile of teeth outside it.
> 
> **SCP-4820:**  Had to keep track of the days somehow, right?  I've always had really loose teeth.  Must be genetic or something, or I wouldn't anymore[[footnote]]Testing has not identified any genetic abnormalities that would explain SCP-4820's loose teeth.[[/footnote]].  So, in the absence of any real writing materials, I decided I'd use them to keep track of the days.  I ripped one out every day at dawn.
> 
> **Dr. V█████:**  But why did you decide to pile them outside the cave?
> 
> [SCP-4820 appears confused.]
> 
> **SCP-4820:**  Not really sure.  Guess I figured a little offering couldn't hurt.  [SCP-4820 chuckles nervously]
> 
> <end log>

**Addendum 4820-5:**  Exploration of [DATA EXPUNGED].  The island of [DATA EXPUNGED], located approximately ██ km northeast of Java, has a land area of slightly less than one square kilometer at low tide.  At high tide, only a few hundred square meters remain above water.  No animals and very few plants (none of which are edible) can be found on the island; its surface is little more than barren stone.  The island's only notable feature is an irregular cave entrance approximately 1 meter high and 1.5 meters wide, located near the highest point of the terrain and opening to the south.  The entrance allows passage into an elliptical cave, roughly 2 meters wide at its widest point, 2.3 meters high at its highest, and 3 meters deep.  Thorough inspection of the cave revealed no anomalous qualities, although personnel did report a “bad feeling”.

**Addendum 4820-6:**  Portion of the third interview with SCP-4820, conducted █ weeks after initial containment.

> 
> <begin log>
> 
> **Dr. V█████:**  Hello again, SCP-4820.
> 
> **SCP-4820:**  Hey, doc.  Say, do you guys have any //sambal//[[footnote]]A pepper and seafood-based sauce frequently used in Indonesian cuisine.[[/footnote]]?
> 
> **Dr. V█████:**  I can file a request for some if you like.
> 
> **SCP-4820:**  Please.  I taste better with seasoning.
> 
> **Dr. V█████:**  Yes, well, that's actually why I'm here.  To discuss your refusal to accept rations.
> 
> **SCP-4820:**  What about it?
> 
> **Dr. V█████:**  Well, we expected that you'd be eager to, uh, inject some more variety into your diet.
> 
> **SCP-4820:**  That's what the //sambal// is for.
> 
> **Dr. V█████:**  But why do you still insist on consuming your, uh, self?
> 
> **SCP-4820:**  Doctor, have you ever spent twelve years completely alone?  Don't answer that, I know you haven't.  When a man's alone for that long, he has to latch onto something, an anchor, if you will, so he doesn't go completely nuts.  Some men write books.  Some play chess.  Me?  I had this.  [SCP-4820 breaks its right index finger, then watches as it heals.]  Infinite healing.  Not immortality, though.  I still had to eat.  My flesh always grew back, but if I didn't eat I would starve.  So I ate the only food I had, myself.  How many times did I consume myself, recycle the nutrients back into more flesh before eating it again?  It was a cycle.  A perfect circle, even.  I had become the entire food chain.  I had become //everything//.  So that's what I latched on to.  That circle.  It became holy to me.  Sacred.  And that hasn't changed just because I'm off the island.  I think I experienced God out there, in a way.  How it felt to be God, eternally eating and being eaten, the beginning and end of everything.  And it was a good feeling.
