Hello! It's me, pastarasta1! I love drawing cartoonish stuff. You might remember me from that old art page I did a year ago. Well, I'm back and better then ever! 

Things you may notice when compared to my old art page include...

> - all pieces are now 100% more slimy 
> - my skin now secretes mucous 
> - point 1 and 2 are unrelated
> - **aAAAAHRHHHGHHHHHHHHHHAHHHHRRRGHHHAHAAAAGHHH**
> - my art got better [citation needed]
> - do you want to be my citation? ðŸ˜³
> - [http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-12238995/the-pastarasta1-art-page-experience-rise-of-the-revenge-of-r#post-4310091 citation found..........]
> - i was serious about point 1 and 2 being unrelated please
> - bro please
> - thanks! check out my art! enjoy it and share it with your family except you probably shouldn't show my drawings to your family its not a good decision you gonna have to explain a bunch of shit and you know thats just hard you know thats just how parents are you know you kn

Basically, this will be a more streamlined version of my art page, where I only add art that I put a bit more time or thought into. Enjoy!
