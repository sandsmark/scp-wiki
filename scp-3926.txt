**Item #:** SCP-3926

**Item Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3926 has no traceable broadcasting location and cannot be brought into Foundation custody. Containment of SCP-3926 is focused on interrupting broadcasts. Members of MTF Upsilon-46 "Serial Listeners" are to observe local TV channels in centers of population previously affected by SCP-3926 broadcasts and interrupt them if deemed anomalous.

Under no circumstances is an episode of //Saturday Evenings with your host, Tyal'k'nec!// to be played onsite by anyone other than MTF Upsilon-46.

One subject affected by SCP-3926 (SCP-3926-1) is to be kept in a standard 7m by 7m humanoid containment cell for testing purposes.

If SCP-3926-1 begin to organize and attempt to achieve the goals stated in SCP-3926, violent response is necessary. Standard Foundation cover story ATY-3███ (Mass rioting) is to be used as an explanation.

**Item Description:** SCP-3926 is an anomalous TV talk show dubbed //Saturday Evenings with your host, Tyal'k'nec!// hosted by a reptilian humanoid, referred to as Tyal'k'nec. Tyal'k'nec has been described by viewers as "charismatic", "humorous", "caring", and "loving".  The set of SCP-3926 is standard with other low-budget TV talk shows. SCP-3926 is filmed live with a studio audience of SCP-3926-1. Camera quality is very low, with recording equipment likely being from the 1980s.

SCP-3926 broadcasts follow a set pattern. Tyal'k'nec begins to talk about issues in the world. Tyal'k'nec's "issues" have to do with humans as a species. The audience will show that they agree. For the rest of the broadcast, Tyal'k'nec will "preach" about itself and how it must gain influence and power. It will finish the broadcast by asking the audience the "Three Goals". The audience will then shout back "CULTIVATE! CONGLOMERATE! SUBJUGATE!"  (See Addendum-1)

Human subjects who view 3 or more SCP-3926 broadcasts will begin to sympathize with Tyal'k'nec. Transfer to SCP-3926-1 occurs 12-14 hours after viewing 3 or more SCP-3926 broadcasts. SCP-3926-1 will respond violently to other humans who speak poorly about Tyal'k'nec. Humans in stage 1 of SCP-3926-1 are still genetically human, the only difference being the support for Tyal'k'nec and its goals.

After 3-5 days of being in stage 1 of SCP-3926-1, subjects will begin to "molt", beginning stage 2. A bed is made from phlegm and other bodily fluids excreted from SCP-3926-1's mouth. SCP-3926-1 will lay down in this bed, assume the fetal position, and begin shivering. In a varying amount of time, the subject will shed their human skin. The final product of SCP-3926-1's evolution is a pale green humanoid, lacking facial features and genitalia. SCP-3926-1 in stage 2 are violent and dangerous, and will blindly attack anyone determined to be a threat to Tyal'k'nec.

As of 3/██/████, ██ instances of armed riots by SCP-3926-1 have been recorded, resulting in $█████ dollars of property damage and ██ Foundation personnel deaths.

> Addendum-1: Transcription of Episode 39 of __//Saturday Evenings with your host, Tyal'k'nec!//__

> **Tyal'k'nec:** Hello, my children, and welcome to another episode of Saturday Evenings! As always, I'm your host, Tyal'k'nec!
> 
> [wild applause from SCP-3926-1]
> 
> **Tyal'k'nec:** Alright now, calm down everyone! We've got serious issues to discuss.
> 
> [Tyal'k'nec stands up and walks to the front of the stage, pulls out sheet of paper and clears throat]
> 
> **Tyal'k'nec:** There's a big problem in this world. I think you all know what I'm gonna say it is. It's those bastard bipedals. Those pestiferous people. Those horrible humans! It's always them. For years and years, they've tried and tried and tried to lead their pathetic countries and kingdoms, but somehow they always mess it up. They'll blame the weather. They'll blame other people's ideas. They'll even blame their GOD! Their god, people! But, do you know what they haven't considered as a cause for their problems?
> 
> **SCP-3926-1 in unison:** HUMANITY!
> 
> **Tyal'k'nec:** Preee-cisely! HUMANITY! This is why I DESER- no, NEED to be at the helm here. You there. [points to member of audience] Let's talk about America. My country tis of thee, right? Tell me what you think about the President.
> 
> **Member of SCP-3926-1:** Well, personally, I think that he's simple.
> 
> **Tyal'k'nec:** There it is. Right there. Simple. That's all anyone is anymore. Simple. What humanity needs is a guy like me. And guys like you! All of you!
> 
> [Tyal'k'nec sits back at the desk]
> 
> **Tyal'k'nec:** To my new listeners, you may be asking yourself, "Why am I worthy of Tyal'k'nec's grace? What have I done to earn His voice? His unwavering light?" And the simple answer is, you're not worthy. YET! All you have to do to join me in eternity is tune in next week! Undergo your pilgrimage from your meager human form to the image that I, Tyal'k'nec created for you! Bask in my light. Feel my inviting fluids. Know what it is to be perfect. I know, I know. You're thinking, "This is a lot to take in." But I swear, once you abandon your chains and take my hand, all will be well.
> 
> [audience clicks in approval]
> 
> **Tyal'k'nec:** Now audience, my dearest audience, that audience that I hold so dear, I've got three things that we have to do and three things only. Can you remind me what they are?
> 
> **SCP-3926-1 in unison:** CULTIVATE! CONGLOMERATE! SUBJUGATE!
> 
> [camera pans out as all cheer, outro rolls and fades to black]
