You scan Alces figure before asking a question.

> "Morse code... I assume you're also curious about what it is too. Originally, it was supposed to be a funny article about a carabiner that was arrogant. The original I thought of would've been a climber that turned into a carabiner. Now though, it's a carabiner who's just trying to have people remember his last owner in the best way. Really and honestly, Uncle Nicolini, another wildish author who you can find shitposting around here, is the one who helped me through this entire process."

> "Once again, a sad article that was meant to be funny. To be honest, I'm somewhat shocked as to how something called "Craydaddy," is on main. I got the idea when I rescued a crayfish. He was in a defensive stance that looked like a stereotypical rapper. I kept laughing and laughing until, I realized, that this would be a great article. Now, here we are talking about it."

> "Twine man, many things. My first collab, the second thing I wrote, a piece griping about the mice in my barn... In the end, I think that Zyn, the butterfly you just hit with it, was who helped mold it out. She gave me a critique on forums to which I tore down all of its dialogue and then rebuilt it from the start to make 4016 mute... She liked it and wanted to collab. We got right to work and sure enough, it was ready to post in, what like, two days? I think?"
