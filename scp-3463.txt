**Item #:** SCP-3463

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3463 is to be contained in a standard secure locker. Personnel not responsible for its containment are not allowed to know of SCP-3463. Documentation concerning SCP-3463 must be guarded with a password. Personnel assigned to SCP-3463 must have scored less than ten points on the Test of Manipulative Personality Traits. Personnel with speech impairment, dyslexia or improper handwriting are prohibited from accessing SCP-3463.

**Description:** SCP-3463 is a 60cm tall "National" brand blue fan primarily composed of plastic and iron. Its physical form does not possess any anomalous traits. 

The primary anomalous effects of SCP-3463 are triggered as follows: If an individual says or writes a statement about SCP-3463, the person reading or hearing the information automatically believes that it is correct, even if the new information presented is impossible. The creator of the statement is immune to the cognitohazard. Even if an individual is conscious of SCP-3463's effects, they are incapable of doubting any information regarding it.

Information about SCP-3463 cannot be forgotten without the use of amnestics, but its effects on an individual can be replaced by other infomation which contradicts it. After approximately five years, the effect triggered by SCP-3463 disappears.

**__Test/3463:__**
> **Interviewed:** D-8956
> 
> **Interviewer:** Dr Y██
> 
> **Procedure:** D-8956 is interrogated by Dr Y██ in a soundproof room. Dr Y██ creates and says falsehoods about SCP-3463 to test its effects on human beings. The D-Class is monitored with a lie detector to see if he believes information made by Dr Y██ about SCP-3463 or is just faking his trust.
> 
> **<Begin Log>**
> 
> **Dr Y██:** Hello D-8956, can you describe SCP-3463 in detail.
> 
> **D-8956:** Well, hum... according to your papers, it's a blue fan.
> 
> **Dr Y██:** It's actually a red fan.
> 
> **D-8956:** Oh... alright.
> 
> **Dr Y██:** Who murdered your family? Was it you?
> 
> **D-8956:** I'm tired of this. If I didn't kill them then why the hell did they place me here? You already know the answer. I don't need to spell it out.
> 
> **Dr Y██:** Actually, SCP-3463 is the one who did it.
> 
> **D-8956:** Oh my god! That monster! How could you?
> 
> **Dr Y██:** Test successful. Ending the interview.
> 
> **<End Log>**
> 
> **Closing Statement:** //The heart rate monitor never beeped during the interview. It's actually very impressive.//
> ~Dr Y██

[[footnote]]The object did not murder D-8956's family, nor is it red. It is in fact, blue.[[/footnote]]

[[collapsible show="+ Show Update Log" hide="- Hide Update Log"]]

**Update Log:** Dr J███, an ex-employee from the brand "National" once told "All previous information about SCP-3463 is false" to Dr Y██. His theory was verified. Every previous document about SCP-3463 have been erased to prevent confusion and the spread of false infohazardous information. The description and the special containment procedures have been altered. SCP-3463 is now considered as a fan and not a [DATA CORRUPTED]. Dr J███ was promoted for his important contributions.

**Description:** SCP-3463 is a five decimeters tall brown male specimen from the mallard duck specie weighing approximately one kilogram. Its physical form does not possess any anomalous traits or behaviors for its specie.

Any sentence said about SCP-3463 is true to anyone reading or hearing it despite lack of evidence or evidence opposing the statement. The individual is immune to his statement unless another individual repeats it to him.

**Update Log:**

> After much thought and reflection, I have decided that the containment of SCP-3463 should be not carried out by the O5 Council but instead by a select group of personnel chosen by the council, such as before iteration #██. An anomalous duck is simply not worth our time and effort.

[DATA NOT FOUND]

[[collapsible show="+ Open Version #1" hide="- Close Version #1"]]
**Item #:** SCP-3463

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Documentation concerning SCP-3463 is to be guarded with a password.
Personnel assigned to SCP-3463 must have scored less than ten points on the Test of Manipulative Personality Traits, must not have dyslexia, dysgraphia, agraphia or speech impairment and are required to possess 20/20 vision. When reporting on SCP-3463, metaphors and comparisons are forbidden.

**Description:** SCP-3463 is a memetic thought which spreads and evolves through verbal and written human communication and interaction. Any statement made by an individual about SCP-3463 sounds true to anyone listening to the individual even when there is an absence of evidence or logic in the individual's statement. The individual is not affected by their own use of the statement, but is affected if the statement is repeated by someone else. Even if an individual is conscious of SCP-3463's effects, they are incapable of doubting it.

Information about SCP-3463 cannot be forgotten without the uses of amnestics but its effects on an individual can be replaced by another statement about SCP-3463 which contradicts the previous one. The effect of SCP-3463 disappears after approximately five years.

SCP-3463 has been confirmed to be aware of the Foundation's existence due to the entity corresponding to the name of SCP-3463 during its time of discovery and research.

**Discovery Log:** SCP-3463 was found after Dr K█████ was speaking to Dr R███ about the previously empty SCP-3463 entry. He discovered that Dr R███ would believe any statement concerning SCP-3463. He experimented on subjects to confirm his belief and he was correct about the existence of the anomaly.

**Notes:**

> Since SCP-3463 is only a meme that thrives on human error, we can only count on ourselves this time. There's no technology to contain it, only us. Any lie or mistake we make will cost us the truth. We cannot let our guard down.
> 
> ~ Dr L████

> After years of research, we have come up with a hypothesis which may reveal the intent of SCP-3463. SCP-3463 interacts with human thoughts and false depictions of itself as if it wanted to be real. As if SCP-3463 demands to exist in our physical realm but cannot. It is only a thought. However, SCP-3463 is intelligent. It understands that our knowledge of reality is only limited to what our flawed perception of it can provide us.
> This is why any statement said or written about SCP-3463 becomes true for its viewer or hearer. Anything will suffice for SCP-3463, anything that may be derogatory or complementary. As long as it is more than a thought in the human mind, it is satisfied. Yet in reality it always remains the same object.
