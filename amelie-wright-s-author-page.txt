//My wife whose hair is a brush fire//
//Whose thoughts are summer lightning//
//Whose waist is an hourglass//
//Whose waist is the waist of an otter caught in the teeth of a tiger//
//Whose mouth is a bright cockade with the fragrance of a star of the first magnitude//
//Whose teeth leave prints like the tracks of white mice over snow//
//Whose tongue is made out of amber and polished glass//
//Whose tongue is a stabbed wafer//
//The tongue of a doll with eyes that open and shut//
//Whose tongue is an incredible stone//
//My wife whose eyelashes are strokes in the handwriting of a child//
//Whose eyebrows are nests of swallows//
//My wife whose temples are the slate of greenhouse roofs//
//With steam on the windows//
//My wife whose shoulders are champagne//
//Are fountains that curl from the heads of dolphins over the ice//
//My wife whose wrists are matches//
//Whose fingers are raffles holding the ace of hearts//
//Whose fingers are fresh cut hay//
//My wife with the armpits of martens and beech fruit//
//And Midsummer Night//
//That are hedges of privet and resting places for sea snails//
//Whose arms are of sea foam and a landlocked sea
And a fusion of wheat and a mill//
//Whose legs are spindles//
//In the delicate movements of watches and despair//
//My wife whose calves are sweet with the sap of elders//
//Whose feet are carved initials//
//Keyrings and the feet of steeplejacks//
//My wife whose neck is fine milled barley//
//Whose throat contains the Valley of God//
//And encounters in the bed of the maelstrom//
//My wife whose breasts are of night//
—
//And are undersea molehills//
//And crucibles of rubies//
//My wife whose breasts are haunted by the ghosts of dew-moistened roses//
//Whose belly is a fan unfolded in the sunlight
Is a giant talon//
//My wife with the back of a bird in vertical flight
With a back of quicksilver//
//And bright lights//
//My wife whose nape is of smooth worn stone and white chalk//
//And of a glass slipped through the fingers of someone who has just drunk//
//My wife with the thighs of a skiff//
//That are lustrous and feathered like arrows//
//Stemmed with the light tailbones of a white peacock//
//And imperceptible balance//
//My wife whose rump is sandstone and flax//
//Whose rump is the back of a swan and the spring//
//My wife with the sex of an iris//
//A mine and a platypus//
//With the sex of an alga and old-fashioned candles//
//My wife with the sex of a mirror//
//My wife with eyes full of tears//
//With eyes that are purple armour and a magnetized needle//
//With eyes of savannahs//
//With eyes full of water to drink in prisons//
//My wife with eyes that are forests forever under the axe//
//My wife with eyes that are the equal of water and air and earth and fire//

My name is Amélie. As of writing, I am a twenty-one year old trans girl. I'm a lesbian and a leftist. I'm a quiet person. I enjoy books and film over people, and I like cold, quiet, overcast, rainy days. Especially when its snowing, and I have a good cup of tea. I love people too. I work with seniors, and in the future I'm wanting to work in Social Work. I paint, write, and a dream of mine is writing classical music, and film. Not for a while, but I'm confident in saying that I'll happen, someday. Definitely not tomorrow, but definitely someday.

My writing style is influenced by stream of consciousness writing, nihilism, absurdism, and especially magical realism. My favorite authors- Samuel Beckett, Gabriel García Márquez, André Breton, Haruki Murakami, Harlan Ellison, have all been big influences on me. I'm somewhat agnostic, but I also draw a lot from religious settings. 

Aside from SCPS, a couple of literary goals for me include writing a play, a collection of short stories, a poetry cycle, and an opera liberetto. All of this is going to be a long time coming, but it's nice having goals, something to work for.

[[tab Bell for a Funeral]]
http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4551

This was my first published SCP, and I think it really shows. I'm proud of it from a historical point of view, in that as reading this site was a huge part of my teenage years, and finally being able to post something and have it stick on the wiki was something I never thought I could do back then, and even when I was writing this, I admit, I had my doubts.

This SCP sets into motion a GOI I'm working on, a small Scottish community were the anomalous is used in everyday life. It was something of an excuse for me to practice writing magic realism, one of my favorite genres.

[[tab The Lovers]]
http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4418

This is what I like to refer to as my first 'real' SCP. I find the dialogue and descriptions better written, the concept more original, and the premise more realistic, without a bunch of unneeded things tacked onto it to justify this and that. I had a lot of fun writing this one, and it was partially based upon my Grandfather, who lived in the same community that the photo was taken from.

[[tab As the Forest Grows, Sweetly.]]
http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-5523

This was written for the second bracket of JamCon. Again, like 4418, I'm rather happy with this. It's short and simple, and creates imagery that's half-way between creepy and beautiful. Or at least, from my view.

This article marks the English usage of the Terminal class, which was originally used only in the Spanish Wikis. I really like esoteric classes, if it wasn't clear.

[[tab Take Care of Yourself.]]
http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-5699

This is my favorite article. I wrote it late at night, after work. I was feeling shitty about myself, and I wrote this as a reminder to myself that there's good in everyone, and that I myself have done well. 

I'm humbled by the positive response, and the emotional connection it made with certain readers. I really appreciate it.

+ ONE MORE FINAL: I need you.

This is a collection of my photography. They're available to use on site, but please ask first. These aren't connected to any SCP, but I had a lot of fun taking these photos.
