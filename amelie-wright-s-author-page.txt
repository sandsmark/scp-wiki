//My wife whose hair is a brush fire//
//Whose thoughts are summer lightning//
//Whose waist is an hourglass//
//Whose waist is the waist of an otter caught in the teeth of a tiger//
//Whose mouth is a bright cockade with the fragrance of a star of the first magnitude//
//Whose teeth leave prints like the tracks of white mice over snow//
//Whose tongue is made out of amber and polished glass//
//Whose tongue is a stabbed wafer//
//The tongue of a doll with eyes that open and shut//
//Whose tongue is an incredible stone//
//My wife whose eyelashes are strokes in the handwriting of a child//
//Whose eyebrows are nests of swallows//
//My wife whose temples are the slate of greenhouse roofs//
//With steam on the windows//
//My wife whose shoulders are champagne//
//Are fountains that curl from the heads of dolphins over the ice//
//My wife whose wrists are matches//
//Whose fingers are raffles holding the ace of hearts//
//Whose fingers are fresh cut hay//
//My wife with the armpits of martens and beech fruit//
//And Midsummer Night//
//That are hedges of privet and resting places for sea snails//
//Whose arms are of sea foam and a landlocked sea
And a fusion of wheat and a mill//
//Whose legs are spindles//
//In the delicate movements of watches and despair//
//My wife whose calves are sweet with the sap of elders//
//Whose feet are carved initials//
//Keyrings and the feet of steeplejacks//
//My wife whose neck is fine milled barley//
//Whose throat contains the Valley of God//
//And encounters in the bed of the maelstrom//
//My wife whose breasts are of night//
—
//And are undersea molehills//
//And crucibles of rubies//
//My wife whose breasts are haunted by the ghosts of dew-moistened roses//
//Whose belly is a fan unfolded in the sunlight
Is a giant talon//
//My wife with the back of a bird in vertical flight
With a back of quicksilver//
//And bright lights//
//My wife whose nape is of smooth worn stone and white chalk//
//And of a glass slipped through the fingers of someone who has just drunk//
//My wife with the thighs of a skiff//
//That are lustrous and feathered like arrows//
//Stemmed with the light tailbones of a white peacock//
//And imperceptible balance//
//My wife whose rump is sandstone and flax//
//Whose rump is the back of a swan and the spring//
//My wife with the sex of an iris//
//A mine and a platypus//
//With the sex of an alga and old-fashioned candles//
//My wife with the sex of a mirror//
//My wife with eyes full of tears//
//With eyes that are purple armour and a magnetized needle//
//With eyes of savannahs//
//With eyes full of water to drink in prisons//
//My wife with eyes that are forests forever under the axe//
//My wife with eyes that are the equal of water and air and earth and fire//

[[/=]]

My name is Amélie. As of writing, I am a twenty-two year old trans girl. I'm a lesbian and a leftist. I'm a quiet person. I enjoy books and film over people, and I like cold, quiet, overcast, rainy days. Especially when its snowing, and I have a good cup of tea. I love people too. I work with seniors, and in the future I'm wanting to work in Social Work. I paint, write, and a dream of mine is writing classical music, and film. Not for a while, but I'm confident in saying that I'll happen, someday. Definitely not tomorrow, but definitely someday.

My writing style is influenced by stream of consciousness writing, nihilism, absurdism, and especially magical realism. My favorite authors- Samuel Beckett, Gabriel García Márquez, André Breton, Haruki Murakami, Harlan Ellison, have all been big influences on me. I'm somewhat agnostic, but I also draw a lot from religious settings. 

Aside from SCPS, a couple of literary goals for me include writing a play, a collection of short stories, a poetry cycle, and an opera liberetto. All of this is going to be a long time coming, but it's nice having goals, something to work for.

[[tab Bell for a Funeral]]
http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4551

This was my first published SCP, and I think it really shows. I'm proud of it from a historical point of view, in that as reading this site was a huge part of my teenage years, and finally being able to post something and have it stick on the wiki was something I never thought I could do back then, and even when I was writing this, I admit, I had my doubts.

This SCP sets into motion a GOI I'm working on, a small Scottish community were the anomalous is used in everyday life. It was something of an excuse for me to practice writing magic realism, one of my favorite genres.

[[tab The Lovers]]
http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4418

This is what I like to refer to as my first 'real' SCP. I find the dialogue and descriptions better written, the concept more original, and the premise more realistic, without a bunch of unneeded things tacked onto it to justify this and that. I had a lot of fun writing this one, and it was partially based upon my Grandfather, who lived in the same community that the photo was taken from.

[[tab As the Forest Grows, Sweetly.]]
http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-5523

This was written for the second bracket of JamCon. Again, like 4418, I'm rather happy with this. It's short and simple, and creates imagery that's half-way between creepy and beautiful. Or at least, from my view.

This article marks the English usage of the Terminal class, which was originally used only in the Spanish Wikis. I really like esoteric classes, if it wasn't clear.

[[tab Take Care of Yourself.]]
http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-5699

This is my favorite article. I wrote it late at night, after work. I was feeling shitty about myself, and I wrote this as a reminder to myself that there's good in everyone, and that I myself have done well. 

I'm humbled by the positive response, and the emotional connection it made with certain readers. I really appreciate it.

+ ONE MORE FINAL: I need you.

This is a collection of my photography. They're available to use on site, and released under CC. 3.00 These aren't connected to any SCP, but I had a lot of fun taking these photos.

+ Weaving a Story
[[/=]]

A collection of various poems. Inspired by free-verse, stream of consciousness writing, especially Bréton's Magnetic Fields, in which qoutations are borrowed. Both Bréton's work and mine are in the Public Domain.



[[div class="poem"]]
Oh, how sweet the fruit is from the Moon's sweet carcass, as if harvested from the giant maw of a bee stung beast
Mandibles dripping wet with honeysuckle
Flung away, far off things, abandoned by the old men, who had watched by the sea shore - as the beast rose to height
Devouring the remains of the flesh to the sun
As the world men watched
Eating honey in the rain.

[[/div]]



[[div class="poem"]]
It was the end of sorrow. The end of lies. Haggard women walked through the deserted carriages shouting, Hath! Hath the emperor laughs! How could he have laughed!

The haggard carriagewomen saw in the half-light, the shadowed corpse of the grey woman; holding her palm up toward the black landscape. Her waist is strongly canted. Her forehead is wrinkled. It looks sullen. Its half-human, half-possessed, posionedbface – mouth half-ocean – has all of the features of the emperor's gun-man, shooting black-fire 

On the day, as the nursewoman flee the carriage, laughing in the ashen soot, gunpowder and foggy day-light that came down from the country. Emperors don't admire themselves alone with mirror glass. They admire their troops! The bullets! The more war they enjoy, more that is fought- the more victories they win! The more astride their monstrous formed chariots, the more glorious their trumpets, hawking a victory! Oh, for the end of sorrow- wake the emperor up, and kiss the haggard carriagewomen.

[[div class="poem"]]
St. Mary clutches her breast, looking down at the blue azure sky, cerulean waves crashing upon her hazel eyes, golden cross, green fringes.Blue fishes, singing the soul of the Lord and god. Mary, her soul a' blaze with eggs of white

Another girl- Mildred, laying her dear, true and jest-like babes, across lost lost hair-worm's nest, singing to her 

King, his soul a' lustre-reared to the altar
Floating in his swan's breast
Cried with bewailing and rambling fervour
Jesus, in his expression and name
He stands, for every eye, in every beholder,
For every face in all the world. He stands
And speaks, in eloquent eloquence
That most heavenly doctrine of peace,
That men's hearts should be moved

Says Mary, sweet of the soul
Upon the breast of Mildred rose
Bring new world
Into flesh above
Free from your jaw.

[[div class="poem"]]
Oh, on the dreary days of blue leaves suckled by the tiger's great breasts, dropped with the soul of honeydew-laden coyote,

Only recalled to me the moving figure — the snow-blue wings, blue eyes. Here was the blades of the grass days

Let me look at the days of grassen-blue and so I can

Talk to you

Feel you

Hug you

Kiss the tiger's maw

Understand you

Cock-a crow, three times in the darkest hour

Singing our song- 

As we sung, and danced and sing joy
Clouds of chlorine dioxide flood our lungs
Suffocatingly bright
But that pales in the moments we shared
Together
Right?
As I 

Talks to you

Felt you

Hugged you

Kissed the tiger's maw

Understood you

Although I ask, that we could still be together, in health fair, breathing in days of grassen-blue dropped with the soul of honeydew-laden tiger's eye.

[[/div]]

[[div class="poem"]]
The war outside is raging and it is already lost. On to victory!

Yet you with steel guns and roses
Continue the losing fight
As if a thorn-covered beast
Stung with honey and lead
Will not come to the surface,
But still dies at night, 
Like summer fires on ancient deserts
And in death, one will find the bullets 
Dug out of the rosary-woman's temple
Crushed by the jaws of a great tiger in the heavens
And you will ask to fight again.

[[/div]]

[[div class="poem"]]
A traveler stops,
You've reached out to me
Haven't you
With the carcass of the moonlight
Falling snow into my soul
As the war rages
Across the papers, 'ruined streets of
Sarajevo',
The bomb in Myanmar
The clouds of aqauamarine haze under the disheveled roads of London
The triumphs over the war-men
To create after war
To forget and let old wounds heal
Let there be joy.
So
Join us.
Won't you
Or at least
Remember us.
