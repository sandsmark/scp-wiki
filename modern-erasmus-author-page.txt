Hello and welcome to my author page! I first discovered the Foundation in late 2016, and have been a huge fan ever since. Since you're here, feel free to check out my body of work. I hope you enjoy!

I'm also a Junior Staff member attached to the forum crit team (and the wikiwalk team too). If you ever want a draft critiqued, just shoot me a message.

**Tales:**
None yet, but I have several plans:
* A series of tales about MTF Omega-12 from SCP-3480.
* A tale about the 3602 monkeys trying to rewrite their names into the register of death.
* Possible tales about Kektagon and GAW.
* Maybe writing for Ressurection at some point?

**Other Stuff:**
* Wrote log 012 for the [[[SCP-3301 Testing Log]]].

**Author's Thoughts:**

[[[SCP-3480 |SCP-3480 - Olympus Mons]]]
Oddly enough, this was originally inspired by a random pic of Olympus that was posted to r/europe. For some reason, it inspired me to take the leap and write a skip about Olympus, joining this fine community of writers. 

The exact process of plotting this one out was messy, but in the end I'm very happy with it. Also serves as a nice homage to SCP-2000, my personal favorite skip. I'm quite happy that my first skip did relatively well, and considering I did a major re-write a few weeks after the initial post I'm confident it could have done even better. I chose the number to reference the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 BC.

[[[SCP-3108|SCP-3108- The Nerfing Gun]]]
This is a light article I wrote based on a discussion Lefarsi and I were having in an SCP discord. It started off as a collab, but unfortunately Lefarsi had to stop due to irl business.

I had a hell of a time finishing this. I actually posted it once and self deleted, before doing a re-write. Connecting it to GAW happened pretty late in the process, but I think it wound up working well. 108 doesn't have any special significance for this skip, but it is my favorite number.

[[[SCP-3602 |SCP-3602- The Monkey King's Legacy]]]
After I scrapped a long and disastrous draft about a Sealand-based skip, I decided to write something more simple. Inspired by my love of Chinese culture and Journey to the West, I decided to write about a loose end from the novel: the monkeys that Wukong made immortal before leaving them to become a Buddha with Xuanzang.

I'm happy with how it turned out. Ultimately, the ideas expressed were not anything revolutionary, but I think I executed a simple tale about immortality and abandonment quite well. The number 3602 was chosen to reference Xuanzang's birth year, and thus the individual who would deprive the monkeys of their king.

[[collapsible show="+SCP-3051- Revenge of the Human Rights Lobbyists" hide="-Hide"]]
[[[SCP-3051 |SCP-3051- Revenge of the Human Rights Lobbyists]]]
This skip was heavily inspired by the frustrations I've experienced working as a irl human rights lobbyists. Since Manna didn't have my restrictions, I can only assume they would show legislators the suffering they cause, as that is what I always wish I could do when I'm trapped in a meeting with the apathetic cretins.

Fun fact, the manna official was named after an irl boss of mine in the ngo. The number has so special significance save the fact that 3108 was originally posted to this slot, so since it was still open I decided to return it to my possession.

**About Me**
I'm a very activism focused guy finishing up college. I work for Amnesty International as a regional youth organizer and legislative coordinator (titled but unpaid). I've written amateur poetry for a long time but this is my first time really writing fiction.

My interests include reading, skiing, playing videogames, occasional hiking, and traveling. I'm studying Government and Chinese as my majors, and have spent two summers in China as part of the latter goal. I hope to work in the NGO field full time after I graduate, but teaching English in China for a few years also really appeals to me.
