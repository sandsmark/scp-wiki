Hello and welcome to my author page! I first discovered the Foundation in late 2016, and have been a huge fan ever since. Since you're here, feel free to check out my body of work. I hope you enjoy!

I'm also a Junior Staff member attached to the forum crit team (and the wikiwalk team too (and the rewrite team as well)). If you ever want a draft critiqued, just shoot me a message.

**Tales:**
None yet, but I have several plans:
* A series of tales about MTF Omega-12 from SCP-3480.
* A tale about the 3602 monkeys trying to rewrite their names into the register of death.
* Possible tales about Kektagon and GAW.
* Maybe writing for Resurrection at some point?

**Other Stuff:**
* Wrote log 012 for the [[[SCP-3301 Testing Log]]].

* Co-curator of the [http://www.scp-wiki.net/task-forces-complete-list Complete list of Mobile Task Forces] with Maliceaforethought.

**Author's Thoughts:**

[[collapsible show="+SCP-3480- Olympus Mons" hide="-Hide"]]
[[[SCP-3480 |SCP-3480 - Olympus Mons]]]
Oddly enough, this was originally inspired by a random pic of Olympus that was posted to r/europe. For some reason, it inspired me to take the leap and write a skip about Olympus, joining this fine community of writers. 

The exact process of plotting this one out was messy, but in the end I'm very happy with it. Also serves as a nice homage to SCP-2000, my personal favorite skip. I'm quite happy that my first skip did relatively well, and considering I did a major re-write a few weeks after the initial post I'm confident it could have done even better. I chose the number to reference the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 BC.

[[[SCP-3108|SCP-3108- The Nerfing Gun]]]
This is a light article I wrote based on a discussion Lefarsi and I were having in an SCP discord. It started off as a collab, but unfortunately Lefarsi had to stop due to irl business.

I had a hell of a time finishing this. I actually posted it once and self deleted, before doing a re-write. Connecting it to GAW happened pretty late in the process, but I think it wound up working well. 108 doesn't have any special significance for this skip, but it is my favorite number.

[[collapsible show="+SCP-3602- The Monkey King's Legacy" hide="-Hide"]]
[[[SCP-3602 |SCP-3602- The Monkey King's Legacy]]]
After I scrapped a long and disastrous draft about a Sealand-based skip, I decided to write something more simple. Inspired by my love of Chinese culture and Journey to the West, I decided to write about a loose end from the novel: the monkeys that Wukong made immortal before leaving them to become a Buddha with Xuanzang.

I'm happy with how it turned out. Ultimately, the ideas expressed were not anything revolutionary, but I think I executed a simple tale about immortality and abandonment quite well. The number 3602 was chosen to reference Xuanzang's birth year, and thus the individual who would deprive the monkeys of their king.

[[collapsible show="+SCP-3051- Revenge of the Human Rights Lobbyists" hide="-Hide"]]
[[[SCP-3051 |SCP-3051- Revenge of the Human Rights Lobbyists]]]
This skip was heavily inspired by the frustrations I've experienced working as a irl human rights lobbyists. Since Manna didn't have my restrictions, I can only assume they would show legislators the suffering they cause, as that is what I always wish I could do when I'm trapped in a meeting with the apathetic cretins.

Fun fact, the manna official was named after an irl boss of mine in the ngo. The number has so special significance save the fact that 3108 was originally posted to this slot, so since it was still open I decided to return it to my possession.

[[collapsible show="+SCP-3221- Prester John the Unbroken" hide="-Hide"]]
[[[SCP-3221 |SCP-3221- Prester John the Unbroken]]]
This skip was originally something my coauthor Tufto was working on, based on the irl legend of Prester John. I was interested in collaborating with him on it, and after he grew dissatisfied with the initial draft he passed it on to me. Originally, the story was much more about ORIA dealing with a parasitic dimension, and it had no sarkic and less broken god elements. Inspired by the cannibalism and the previous mekhanite usage, I retooled it into a demagogue using both faiths as a way to gain power. Hong Xiuquan's Taiping Rebellion and the theophagy theme of sarkicism both proved instrumental.

The number is chosen in reference to the year 1221, in which a letter claiming Prester John had acheived a great victory over the Muslims reached the west.

[[collapsible show="+SCP-3934- For Sale: Loch Ness Monsters" hide="-Hide"]]
[[[SCP-3934 |SCP-3934- For Sale: Loch Ness Monsters]]]
We didn't have a nessie skip and I wanted to be the one to write it. The whole thing is an allegory for the exotic pet industry. I was kinda hoping it would become really popular because of Nessie, but I suppose it's done alright.

The number is chosen in reference to the year 1934, when the famous Surgeon's photo was taken.

[[collapsible show="+SCP-3304- That Time the Foundation Froze Hell" hide="-Hide"]]
[[[SCP-3304 |SCP-3304- That Time the Foundation Froze Hell]]]
The original idea for this came from Hippo in a chat discussion, though I changed it around to be more of a comedic feghoot than the original concept. I also tied in the Ars Goetia demons via the character of Raum. This is my most divisive skip so far as many people feel it's too silly, but at the end of the day more people liked it than disliked it.

The number is chosen in reference to the area code of West Virginia, 304.

**About Me**
I'm a very activism focused guy finishing up college. I work for Amnesty International as a regional youth organizer and legislative coordinator (titled but unpaid). I've written amateur poetry for a long time but this is my first time really writing fiction.

My interests include reading, skiing, playing videogames, occasional hiking, and traveling. I'm studying Government and Chinese as my majors, and have spent two summers in China as part of the latter goal. I hope to work in the NGO field full time after I graduate, but teaching English in China for a few years also really appeals to me.
