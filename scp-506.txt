**Item #:** SCP-506

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-506 grows in a 3 m x 3 m patch of soil, kept watered and fertilized via an automatic system.  The air of the room where SCP-506 is kept must be filtered to prevent release of SCP-506 seeds into the environment.  Personnel entering the enclosure must wear biohazard suits composed of inorganic material, and must be decontaminated upon leaving the area.

**Description:** SCP-506 is a genetically engineered variant of zucchini (//Cucurbita pepo//) created by the ████████ Corporation as a hardy and rapid-growing food plant.  SCP-506 exhibits several undesirable and dangerous qualities:

(1)	SCP-506 will attempt to grow on any organic material, including on living beings.  The seeds germinate on contact.

(2)	SCP-506 grows extremely rapidly, reaching full size in five minutes or less.

(3)	Due to its rapid growth, SCP-506 drains its growing medium of nutrients at an accelerated rate.  Nothing will grow in soil that has harbored SCP-506 plants without extensive nutrient replacement.

(4)	SCP-506 seeds are much smaller than typical squash seeds, and disperse easily in the wind.

SCP-506 is inedible, as the seeds will [DATA EXPUNGED] if any are consumed.  To the best of the knowledge of The Foundation, SCP-506 has not escaped into the wild, and ████████ Corporation has destroyed all samples in their possession.
