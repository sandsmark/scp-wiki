**Item #:** SCP-4530

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4530 is to be patrolled and monitored by Stationary Task Force Sigma-2 ('Lynch Mob'), who are to maintain a 5 kilometer area of exclusion around SCP-4530. 

All persons found near or within the limits of this border are to be vacated from the premises. All evidence regarding disappearances linked to SCP-4530 is to be taken and documented.

Should an Aradia Event occur, personnel are to administer C-Class amnestics to the parents, families, and friends of children that have undergone the event. No personnel are to obstruct any children undergoing an Aradia Event. Foundation Webcrawler ('WICCAN') is to search and remove any online references, images, and articles pertaining to missing persons and disappearances of children in Olive Hill.

Under no circumstances are personnel allowed to enter SCP-4530. Should any persons or personnel enter SCP-4530, these persons are to be considered lost.

**Description:** SCP-4530 designates a wooded area of space located within the Tygarts State Forest of Olive Hill, Kentucky. The region exhibits varying degrees of numerous types of anomalies[[footnote]]Cabot, L., Gardner, G., & Ravenwolf, S. (1975). //The Signs of Abnormal Locations and the Unexplained// (1st ed., Vol. 1, Ser. 1). Foundation Research Press.[[/footnote]]. This list includes, but are not limited to:

* Heavy distortion of video quality, generation loss, and fluctuating electromagnetic interference.
* Sapient organisms experiencing paranoia and anxiety.
* The appearance of animal corpses belonging to that of the domestic pig[[footnote]]//Sus domesticus//[[/footnote]] and the Hebridean sheep[[footnote]]//Capra aegagrus hircus//[[/footnote]]. These animals appear across SCP-4530 in various states of decay. Most of these corpses have consisted of skulls decoratively strewn across the ground.
* Sounds described as shrieking, whispering, and laughter. In some cases, audio recording devices will not pick up on these sounds save for sapient individuals within SCP-4530.
* Disappearances of persons entering SCP-4530.
* The appearance and disappearance of SCP-4530-1 from within the borders of SCP-4530.

SCP-4530-1 is an entity that resides within SCP-4530. With individual eyewitness reports consisting of a young and attractive woman located within the forest[[footnote]]One consistent remark about these accounts claim that the entity wears a black dress or cloak[[/footnote]]. SCP-4530-1 provokes a fear response in sapient beings if seen.

An Aradia Event is an event wherein five children (ages between 3 to 14) are randomly selected across a localized region that prompts them to wake up at a certain time (in some cases, at approximately 3:00 AM), leave their homes and walk to the location of SCP-4530. Intervals between events can range anywhere from weeks to years[[footnote]](Leek, S., Boleyn, A., & Cunningham, S. (n.d.). //Documenting Extranormal Events// (3rd ed., Vol. 1). Foundation Research Press.)[[/footnote]].

**Addendum-4530.1:** First Contact

SCP-4530 was discovered in 1984, following the disappearance of a young woman named Megan Faye. According to the Kentucky State Police Department, Mrs. Faye had left her apartment on November 27, 1982 at 3:00 AM. Mrs. Faye had entered the region of SCP-4530 and never returned. Eyewitness accounts claimed that she walked barefoot all the way to the region. Police led a three-man investigation into the forest the following morning but never returned.

A sampling of the missing persons posters can be found below.

**Exploration log transcript**

**Date:** 12/14/1995

**Personnel used:** AI-controlled drone (GRIMASSI) is utilized to navigate and explore SCP-4530.

//The drone model used is a standard all-terrain traversal model equipped with a standard camera for exploratory purposes.//

-----

**<Begin Log>**

**00:01** The camera turns on as the drone moves further away from the exclusion zone, and onto the path, and deeper into SCP-4530.

**00:13** GRIMASSI continues down the path. Occasionally turning the camera on its head to view the terrain.

**00:39** GRIMASSI stops moving. It turns its head to the left side to see. There is nothing there.

**00:48** GRIMASSI continues forward. The camera finds the skull of a sheep on the ground in front and navigates around it. GRIMASSI captures the corpse of a pig to its right, impaled on a tree branch. The entrails are visible from the other end of the branch. The corpse appears to have died recently.

**01:03** GRIMASSI's camera experiences a slight decline in video quality. GRIMASSI picks up what sounds like barely audible whispering from its recorder. This is the first instance of SCP-4530's effect on electronics.
[[include component:image-block name=Deadtree.jpg| caption=**09:29**|width=310px]]
**1:54** The corpse of a pig is seen on a tree stump. The pig appears to have been dismembered across the torso from the head. The corpse appears to have been killed recently. GRIMASSI investigates the corpse for a few minutes before moving on.

**3:19** A large pit is discovered in the middle of the road. The camera pans closer to the hole and turns on its light. Inside the pit are hundreds of dolls made of wicker and black snakelike organisms moving around the hole. Each of the dolls are identical; having button eyes, yarn for hair, and ragged cloth for clothes. The dolls and snakes are too far out of reach for a closer look. The drone moves away, and continues around the hole.

**04:28** At this point, distorted whispering can be heard from the left of the drone. GRIMASSI ceases moving and turns its camera to the direction of the sound, only for the video and audio feed to cut off.

**09:29** The camera and audio feeds come back online. GRIMASSI's camera is looking up at a destroyed tree. Static can be heard from the audio, and the visual feed on the camera is black and white.

**09:45** The drone backs away from the tree. It gets darker through the feed, it becomes clear that the path is nowhere to be seen.

**09:50** GRIMASSI continues forward into the trees. The visual feed continues to decline significantly. The surrounding environment continues to get darker.

**10:03** GRIMASSI ceases movement for five seconds before the audio and visual feed cut out.

**Exploration log transcript**

**Date:** 12/18/1995

**Personnel used:** D-88328

//D-88328 is equipped with a standard flashlight, a body camera, two bottles of water, and three camera-mounted tripods used for monitoring anomalous activity while under cover.//

-----

**<Begin Log>**

**Command:** Comlink's up. Can you hear us? D-88328?

**D-88328:** Yeah, yeah, I hear you.

**Command:** Good. Proceed down the path.

//D-88328 walks down the pathway to SCP-4530. There is silence for the next ten seconds before his recorder picks up distorted laughter nearby and he stops.//

**D-88328:** Jesus fuck. Did you hear that? Scared the shit out of me.

**Command:** Yes.

**D-88328:** The fuck was that?

**Command:** None of your concern. Keep moving.

**D-88328:** Asshole.

//D-88328 continues down the path for five minutes. D-88328's camera captures an oddly shaped bundle of sticks and branches off the path to the left.//

**Command:** Alex, do you see that pile of wood to the left?

**D-88328:** Hey uh... yeah. Yeah, I think I see it. Don't tell me that I have to go there, please.

**Command:** Approach the object.

**D-88328:** //(Audible groaning.)// Fine.

[[include component:image-block name=Wood.jpg| caption=**Image taken from D-88328's camera.**|width=315px]]

//D-88328 walks away from the path and faces the direction of the object. He climbs over a log before slowly approaching the object. It appears to be a mass of sticks and branches folded and arranged together to form a small shack.//

**D-88328:** So... I'm uh.... here. It looks like uh... Eeyore's house or somethin'.

**Command:** Alex, do you think you can fit into the entrance?

**D-88328:** Doubt it. Not because I really don't want to go in there, but also because that little rabbit hole is too small for me go in.

**Command:** D-88328, use the tripods that were given to you.

//D-88328 puts down his backpack and unzips it.//

**D-88328:** Oh no.

**Command:** What? What is it?

**D-88328:** I- uh- //(Pauses.)// was there always one tripod here? Because I only have one left in my bag.

**Command:** That's impossible. We gave you three of them. How did you lose the rest?

**D-88328:** //(Breathing heavily.)// I- I don't know! I just- I swear, if I felt something touch it, I would've known-

**Command:** Forget it. Just make do with the one you have.

//D-88328 sets up the tripod and attaches its camera on the head. He props it up somewhere in front of the shack's entrance, hidden inside a bush.//

**D-88328:** All done.

**Command:** Excellent, now you can come back to the path. Do you remember where it was?

**D-88328:** Uh... yeah, I think so.

//D-88328 stands up and heads over to the log that he passed over a few minutes ago. D-88328 continues to walk through the wooded area for 20 seconds before pausing.//

**D-88328:** Uh... guys?

**Command:** What is it?

**D-88328:** I can't find the path anymore.

**Command:** Keep walking forward. You'll find it eventually.

**D-88328:** Alright, I'm fine. This is fine. I'll find it. I can find it.

//D-88328 continues walking into the forest, heading deeper and deeper within, until it starts to get darker.//

**Command:** D-88328? You can stop now.

//D-88328 continues to walk deeper within the forest. The surrounding area is starting to become devoid of light from the outside.//

**Command:** Alex?

//D-88328 starts walking slowly. Soft murmuring can be heard from him.//

**Command:** Alex!

//D-88328 ceases movement. The visual feed then cuts out completely, however, the audio feed does not. Wet crunching sounds and distorted singing and laughter can be heard through the radio over D-88328's murmuring. Command attempts to reestablish visual connection with D-88328. They are successful doing so but the audio feed is cut out completely.//

[[include component:image-block name=Lady.jpeg| caption=**Video still taken from D-88328's camera.**|width=210px]]

**Command:** Alex!? Can you hear me?

//The camera's visual feed is now colored a dark gray hue and suffering from generation loss. The feed is shaky, assumed to be D-88328 running away from something. D-88328 continues to run before slowing down and stopping completely.//

**Command:** Alex, respond!

//He leans forward against a tree, presumably to catch his breath. He looks around for a few seconds before he is violently pulled to the ground by an unseen force. When he comes to, a feminine figure[[footnote]]Assumed to be SCP-4530-1.[[/footnote]], is standing across him wearing a black cloak concealing the face.//

**Command:** Listen to me Alex! Alex!

//The figure raises its hand and makes a gesture with its fingers, urging D-88328 to come closer. White noise can be heard increasing in frequency as D-88328 slowly walks to the entity until they are close to each other and stops. The frequency distortion gets louder as the entity appears to take off its hood before the visual and audio feed are cut out again. Further attempts at reestablishing connection yielded no results.//

**Exploration log transcript**

**Date:** 12/18/1995

**Personnel used:** One standard camera with tripod attachment.

-----

**<Begin Log>**

**00:01** The camera turns on. D-88328 is seen fixing the tripod and looking at the camera. D-88328 leaves the vicinity and walks away from the camera's view of the shack's entrance.

**01:27** First sign of movement. A small snake crawls into the entrance of the shack, followed by three more snakes.

**01:33** The video resolution declines slightly. Noises emanating from the audio feed start to decline into static and highly distorted screaming.

**3:49** D-88328 appears into frame, walking, as if in a trance. He stops walking and begins to bend forward, coughing and gagging. The video quality starts to degrade.

**3:55** D-88328 puts his hand on a nearby tree and vomits, what appears to be, a Common Toad[[footnote]]//Bufo bufo//[[/footnote]]. D-88328 vomits about a dozen of these animals and can be heard crying. The snakes that entered the shack are seen leaving at this time as the feed declines in quality.

**4:01** A black goat walks in view of the camera and approaches D-88328. It opens its mouth and appears to 'talk' to him. Further review of the footage audio reveals no sound was made by the animal during that time.

**4:32** The visual feed begins to turn to a darkened blue hue. The goat moves to the front of the wooden construct and lies down. A pale human hand then appears out of the shack, grasping the ground in front of it as D-88328 starts sobbing even louder before the feed deteriorates to heavy static and cuts out.

> **Dracken:** We didn't.

> **Dracken:** Ye- Yes. His eyes were gone; couldn't tell if they were too sunken inside or they got removed but- but the poor sod was a pale blue color. He had roots entangling his throat and mouth and nearly everywhere over his corpse. Some 'shrooms were sticking out of his ears too. His body cam was gone however.

> **Dr. Piston:** And that was the point you encountered the entity?

> 
> **Dracken:** She did something to me. To all of us. We just stood there gawking like idiots; we couldn't even lift a finger. Next thing I knew I was- I was just frozen in- in- in fear. Like I could see this- Christ, I don't even know how to describe it. Looking at us.
> 
> **Dr. Piston:** Please continue.
> 
> **Dracken:** She pulled out her hand and she did these weird gestures and- and Mikey he- he got torn apart, it happened so fast. And then Jake started laughing. He was //fucking laughing.// I was- He just wouldn't stop. He just bent over and vomited these frogs from his mouth while he was still laughing!

> **Dr. Piston:** What else happened?
> 
> **Dracken:** Jake's skin. His skin started to //peel off.// It started from the top of his forehead and just went its way down. He- His suit and clothes also peeled off of him too. He was still laughing. He looked at me and wouldn't stop laughing. He just kept staring at me with his skinless, grinning face.

> **Dr. Piston:** What else did she do? Did she do anything to you?

> **Dracken:** She- I remember her choking me. She just lifted her hand and then I just couldn't breathe.

**Note:** On 13/9/1997, Field Agent Carly Dracken went missing. Agent Dracken's disappearance was reported as an internal securities breach and a site-wide investigation was put in place for her. However, there was no evidence of her disappearance, with the only evidence being mounds of soil and a doll made of wicker on top of her bed, located within her quarters.

Investigation into the incident is still ongoing.
