This will be a lot prettier soon! Am out of the house and running behind. 

The contest theme is history (whether world history, the Foundation or GOI's history, or even site history, if you can swing it), in honor of our site's tenth anniversary! The first date of posting will be JULY 1ST, 2018. Date of closing will be announced at a later date as we run out of slots in Series IV. 

Rules, some truly lovely art by Zhange, and a short statement will be up within the hour. Sorry for the dust!
