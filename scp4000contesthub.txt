[[size 300%]]**SCP-4000 Contest: History!**[[/size]]

++ Our wiki's been around 10 long years. But the Foundation, the GOIs, anomalies, and the world have been around a hell of a lot longer than that. How did things look 20 years ago? 200? 2,000? 20,000? We look forward to you guys telling us.

+ Dates

**Posting Opens:** July 1st, 2018 12:00 AM Eastern Time
**Posting Closes:** August 1st, 2018, 12:00 AM Eastern Time
**Results Decided:** August 8th, 2018 12:00 AM Eastern Time

+ To Enter:

Post your entry to the site with the url '4000contest<yourusername>' with your site user name in place of <yourusername.> For example, if a user named TroyL were to post an entry it would have the url 4000contesttroyl. This page must be posted by you (or, if it is a collaboration, one of the partners). Add the tag "4000" to your entry so it shows up on this page.

+ Rules

* Be good to each other, seriously.
* Any contestant who takes unusual and/or negative actions to increase their vote total, or decrease that of their competitors, will be disqualified for the involved contest and potentially banned from further contests (and possibly further disciplinary action).
 * Examples of shenanigans include, but are in no way limited to:
  * Downvoting all of your competitors' work within minutes of them being posted
  * Spamming people with PMs about your work
  * Spurring Malicious Upvoting/Downvoting, whether on your work or anyone else's
 * If you're not sure if something counts as shenanigans, then it probably does, but feel free to ask a Community Outreach Member.
* One entry per user
* Collaborations are allowed, but that will count as the one entry for all participants
* Pre-existing drafts are allowed, so long as they have never been posted to the wiki
* History will be interpreted very broadly. Dinosaurs are just as historical as the Civil War is, for our purposes. Hell, if you can swing Site History, even that'll count. So long as you can explain how your work relates to history as a concept, in any interpretation, it'll be accepted. The theme is here to inspire, not constrain. If you're not sure if it'll count, feel free to ask.
* Edits to works **are** allowed.
* Contest entries will undergo normal deletion processes.
* The prize, obviously, is the SCP-4000 slot. Runners up get to choose other Series V slots in order of place.
