title:Scp 038
**Item #:** SCP-038

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedure:** SCP-038 is to be watered twice per day via overhead mister. Should mister, for any reason, break, attendants should water SCP-038 by hand until it has been fixed. Attendants watering SCP-038 by hand and maintenance personnel fixing mister should wear hazmat suits to prevent accidental cloning. Lighting is provided from SCP-037 in the room above it.

**Description:** Artifact was found on an abandoned farm in █████████████, New York in 19██. It was at first thought to be a common apple tree. However, upon closer inspection, it became apparent that the artifact was growing things other than apples and, in fact, other than fruit.

SCP-038 has the unique ability to clone any object that touches its bark. Objects begin growing almost instantaneously and reach maturity within a matter of minutes. A weight limit of 200 pounds per object has been previously recorded. Objects that SCP-038 has thus far cloned include: apples, oranges, watermelons, eggplants, candy bars and snack foods (See Addendum #1), televisions, toasters, laptops, keys (See Addendum #2), chairs, wine, DVDs/CDs (See Addendum #3), cats, dogs, and people.

Human and animal cloning through SCP-038 is not recommended, as they appear to age quickly. The majority of these clones live, on average, two weeks. After thorough examinations of the deceased clones, it has been determined that they had begun to ferment before death.

Object is currently held on Site 23 and there are currently no plans to move it.

**Document #338-1:** "I would like to remind all personnel that SCP-038 is not, I repeat, **not** a toy. It should not be used for cloning car keys, movies, music or items from the vending machines. If this behavior continues I will be forced to limit access to SCP-038.
- Dr. Klein"

**Document #338-2:** It has been noted that SCP-038 is able to clone [[[SCP-500]]] -- however, such pills only work 30% of the time, with chance of successfully healing dropping as time since cloned increases. In 60% of the cases where the infection is permanent symptoms of infection remain, though further infestation is neutralized.
