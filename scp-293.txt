**Item #:** SCP-293

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:**

Any items affected by SCP-293 are to be contained in an opaque container, and kept sealed when not undergoing testing.  Any items found to be affecting staff or subjects not undergoing testing are to be immediately destroyed.  Any anomalous activity by SCP-293 effected items is to be reported to Site Command as soon as possible.

Anyone interacting with items affected by SCP-293 must do so only in 30 minute shifts, with one week of time separating each interaction.  This includes physical handling, observation (both physical and via camera or other recording device), testing, and any other activities that bring a SCP-293 effected item into contact with human beings.

All staff working with SCP-293 affected items must submit to a psychological evaluation three times per week, to begin two weeks before interaction, and extending for three weeks after the end of interaction.  Staff must also submit to any additional test as ordered by Site Command.  Anyone found to be effected by SCP-293 will be placed in quarantine, and the item causing the effect is to be immediately destroyed.

Any items used to interact with SCP-293 effected items are to be disposed of after one week.


**Description:**

SCP-293 is totally undetectable at this time.  It is currently unknown if it is some form of dimensional anomaly, sub-microscopic virus, or a self-contained mental trigger.  SCP-293 is only visible in its effect on human behavior, and is undetectable on any scanning equipment.  This forms the greatest danger of SCP-293, as it is impossible to detect if items or people are “infected” by SCP-293 without long-term observation.

SCP-293 “latches on” to physical items.  These are often small “nick-knacks”, but some items are quite large, such as cars, and in once case a two-story residential home.  SCP-293 will spread to new items if they are left in close (within 2 yards) proximity for several weeks.  It does not appear to “latch on to” living things and its effect is only visible in humans.  It is unknown how SCP-293 spreads to new items, or what the criteria is for an item to be “infected”.

[[/div]]
SCP-293 causes those affected by it to become wholly obsessed with the item it is “latched on” to.  This effect manifests slowly, but will increase exponentially until the destruction of the item, or the mental breakdown/death of the subject.  This appears to be accelerated by observation and physical contact with items affected by SCP-293.  Subject will rapidly become withdrawn and antisocial, and react violently to anyone attempting to touch or remove the item.  Subject will construct rituals, such as frequent touching, movement, or re-positioning of the object, which escalate in frequency, duration, and complexity as time goes on.  Attempts to interrupt these rituals will cause the subject to enter an extreme state of fear, depression, or anger.

In many cases, the obsession and ritual cycle of SCP-293 will grow to the point where the subject is unable to function in society, needing constant contact with the SCP-293 effected item, and unable to perform simple tasks, such as preparing food, engaging in personal hygiene, or sleeping.  This often results in the death of the subject due to personal neglect.
Attempting to remove the item from the subject will cause the subject to enter a violent, fearful, depressed, hysterical, or one of many other mental states.  These “episodes” are often impossible to end, except by the return of the item, or several months of separation.  Subjects will become more and more erratic and hysterical the longer they are separated, and will violently attack others to re-acquire the item.  Subjects will often commit suicide after several days of separation from, or loss of, the SCP-293 affected item.

The Foundation currently has 182 items affected by SCP-293 in storage.  It is unknown at this time how many items worldwide may be affected by SCP-293, and questions have been raised as to SCP-293 and its possible relationship to several other SCP items and the exploits of some serial murderers.
