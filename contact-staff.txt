+++ I need help with my application to join the site!
//Please see the next section (on general questions and the Community Outreach Team) for whom to contact.//
* Site administrators process all mainsite applications, and generally review them a few times a day. Please be patient, and only contact staff //if you have been waiting longer than 72 hours// for your application to be reviewed.
* While only admins can approve/deny apps, other staff can look over application text to determine if it meets criteria. If there are no admins around, you can ask another staff member if your application fulfills requirements.
* Note that admins tend to be the busiest staff on the site, so replies from them may take some time. For fastest response, go to the [http://www.scp-wiki.net/chat-guide chat] and ask for an admin.
* **Refer to the [http://www.scp-wiki.net/system:join Join This Site] page for all necessary application information.**
