+++ I need help with my application to join the site!

//Please see the next section (on general questions and the Community Outreach Team) for whom to contact.//
* Site administrators process all mainsite applications, and generally review them a few times a day. Please be patient, and only contact staff //if you have been waiting longer than 72 hours// for your application to be reviewed.
* While only admins can approve/deny apps, other staff can look over application text to determine if it meets criteria. If there are no admins around, you can ask another staff member if your application fulfills requirements.
* Note that admins tend to be the busiest staff on the site, so replies from them may take some time. For fastest response, go to the [http://www.scp-wiki.net/chat-guide chat] and ask for an admin.

* **Refer to the [http://www.scp-wiki.net/system:join Join This Site] page for all necessary application information.**

+++ I need feedback on my mainsite page, have a question about giving site feedback, or someone is giving me critique that is against site rules.
//The Site Criticism Team responds to new pages on the mainsite and monitors the posts made when a new article or tale is submitted.//
* Note that once a piece has been submitted to the mainsite, it is considered finished work and no one is obligated to give any more feedback than their vote--those who do give detailed feedback are doing the author a courtesy, not fulfilling a requirement.
* The mainsite is //not// the place for works in progress. Drafts are reviewed in forums or chat (see below entry regarding Forum Criticism).
* If you want a page of yours reviewed by a staff member, contact a member of the [http://05command.wikidot.com/site-crit-main Site Criticism Team] (note that individual staff response may be slower, depending on what times staff members are available):

* For the fastest response, use the [http://www.scp-wiki.net/chat-guide IRC chatroom], or make a new thread in the [http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/c-50864 Drafts Critique subforum].
* If no one has replied to your thread after a day or two, you may PM a staff member to ask site members currently in the chatroom to read your draft. Do not bump your thread unless announcing significant changes, as this causes spam buildup. Forum threads with fewer replies are prioritized.
* If you want a draft reviewed by a staff member, contact a member of the [http://05command.wikidot.com/forum-crit-main Forum Criticism Team] (note that individual staff response may be slower, depending on what times staff members are available. You are encouraged to use the forums and chat!):
