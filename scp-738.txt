    **Item #:** SCP-738

    **Object Class:** Keter

    **Special Containment Procedures:**
SCP-738 is to be kept in three linked sealed chambers with armed guards and a remote detonation procedure at all times, as well as constant full audio/visual surveillance. 

When SCP-738 is not in use, it’s components must be kept one to each chamber. Mechanical means built into the containment area are to be used to assemble and disassemble SCP-738. 

Should mechanical assembly means fail, then testing is to be canceled until an engineer fitted with an explosive collar can be sent in to repair the systems. Said engineer is to be detonated upon any attempt to interact with any component of SCP-738.  

Should mechanical disassembly fail, preset shaped charges shall be used to disassemble SCP-738 then the system should be repaired and reset by a single engineer fitted with an explosive collar.

All class D personnel used to test the device must be mildly mentally retarded or less functional, and must be fitted with an explosive collar. This is in order to prevent them from learning too much about SCP-738 and possibly using the SCP-738 in a way that is detrimental to the foundation.


Class D personnel with IQs over 60, and all other personnel are not allowed into the room containing SCP-738. Class D personnel are allowed into the room containing SCP-738 for experimentation only and are to be provided with continual instruction by research personnel.

    **Description:**
SCP-738-1 is an office desk with a height of 78 cm. The desk is 142 cm wide and 86 cm deep. The desk is made entirely of mahogany and possesses a flat top that has a rectangular shape. One the left and right are a series of mahogany drawers under the surface. The drawers commence 2 cm from the floor, and end under the 3 cm thick surface of the desk. In this space there are 5 regularly sized drawers on each side. The legs are 7 cm thick and located along the outside of the desk. The width of each of the drawer sections is 23 cm. The backstop of the desk is 6 cm thick. The volume of each of the 10 identical drawers (One bank of 7 on each side) is 14x23x81 cm^^3^^ (26827 cm ^^3^^) or 26.8 liters. 

The face of each drawer posses a simple square brass handle. The handles are 6.3 mm in cross section, they project 3.8 cm from the surface of the wood, and they are 6.35 cm wide. Each drawer’s face posses a brass lock located 1 cm from the top. The lock has a diameter of 5 mm and a depth of 1.5 cm. This is only .5 cm less then the thickness of the face of the drawer. The lock is a pin tumbler lock. Attempts to pick the locks have been successful, and show that the drawers are empty. There is also a long drawer under the center area, with the bottom 4 cm from the top. This drawer is unlocked, and also empty.

SCP-738-2 is a mahogany chair. The back is 94 cm high and the seat is 52 cm off the ground. It has cross supports between the legs, and a small dark purple pad in the seat of the chair made of velvet and stuffed with cotton.

SCP-738-3 is an ornate mahogany chair. The back is 2.5 meters high, and the seat is 60 cm off the ground. The chair possesses armrests, as well as much thicker legs then SCP-738-2. The seat is also wider, and the seat, insides of the armrests, and back are all upholstered with rich purple uncrushed velvet. The crown of the chair is an intricately carved scene of rose vines and flowers, with a pentagram in a circle in the center. This is the only elaborate ornamentation on the entire set of SCP-738-1, -2, and -3.

The effect begins when a sentient entity sits in SCP-738-2 in ‘front’ of SCP-738-1 with SCP-738-3 resting behind SCP-738-2. Cameras show SCP-738-3 moving during the effect, frequently leaning back into a ‘relaxed state’ as well as moving closer to, or further away from SCP-738-2. Occasionally SCP-738-3 is moved in front of SCP-738-2. Furthermore cameras show papers and folders containing papers leaving SCP-738-3’s drawers. The papers are made of parchment. A quill pen and a bottle of ink emerge from the long drawer.  The pen will write on the parchment. 

Audio recorders will record a distorted voice speaking. This voice will make offers, and promises and attempt to tempt SCP-738-2. Meaning has been extracted from the spoken voice. If, in this time, the entity sitting in SCP-738-2 makes a request, then the tempting and offers will cease. There will be a pause and a price will be stated. This can be bargained with, however the voice will insist on other prices of ‘equal value’ Occasionally when a request is made the voice will respond by telling the requester that they ‘do not want the object enough’ or that they are ‘obviously requesting the object for someone else to get around paying full price’ in which case the request is not fulfilled. This occurs most frequently for requests that can effect other people, or can transfer possession.

Accepting the deal causes the agreed upon wish or command to be fulfilled to the letter but not past the letter. Furthermore it will cause the occurrences stated in the price to be paid. The entity has actively stated that the occurrences in the price are intended to cause an amount of emotional and/or physical pain equal to the amount that the requester desires what they request. How parity is calculated is at present unknown. The price has also been stated to be independent of any pain caused by fulfilling the request. See the test log for examples of prices paid, and requests made. 

As a final note, personnel in the chair have stated seeing an entity sitting in SCP-738-3. However all attempts to observe this entity when not seated in SCP-738-2 have failed, and further descriptions of the entity are inconsistent between sessions, even with multiple sessions with the same person. However, if asked about this the entity claims to be the same entity each time. Some frequent descriptions of the entity include ‘seductive’ and ‘charming’. Sessions with the same person that are close in time report the similar or identical entity appearances. Sessions with different people that are close in time report different entities appearances. Descriptions of the voice do not match the voice recorded on the equipment.
