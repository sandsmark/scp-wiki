+ LOOK UPON MY VAST NUMBER OF TALES, YE MIGHTY, AND DESPAIR!
~LutherC from #site19

Hi, my name is Ricky, I'm 21 now, and I never fuckin' learned how to read. 

I am currently writing a tale for every SCP on site. My progress will be documented here, on my author page.

Wow remember when I made that goal? I sure do. And what a ride it's been since then! Anyway, this series is getting a massive overhaul so. Prepare for things to change!
