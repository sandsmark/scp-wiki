**Item #:** SCP-3009

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3009 may be logged in on one (1) instance of SCP-3009-B, which is to be kept in storage at Site-19. SCP-3009 is not permitted to publish Snapchats to any public forum, nor may it exchange correspondences with civilians or unapproved site personnel. Approved personnel may exchange correspondences with SCP-3009 on Snapchat for the purpose of fulfilling its socialisation needs, contingent on its good behaviour. All correspondences with SCP-3009 must be screenshotted for the Foundation’s records. 

SCP-3009 appears to believe that the Foundation will assist it in returning to its own body and has so far fully co-operated with the Foundation based on this stipulation. It is highly recommended that personnel assigned correspondence duty with SCP-3009 maintain this belief if possible.

SCP-3009-C is currently housed in Site-17 and is not permitted unsupervised contact with electronics. In the event of a containment breach, SCP-3009-C has been implanted with a tracking device. It is to be provided with non-electronic forms of entertainment such as books, board games or magazines targeted at a teenaged audience when requested, and is permitted supervised socialisation with approved Foundation staff members depending on their availability.

//UPDATE: In light of Experiment 3009-A-4, SCP-3009 may be reprimanded in the event of a disciplinary infraction by being logged out of all instances of SCP-3009-B for a time period dependent on the severity of the infraction but lasting no more than three weeks.//

//In light of Experiment 3009-B-5, it is strongly recommended as of ██/06/2018 that Foundation staff refrain from initiating discussion of communications with SCP-3009 while SCP-3009-C is present, except in the settings of either counselling sessions or during testing.//

**Description:** SCP-3009 is an anomalous account registered under the username [REDACTED] on the messaging platform Snapchat.[[footnote]]A multimedia messenger app that can be installed on smartphones, upon which users communicate via self-erasing captioned photographs and videos.[[/footnote]] Despite its lack of a current active user, it continues to send and reply to messages sent by the accounts registered on its contact list. 

SCP-3009 regularly generates multimedia messages appearing to depict a female human of East Asian descent in her mid-teens. The vast majority of these messages appear to be photographs taken by the aforementioned human of herself, most often using the front-facing camera,[[footnote]]Colloquially known as "selfies".[[/footnote]] accompanied by captions of a usually humorous nature.

SCP-3009-B is the designation given to all instances of smartphones upon which the anomalous SCP-3009 account is registered, most notably including SCP-3009-B-1, the original instance of SCP-3009-B. The background of all SCP-3009 generated multimedia corresponds with the immediate location of the relevant SCP-3009-B instance. In the event of two or more SCP-3009-B instances existing, SCP-3009 will favour the instance which was created first.

The humanoid depicted in SCP-3009 created media has been identified as the original user of the account, a female American citizen known to associates as Stacey Lee (D.O.B: ██/██/2003, aged 15 upon recovery of the anomaly). Lee created the account in 2014 and used it until early 2018 without reported signs of anomalous activity. 

SCP-3009 either is, is impersonating, or believes itself to be Lee. Messages exchanged with SCP-3009 have revealed behaviour that is consistent with Lee’s personality prior to any anomalous incidents, based on the psychological profile put together via analysis of Lee’s other social media accounts and interviews with Lee’s associates. SCP-3009 demonstrates in-depth knowledge regarding Lee’s history and preferences, and furthermore appears to incorporate the same tonality and typing quirks commonly used by Lee on social media. On multiple occasions, SCP-3009 has expressed a desire to return to Lee’s body.

SCP-3009-C is a female human of Eastern Asian descent that either is, is impersonating, or believes itself to be the female human Stacey Lee. SCP-3009-C measures 1.61 m in height and weighs approximately 52 kilograms as of the writing of this article. All biological data collected from SCP-3009-C corresponds with normal values for a human female of SCP-3009-C’s height and weight. DNA taken from SCP-3009-C matches that of Stacey Lee.

Both SCP-3009 and SCP-3009-C claim to be the original Stacey Lee, and when questioned further, suggested that their counterparts were likely "impostor[s]". At this time, the Foundation is not able to determine whether one, both, or neither of subjects is the real Stacey Lee. Testing is currently in progress, with only inconclusive results so far regarding the anomalous nature of SCP-3009-C and the source of the anomaly.

**MTF:** MTF Gamma-5 ("Red Herrings")

**Date:** █/02/2018

**Location:** New York City, New York

**Debrief:** At 09:41 on █/05/2018, SCP-3009 posted a series of six (6) images to the public New York City Snapchat Story which seemingly depicted a duplication of the same person. These images were accompanied by assertions that it was trapped within its account on the app, as well as a plea to the general public for assistance in getting out. It then repeated these claims every hour for the next three days. 

The disturbing imagery along with the length, detail and unbelievable nature of SCP-3009's statements led to viral dissemination on social media and subsequent coverage by internet journalism websites, notably including BuzzFeed and Huffington Post. Application of amnestics in the wake of this incident was made unnecessary thanks to the speedy intervention of MTF Gamma-5 ("Red Herrings"), who passed the incident off as an internet hoax and took SCP-3009 into Foundation custody along with the original instance of SCP-3009-B and SCP-3009-C.

Though initially approached as a related civilian witness to the anomaly, SCP-3009-C was taken into custody for further evaluation regarding the allegations made by SCP-3009. At time of recovery, SCP-3009-C was a tenth grader at N████ High School.

Interview 3009-1: 
> //Notes: The following is an excerpt from the initial interview between SCP-3009 and Researcher Kim. All recorded communications took place over Snapchat’s text messaging service unless otherwise specified.//
> 
> **Researcher Kim:** Hello, SCP-3009. I’m Junior Researcher Benedict Kim. Can you please tell us your name for our records? 
> 
> //SCP-3009 sends an unfiltered image depicting Stacey Lee. The caption reads: "apparently it’s little debatable right now, but I’m 100% sure that my name is Stacey Lee lolll".//
> 
> **SCP-3009:** (also switching to Snapchat’s text message) and before you ask, I really have no clue how I got in here hahaha!!!
> 
> **Researcher Kim:** Oh?
> 
> **SCP-3009:** yeah i just kinda woke up in here?
> **SCP-3009:** sorry about all that stuff with the NYC story btw!!
> **SCP-3009:** i was really scared
> **SCP-3009:** i mean, i was mysteriously sucked into my snapchat account!! You’d be scared too, right?
> 
> **Researcher Kim:** That’s fine. Can you answer some questions for me?
> 
> **SCP-3009:** okie dokie!!
> 
> //Researcher Kim proceeds to ask a variety of questions regarding the habits and preferences of Stacey Lee in order to assess similarities between the original, SCP-3009 and SCP-3009-C. SCP-3009 struggles to recall the third and fourth digits of the original Stacey Lee’s passport number. At one point, SCP-3009 interrupts and the following exchange takes place://
> 
> **SCP-3009:** more importantly!! about the person who stole my body
> **SCP-3009:** do you think you can get it back for me???
> 
> **Researcher Kim:** That is unfortunately unclear at this point. Would you like to elaborate about your feelings on SCP-3009-C and the source of the anomaly?
> 
> **SCP-3009:** well, it's like, literal identity theft!! invasion of the body snatchers much?? 
> **SCP-3009:** i think I would have wayyy preferred it if it had just taken my credit card details or something.
> **SCP-3009:** it’s gotta be an imposter, probably, right? pretending to be me for some reason?
> **SCP-3009:** it wouldn’t be hard to learn my personality, especially if it’s been watching me for a while.
> 
> //The interview continues for a further twenty minutes, with Researcher Kim redirecting the conversation towards SCP-3009’s experience within the app. SCP-3009 claims to have an altered sense of time "within the app", perceiving the three days which had passed between its initial containment and the present interview as only a single day. Other than this, no other pertinent information is obtained.//

Interview 3009-C-1: 
> //Notes: The following is an excerpt from the initial interview between SCP-3009-C and Researcher Kim.//
>  
> **Researcher Kim:** Hello, 3009-C. I’m Junior Researcher Benedict Kim. Can you please say your name for our records? 
>  
> **SCP-3009-C:** Okay… um, obviously you guys are telling me that this is a little debatable right now, but I’m 100% sure that my name is Stacey Lee. And before you ask, I really don’t have anything else to tell you. I have no clue what’s going on with my Snapchat account.
>  
> **Researcher Kim:** Oh?
> 
> **SCP-3009-C:** Everyone kept asking me, you know, like… why I kept posting all that stuff. I thought I’d been hacked. I mean, kind of hard to predict that my account had mysteriously gained sentience or something, right?
> 
> **Researcher Kim:** Okay. I see. Can you answer some questions for me?
> 
> **SCP-3009-C:** Sure.
> 
> //Researcher Kim proceeds to ask a variety of questions regarding the habits and preferences of Stacey Lee in order to assess similarities between the original, SCP-3009 and SCP-3009-C. SCP-3009-C’s answers are for the most part identical to those of SCP-3009, differing only regarding favourite colour (SCP-3009 had said light pink, SCP-3009-C specifies "pastel purple"). Notably, like SCP-3009, SCP-3009-C also struggles to recall the third and fourth digits of the original Stacey Lee’s passport number.//
> 
> **Researcher Kim:** All right, that’s enough. That’s all for toda—
> 
> **SCP-3009-C:** (interrupting) Wait. Um, about my Snapchat account — 
> 
> **Researcher Kim:** Yes?
> 
> **SCP-3009-C:** You know it’s not me, right? I mean, I’m standing right here. Just because it says it’s me doesn’t mean that it //is// me. 
> 
> **Researcher Kim:** At this time we don’t have enough evidence to make a decision one way or another, unfortunately. Still, we’ll take your testimony into account.
> 
> **SCP-3009-C:** (becoming visibly distressed) Are you serious? It’s literally a talking Snapchat account!
> 
> **Researcher Kim:** Indeed. It’s unfortunate, but—
> 
> **SCP-3009-C:** It’s, like, like — literal identity theft, or something. Look, I don’t know what it is, but it’s definitely not me. There’s nothing freaky about me. I’m totally normal.
> 
> **Researcher Kim:** Do you want to elaborate about your feelings on SCP-3009 and the source of the anomaly, then?
> 
> **SCP-3009-C:** Um, well… it’s got to be an imposter, right? Pretending to be me for some reason? It wouldn’t be hard to learn my personality, especially if it’s been in my account for a while.

[[collapsible show="[+] Addendum 3009.2: Experiment Series A" hide="[–] Addendum 3009.2: Experiment Series A"]]
**Experiment Series A:** This experimental series focused on the limits of SCP-3009’s abilities. Experiments were carried out between ██/02/2018 and ██/06/2018 under the supervision of Dr. Dennis Coles with the assistance of Junior Researchers Benedict Kim and Peter Tan.
||~ Designation ||||~ Procedure||||~ Results ||
|| 3009-A-1 |||| SCP-3009 was logged into two (2) instances of SCP-3009-B at once. These were SCP-3009-B-1, an Apple iPhone X located in Site-19 Laboratory D, and SCP-3009-B-2, a Huawei Mate 10 Pro which Dr. Coles brought to an on-site Burger King. SCP-3009 was instructed to attempt to send an image to the Snapchat account of Researcher Kim. |||| SCP-3009 initially sent a selfie captioned "wew science is cool" from SCP-3009-B-1, appearing to favour its initial SCP-3009-B instance. Upon further prompting, it was able to send a further image from SCP-3009-B-2 with Researcher Kim in the background, captioned: "u ordered a salad at burger king, that’s so sad doc" ||
|| 3009-A-2 |||| The SCP-3009-B instance was held by Researcher Kim. SCP-3009 was instructed to have Researcher Kim participate in the selfie. |||| SCP-3009 sent an image in which it and Researcher Kim appeared to be posing together for a photograph, captioned: "i'm cuter, right?" ||
|| 3009-A-3 |||| The SCP-3009-B instance was left next to food items (braised chicken feet) ordered by Researcher Kim from the Chinese restaurant █████ ██████. SCP-3009 was instructed to send an image of an attempt to consume it. |||| SCP-3009 was apparently able to "consume" food items for the purposes of the requested photograph without apparent difficulty aside from multiple complaints about the food selection. Once the image was taken, SCP-3009 reported no longer being able to access or taste the food items.||
|| 3009-A-4 |||| SCP-3009 was logged out of all instances of SCP-3009-B for a period of six hours and instructed to send an image to the Snapchat account of Researcher Kim during this time. |||| SCP-3009 was unable to send any images but reported still being conscious. Being logged out of all instances of SCP-3009-B appears to be the equivalent of being put into solitary isolation for SCP-3009, with possible applications as a disciplinary measure. ||
|| 3009-A-5 |||| Crosstest with [[[SCP-2232|SCP-2232]]]. SCP-3009 was logged in on [[[SCP-2232|SCP-2232]]] and instructed to send an image to Researcher Kim. |||| [[[SCP-2232|SCP-2232]]] transformed into a homing pigeon and flew to Researcher Kim's location, and then attempted to paint a portrait of SCP-3009 in a combination of its own blood and vomit. This took approximately two hours and thirteen minutes. Upon completion of the portrait, [[[SCP-2232|SCP-2232]]] vocalized the caption (in this case, "i feel a sudden urge to eat sunflower seeds") and flew back to its original location.||

//NOTES: To be considered for further testing -- will SCP-3009 age at the same rate that SCP-3009-C does? Will SCP-3009 continue to exist if its original body dies? These questions obviously cannot both be answered now, since finding an immediate answer to the second would preclude an eventual answer to the first. Nevertheless, it is indeed a rather a fascinating inquiry. - Dr. Dennis Coles//

**Experiment Series B:** This experimental series focused on the similarities between SCP-3009 and SCP-3009-C. Experiments were carried out between ██/05/2018 and ██/06/2018 under the supervision of Dr. Dennis Coles with the assistance of Junior Researchers Benedict Kim and Peter Tan.
||~ Designation ||||~ Procedure||||~ Results ||
|| 3009-B-1 |||| SCP-3009 and SCP-3009-C were asked to recall several details about the life of Stacey Lee prior to the anomaly, including but not limited to names and birthdays of relatives, governmental and school identification numbers, and former addresses. |||| SCP-3009 performed somewhat better than SCP-3009-C, with a 94.3% success rate. SCP-3009-C’s performance was slightly worse with a 84.2% success rate. ||
|| 3009-B-2 |||| SCP-3009 and SCP-3009-C were tested on their preferences in comparison to the preferences of Stacey Lee as reported by relatives and friends. |||| SCP-3009 and SCP-3009-C gave identical answers each time, matching each other at a 100% rate. Their answers were a 72% match with the estimation compiled from the suggestions of their associates. ||
|| 3009-B-3 |||| SCP-3009 and SCP-3009-C were tested on their academic abilities and asked to complete an examination in the subjects that they most recently covered in school. |||| SCP-3009 performed slightly better than SCP-3009-C, scoring 2% higher. ||
|| 3009-B-4 |||| SCP-3009 and SCP-3009-C were asked to complete a questionnaire regarding what they would do in particular situations, such as finding a lost wallet on the street or discovering that a significant other had been unfaithful. |||| SCP-3009 and SCP-3009-C exhibited the largest difference in results here, with only a 60% match with each other. It should be noted that SCP-3009’s answers were more consistent with Stacey Lee’s personality profile. ||
|| 3009-B-5 |||| SCP-3009 and SCP-3009-C were exposed to each other for the period of a thirty minute long interview under the supervision of Researcher Kim. |||| SCP-3009 and SCP-3009-C initially showed signs of hostility towards each other that was exacerbated when SCP-3009 asserted that SCP-3009-C’s personality did not match that of Stacey Lee. SCP-3009-C showed signs of distress throughout much of the interview. The subjects eventually de-escalated the conflict without interference. See transcript of Experiment 3009-B-5 below. ||

//NOTE: How does one test for whether a subject is a specific individual or not, when biological data is no longer an option? We’ve tested the subjects’ memories, their preferences and mental capabilities, but... is that enough? It’s hard to say. We're doing all that we can, but ultimately we’re scientists, not philosophers. - Dr. Dennis Coles//

//NOTE: Further experiments exposing SCP-3009 and SCP-3009-C are pending approval due to the marked decline in SCP-3009-C's mental health post-Experiment 3009-B-5. Further details are given in the psychological evaluation compiled by Researcher Kim and Dr. Geraldine Young.//

//NOTE: The following is an excerpt from the private journal of SCP-3009-C, written a few days after Experiment 3009-6.//

██/06/2018
> I met her a few days ago. I’ve been begging Researcher Kim to let me go home this entire time, but suddenly I’m glad that they won’t let either of us "communicate with civilians" until they work out which one of us is the real one. Mum, Dad, W██… would they prefer her, if they met her? Would they think she was the real one? //Is// she the real one? I think I’d prefer her, if I was them. 
> 
> It’s like nothing fazes her. She’s in that stupid app just… I don’t know, making snide jokes and giving all the researchers that goddamn smug smile, so confident in who she is. She doesn’t hate me because she doesn’t //need// to hate me, because she’s so sure that she’s real and I’m not. It should have been so easy to accuse her of being an imposter, but I just couldn’t. Talking to her… she doesn’t even have a body and honestly she feels more real than I do. I hate her. I want to be her. She’s everything that I used to like about myself.
> 
> I’ve been so off-balance since all of this started. No, since before that, maybe. It’s hard to put a finger on when I started feeling wrong like this. I thought it would pass but it didn’t. Now I can’t tell if I’m just depressed or if I’m literally a different person. Maybe I really am someone else and I just haven’t figured it out yet.
> 
> The researchers here keep giving me stuff to do. There’s always experiments to participate in, books to read, psychologists to talk to… but it's all pointless. It takes so much effort to drag myself through the day — it feels like I’m walking through treacle or something. Privacy doesn't exist here. They’ll probably read this journal as soon as I’m out of the room. Are they going to add this to their file of all the evidence against me being the real one? I don’t know, and I don’t know if I care. I’m tired all the time and I can’t even remember how long it’s been since I got here. Do I still want to go home? Does it even matter that they’re keeping me here?
> 
> Having a conversation with her… I don’t even know how to describe it. I thought the problem was that we’re the same, but it’s not. The //real// problem is that there’s this new and improved version of me preserved forever in digital form, and she looks like me and talks like me, but she’s better at being me than I am. Was I really that happy once? Was I really that confident? This is going to sound really stupid, but she reminds me of those fossils that they’ve got in museums of insects from a million years ago. It’s like looking at a butterfly crystallised in amber, except that the butterfly is "Stacey back when things were okay" and the amber is some stupid app.
> 
> God. Maybe she’s the real Stacey Lee after all. Maybe I'm just her distorted reflection in a funhouse mirror, staring out at the real thing from limbo. And if she isn’t, maybe it would be better if she was. I mean, I think about myself as SCP-3009-C nowadays. Isn’t that fucked up? I shouldn’t think of myself as an acronym and a number sequence. I’m a person, for god’s sake. But even I’m not sure that I’m "Stacey" anymore. At least there’s no doubt that I’m 3009-C.

> But… what are they going to do if they decide she’s real and I’m not, and work out how to put her --back in her-- into my body? What happens to //me//?

//Excerpt from Psychological Evaluation 3009.2, written post Experiment 3009-B-5 and dated ██/06/2018, by Researcher Benedict Kim and Dr. Geraldine Young, the primary counsellor for both SCP-3009 and SCP-3009-C://

> Despite initially demonstrating a fundamentally similar-to-identical base personalities, SCP-3009 and SCP-3009-C have demonstrated extremely divergent progression in terms of their psychological profiles.
> 
> SCP-3009 has narcissistic tendencies, demonstrating a somewhat inflated sense of its own importance as well as a need for excessive admiration. It shows no sign of any other mental health issues representing any potential risk to Foundation goals. Thus far, it remains adamant about its real identity as "Stacey Lee". All behaviour has correlated strongly with Lee’s reported personality traits. 
> 
> Meanwhile, SCP-3009-C has displayed symptoms of moderate depressive disorder since entering Foundation custody. Cooperation with Foundation goals has been consistent but reluctant, and overall behaviour has been inconsistent with reported behaviour of Stacey Lee prior to emergence of the anomaly. Following Experiment 3009-B-5, SCP-3009-C has begun demonstrating signs of dissociation. Additionally, depressive symptoms have worsened. SCP-3009-C has notably ceased, for the most part, all claims to be the original Stacey Lee. It is recommended that medication prescribed to SCP-3009-C be increased.
> 
> At this time, it is unclear whether the difference in progression of SCP-3009-C’s mental state in comparison to SCP-3009 (despite similar base personalities) is conclusive evidence regarding the anomalous properties of SCP-3009-C. The results of this are unfortunately confounded by the difference in circumstance surrounding the subjects. SCP-3009-C’s deviances from reported behaviour and apparent dissociation seems to be at least moderately strong evidence for it possessing anomalous properties, even if SCP-3009-C itself is not aware of this. At the same time, however, they could also quite plausibly be interpreted as mere evidence of trauma experienced by an unfortunate teenaged girl.
> 
> The continued containment of SCP-3009-C therefore represents a difficult moral quandary for the Foundation and the Ethics Committee. It is impossible to tell at this point whether SCP-3009-C has anomalous properties or not. Strong evidence exists pointing in both directions. Furthermore, any such anomalous properties which might be discovered in the future seem unlikely to be substantially dangerous. It is obvious by now that SCP-3009-C does not represent the possibility of a world ending event. 
> 
> Nonetheless, the Foundation has a duty to "secure, contain and protect" anomalies, dangerous or not. Thus regardless of SCP-3009-C's likely harmlessness, the only course of action consistent with the Foundation's mission is to maintain containment of SCP-3009-C. As such, it is recommended that the Foundation continue to hold SCP-3009-C in custody for further evaluation for the indefinite future.

//UPDATE: As of ██/08/2018, SCP-3009-C has been placed on suicide watch.//
