++ **__About me__**:

I have been lurking for years, during my time at law school especially but in October of 2019 I decided to try my hand at writing an article.  I was drawn to this site after reading [[[SCP-2480]]] and realizing what a wonderful creative outlet this would be.^^Especially because a lawyer doesn't often have time for creative writing in their career.^^

So far I'm focused on historical and supernatural fiction //(probably more ominous than actual horror, if I'm honest)// and I have a bit of an overarching narrative reaching out through the skips I've written.  Hopefully that continues.  Let's see together, shall we?

++ **__"Series"__**:[[footnote]]I say series, but there's only two currently and neither of them are tales?  But they connect and should be read in order, if you want the maximum experience... although you could read them separately as well.[[/footnote]]

* [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4612 |SCP-4612]]]: //Not all Gods Decompose//[[footnote]]This was my first attempt at writing an article, its still my most successful to date.[[/footnote]]
//Concerning an old manor in Yorkshire that is hiding a strange cadaver and the Foundation trying to use a psychic to investigate.//

* [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-5512 |SCP-5512]]]: //A Social Contract//[[footnote]]My third article on the wiki.[[/footnote]]
//Concerning a UIU investigation of a small cult in Boston in 1992.//

//My first addition to the Sarkic lore, it concerns a Foundation site that went missing, and what happened to the staff and last humanoid anomaly housed there.//
