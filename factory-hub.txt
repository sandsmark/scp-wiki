+ The Factory

The Factory is a poorly-understood entity or group of entities of indeterminate origin stationed primarily in the midwestern U.S. and several countries with poor labor laws. It's reported to have been founded in 1835 by UTE-0561-Venice Green, whose current location is unknown. Its management is comprised of ostensibly sapient entities which have yet to be satisfactorily described or photographed.

**Structure:** No definitive information is available regarding their internal organization at this time. It is believed that the Factory operates loosely corresponding with similar non-anomalous corporations.

**Resources:** The Factory appears to be self-funded through the sales of various mass-produced anomalies.

**Standing Orders:** Engage as soon as possible. Operatives of the Factory are to be considered KTEs, Response Level 3 by default, 4 if actively aggressive.

The Robber Barons are believed to be a trans-universal concept which maintains great difficulty in movement between realities^^1^^. The first recorded appearance of the Robber Barons was in Γ-7382, year 5720 EV, in which the Barons manifested as a small restaurant which did not sell food^^2^^. From Γ-7382, the Barons slowly infected further universes with no known pattern, with the sole exception that expansion takes between 500-2000 years. 

In all known incarnations, the Robber Barons appear as a twisted and corrupted amalgamation of recent successful businesses and organizations^^3^^. The Barons are tended to and managed by Foremen, who are equally a corrupted amalgamation of business magnates and managers. In every incarnation of its form, the Barons hire their workers from the local populace with promises of their needs being taken care of by the company. 

Her workers are abandoned after they submit to the Barons, and are left to be torn apart by the rusted contraptions without intervention from their superiors. In its present form, the Barons rely on outside sources for raw materials which are assembled by man and machine alike on conveyor belts.

Area that the event took place in. Generally speaking, Factory formats focus on events that occur in their factories, though other locations can be used.
Factory-owned areas are designated by stating the compass direction and the country/county/state the Factory is in, followed by what purpose the building serves. E.G. "Northwestern Idaho Manufacturing Center".[[footnote]] The footnote of this section lists the Location ID, which is formatted as the initials following the geographical location, and further followed by an arbitrary seven-digit numerical designation.
