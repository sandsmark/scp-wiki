**Item #:** SCP-1941

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to its location, SCP-1941 is uncontainable for the time being. Of highest priority is the development of more advanced lunar reconnaissance orbiters to continue to track its progress, as well as a lunar retrieval mission to procure a sample for study. For the moment, the phenomenon is not visible from the Earth, making a cover story unnecessary.

**Description:** SCP-1941 is a manifestation that was first discovered on May 28, 2000 when attention was drawn to what was assumed to be a small comet impacting 500km south-east of Jackson crater in the Northern hemisphere of the far side of the moon. Since its discovery, evidence of rapid industrial activity and exponential growth have emerged.

The currently deployed Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter's (LRO) resolving power is insufficient to determine what exactly is responsible. However, anomalously high temperatures and spectroscopy results suggest that strip-mining, refining, smelting and fabrication are taking place. In addition, neutrino activity consistent with controlled nuclear fusion has been detected.

It has been conjectured that a technologically sophisticated alien probe is responsible for SCP-1941. Such a probe (known as a Von Neumann probe) would be able to make use of available raw materials in its environment in order to replicate itself. When enough copies had been produced, it could then turn its attention to some longer term goal.

In the decade since it was discovered, the area the phenomenon encompasses has grown by a factor of 3.5, giving it an estimated doubling rate of 7 years. It currently occupies an area of 25,000 km^^2^^. If it continues to spread at the same rate, it will begin to be visible from Earth in August of 2031. The entire moon's surfaced would be covered by 2044.

**Addendum** Beginning in June of 2002, transmissions from the site were detected. They consisted of a bootstrap linguistic program that established a small mathematical vocabulary, followed by a particular number and a request for its prime factors. It is currently unknown what the consequences are of either transmitting or failing to transmit these factors. Unfortunately, the number in question is intractably large and not amenable to factorization in any reasonable amount of time. 

It is not known if the difficulty posed by such a mathematical problem is meant as an intelligence test, or if the civilization responsible for SCP-1941 has drastically over-estimated humanity's abilities. The possibility exists that this is meant to measure a civilization's sophistication and to judge the level of resistance they could bring to bear if SCP-1941's intentions turn out to be hostile. 
Â 
What follows is the equation for the number in question: 

> [[size larger ]] [[$ 2^{2^{79}} + 3^{2^{83}} + 5^{2^{89}} + 7^{2^{97}} $]] [[/size]]
