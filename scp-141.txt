**Item #:** SCP-141

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:**
When not in use, SCP-141 is to be stored inside a locked safe in Site 76. Access to this safe requires security level clearance 3 or higher and written approval to use SCP-141. When SCP-141 is in use, either for implementation in accordance with Foundation goals, or for research purposes, it is to be kept within the possession of the assigned researcher at all times. Failure to account for SCP-141 will result in a severe reprimand.

While SCP-141’s ability to cause problems for the Foundation is limited, it could still be a tempting target for certain subversive groups or opportunistic users. For this reason SCP-141 is to be checked out for no more than one week at a time.

**Description:**
SCP-141 is a small leather-bound codex dating back to Roman times, easily carried in one hand. Despite its great age, it never acquires any additional signs of wear and tear beyond a somewhat aged-looking cover. Its thin papyrus pages are always crisp, and so far have proven difficult to tear from the codex’s binding. All attempts at radiocarbon dating have failed; the judgment of SCP-141 as being Roman in origin was initially based upon its appearance, but later confirmed through extensive research using SCP-141 corroborated by historical records. The title of the codex appears to the //Codex Damnatio//, based upon the text on its spine.

SCP-141’s pages are written in Roman Republic-era Latin. It appears to be a detailed description of notes and summations for a wide range of legal trials. This first half contains a series of historic trials from throughout history- the earliest trial appears to be from the proscriptions of the late Roman Republic, while the most recent case is the [DATA REDACTED] taking place in 20██. Each case summary is rendered in astonishing detail, with precise witness quotations, exact physical descriptions of evidence and their import to the case, and so on.

The codex actually contains far more legal cases than its one hundred and fifty pages could possibly allow; a reader must make a detailed reference to a range or specific case to discover if it is listed inside. If it is, the pages will transform into those relating to the specified case. This tends to require either a deep knowledge of legal history from a variety of civilizations, as the codex, strangely enough, also includes cases from outside Europe as early as ████, and/or a detailed historical background. Research with SCP-141 conducted by Professor ██████ has revealed that SCP-141 has apparently been used in, among other important periods, a wide variety of Roman proscriptions, heretical trials of the Catholic Church including the conviction of [DATA REDACTED], the Spanish Inquisition, and the witch hunts of the 17th century, as well as the Red Scare of the mid-20th century.

The latter half of the book is blank, and can be written in with any pen so long as that pen contains black ink. A user of SCP-141 must provide detailed information about a criminal proceeding, including victim, evidence, witness statements, and suspects, and they must do so in Republic-era Latin whenever possible except when comparative terms simply do not exist. 

When this information is provided to SCP-141, the particulars of the case described in SCP-141 appear to become “true.” Though the suspect did not actually commit the crime, witnesses’ memories and testimony will correspond to the information written in SCP-141, and they will believe this to be the utmost truth. Even falsified evidence, such as murder weapons, traces of the target’s blood or other incriminating substances, or incriminating documents, appears to spring into existence, appearing in the court record or at the scene of the crime. 

SCP-141 does appear able to induce criminal activities that would not have taken place, although this requires even more precise wording and description of the particulars. The “guilty” party specified by SCP-141 can in some cases have a false memory implanted that corresponds with SCP-141’s account of events, although inducing this result has proven to require a subtle wording and clever writing of the scenario. These memories do not overwrite the original ones, but they do seem quite nearly as real.

Care must be taken by a careful user to ensure as many loopholes are closed as possible. While SCP-141’s falsifications will stand up to all but the most critical of examinations, it will only produce precisely the memories and evidence that is written inside it. It will not compensate for imperfections in the account of the case the user provides. Nonetheless, successfully employed, SCP-141 is an almost surefire conviction. How SCP-141 accomplishes this effect remains unknown.

**Addendum [SCP-141a]:**
Tests are ongoing to determine if SCP-141 is capable of exonerating an innocent man wrongly convicted, or if changing the results during the trial has any measurable effect. Approval to employ SCP-141 in a “test case” is pending. 

**Addendum [SCP-141b]:**
//Damn it, people, this is not a toy. SCP-141 is not to be employed as a means of revenge. I don’t care if he talked during the movie, or if that guy cut you off in traffic; these are people’s lives we’re dealing with here.//

//To give credit where credit is due, I must applaud Agent ████████’s creativity, even misused. I hadn’t even considered using farm equipment that way. I’m sure he won’t mind if I write his name in here…//
- Professor ██████

**Addendum [SCP-141c]:**
//No. You are not to use this as a way to ensure those people end up as D-Class personnel either.//
- Professor ██████
