**Item #:** SCP-3082

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** The suburban locale surrounding SCP-3082 and the private property associated with the anomaly itself are to remain in the Foundation's ownership, functioning as a Site-11 satellite facility. In order to more easily preserve the appearance of an unremarkable neighborhood, it is recommended that Foundation personnel inhabit residences in the vicinity of SCP-3082. 

The ladder granting access to SCP-3082 is to be removed when not in use. 

Personnel must maintain diplomatic relations with the human population of SCP-3082-1. In the interest of perpetuating goodwill, personnel are not to interfere with internal conflicts among residents of the anomaly. 

The population of the village designated SCP-3082-1-ϴ may request that the Foundation provide certain items. Requests for clothing, entertainment devices, and media may be fulfilled at the discretion of authorized staff. The provision of livestock, pets, tools, food, beverage, and/or other items must be approved by a Level 4 supervisor and endorsed by the village's "chief royal council".[[footnote]] The self-proclaimed "chief royal council" is an oligarchical governing assembly of 7 civically engaged and relatively well-respected residents of SCP-3082-1-ϴ.

**Description:** SCP-3082 is a 2 m by 2 m by 2 m treehouse located in the mid-western United States. The object is made of cherry wood planks. SCP-3082 is also a 4 m by 5 m by 2.5 m maple wood treehouse cabin located in an evergreen section of SCP-3082-1. In this form, the object appears to have been constructed in the Greek revival architectural style. 

SCP-3082's two forms are connected by a 1 meter by 1.3 meter hatch on an interior wall of the object. The hatch serves as the access point to and from a stable, Earth-like pocket dimension containing neither large fauna nor sentient native inhabitants. This external reality is centered around SCP-3082-1. 

Measuring an estimated 160 km tall, SCP-3082-1 is an extreme megaflorum and arboreal organism displaying numerous traits from a large variety of identifiable plants seemingly grafted onto it. Sampling and analysis have determined that sections of SCP-3082-1 which resemble various plant species are genetically identical to non-anomalous specimens. Analysis of bark samples taken from transition areas between one plant species and another has revealed [DATA REDACTED]. 

Conifers (//Pinophyta//) and flowering deciduous trees are the most common phenotypical features in the portion of SCP-3082-1's geography that has been documented by the Foundation. Approximately 10% of documented plants are edible or bear fruit edible to humans. The most notable graft organism observed of the many that make up SCP-3082-1 is an anomalous species of pitcher plant (//Nepenthes//) which contains fresh water in its pitcher cups [[footnote]] 0.2 to 0.3 L of water per pitcher [[/footnote]] rather than trap fluid.

SCP-3082-1 appears to be the sole major vertical structure within its extradimensional space. Long-range imaging has revealed only flat terrain and decaying plant life extending out from the organism's base for at least 3000 km. Despite great altitude variation, atmospheric pressure remains largely consistent (averaging 101 kPa) throughout the pocket reality. Temperate weather patterns exist in the local vicinity of SCP-3082-1. Researchers have determined that the organism receives approximately 1300 mm of annual precipitation on average. [[footnote]] This amount of rainfall has been determined to be gravely insufficient to sustain a plant organism of SCP-3082-1's mass. Researchers postulate that SCP-3082-1 either retains or generates additional water through anomalous means. [[/footnote]] 

Living within the pocket dimension are 74 human children of American nationality ranging from 4 to 12 years old. 73 of these subjects currently reside in a village of treehouses, henceforth designated SCP-3082-1-ϴ, located in a section of SCP-3082-1's uppermost branches. Each individual claims to have suddenly appeared on the porch of SCP-3082 after fleeing from an abusive household. Neither the children nor their possessions appear to physically age or deteriorate. Investigation has positively identified these children as the subjects of missing person reports from 1996 through modern day. 

SCP-3082-1-ϴ is situated approximately 120 meters from the location of SCP-3082 within the pocket reality. A series of platforms and rope bridges [[footnote]] The original rope bridges traversing the branches of SCP-3082-1 at the time of the anomaly's discovery were unable to safely hold more than 130 kg at a time. The Foundation has since replaced the majority of these with new structures rated for 1500+ kg. [[/footnote]] lead from the access point to the village without detour. The tree forts of SCP-3082-1-ϴ are of notably cruder construction than SCP-3082. Corroborated statements from the chronologically oldest residents of the village indicate that the object was present prior to when subjects began appearing. 

The residents of SCP-3082-1-ϴ are prevented from entering the access point in SCP-3082 by a reportedly glass-like barrier unobservable by human subjects age 13 and older. 

Two distinct political factions have arisen within SCP-3082-1-ϴ as an indirect result of Foundation interference. The presently larger camp has expressed support for research efforts toward the goal of releasing the village residents from the pocket reality. The smaller group, which calls itself the "Neverland movement", has declared opposition to the Foundation's planned resettlement of the subjects to normal reality should a viable means of cross-dimensional transportation be found.

Following the establishment of diplomatic relations with the governing assembly of SCP-3082-1-ϴ, residents of the village provided Foundation personnel with lodgings on the outskirts of their community. 

Both manned and unmanned explorations of SCP-3082-1 are directed from this location.

With an average radius of 0.8 m and an estimated depth of 3 m, the site of SCP-3082-2's encampment at the time of the Foundation's first encounter with it was a tree hollow located [[footnote]] [2.12 radians clockwise, 20 km inward, -50 km vertical] from reference point SCP-3082 [0 radians, 0 km inward, 0 km vertical]. [[/footnote]] on a primary branch of SCP-3082-1. The subject [[footnote]] See "Residents" case files for information regarding the subject designated SCP-3082-2 [[/footnote]] had established a temporary base in this location less than three hours prior to when visual contact was achieved by a remotely piloted exploration drone (ID# AEXD-1348).

**Name:** Aria Morrison

**Designation:** SCP-3082-2

**Bio:** Born 7 January 1984 in █████, Ohio, Aria Morrison was labeled a missing person 12 August 1996. The subject's parents are deceased. It has one younger sister by the name of Jacquelyn Morrison, also reported missing 12 August 1996, whose whereabouts are unknown. [[footnote]] Speculation that Jacquelyn Morrison currently resides within SCP-3082's pocket reality is unconfirmed. [[/footnote]]

Corroborated statements from the chronologically oldest of the village children have indicated that SCP-3082-2 was already present in the pocket dimension when SCP-3082-1-A first arrived. It is believed that the subject acted as leader of SCP-3082-1-ϴ until a point in time approximately five months before the Foundation's discovery of SCP-3082. When questioned, SCP-3082-1-A and SCP-3082-1-B have claimed that SCP-3082-2 abandoned the village in order to [DATA REDACTED].

This subject has been designated SCP-3082-2 due to its suspected connection to the anomalous properties of SCP-3082 and SCP-3082-1. It is currently wanted for interrogation.

**Affiliated project/personnel authorization:**

> **Project Galileo Mission Statement:** Documentation of SCP-3082-1 on a larger scale must be performed for two reasons:
> # To improve scientific understanding of the biology of SCP-3082-1 in order to investigate its origins.
> # To gain a comprehensive grasp of the structure of the organism in order to facilitate human exploration and manned operations beyond SCP-3082-1-ϴ.
> 
> This project's operational team has been allocated the use of 4 AEXD drones (ID# AEXD-1346 through AEXD-1349) to accomplish these goals to the best of its ability. 

**Proof of loss:**

> **Incident Report #3082-2-A:** At 14:23 local time on 14/07/2017, the operator of AEXD-1348 piloted the drone into a previously undocumented section of SCP-3082-1 during standard exploration procedures. Exploration continued normally until 14:35, when the drone encountered a tree hollow in an oak section of SCP-3082-1. 
> 
> This tree hollow was the second such discovered example of physiological damage to the megaflorum. Closer investigation was deemed pertinent to research operations, and so the drone operator piloted AEXD-1348 nearer to the location of interest. 
> 
> Upon approach, movement was observed within the hollow's interior. Continued observation led to visual contact with and positive identification of subject SCP-3082-2, Aria Morrison, at time 14:42. 
> 
> SCP-3082-2 appeared physically healthy and uninjured. Its attire at the time of the encounter was composed of a white T-shirt, short denim overalls, and white sneakers, all matching the description of the clothing it was last seen wearing before being labeled a missing person. The subject also seemed to be in possession of a red knapsack within its temporary base in the tree hollow.
> 
> Due to close proximity, AEXD-1348 soon became noticed by the subject. SCP-3082-2's immediate reaction to the sight of the drone has been described as that of astonishment. After recovering from its initial surprise, SCP-3082-2 began waving and calling out to the AEXD unit.
> 
> The drone operator was ordered not to engage with the subject as the Project Galileo team awaited the arrival of its supervisor. With AEXD-1348 at 11% battery, the operator attempted to have the drone withdraw to the nearest branch of SCP-3082-1 from which it could maintain view of the tree hollow while conserving power.
> 
> At time 14:44, SCP-3082-2 displayed signs of distress at the drone's apparent retreat. It began pounding its hands against the interior of the tree hollow and making soft vocalizations which were indistinct to the AEXD unit's microphone. 
> 
> At time 14:45, AEXD-1348's third rotor was struck by a falling, moderately dense object later determined to have been a small watermelon. The drone subsequently flew into the lowermost branches of a maple section of SCP-3082-1. Immediately following this, there occurred rapid, targeted ivy growth in the vicinity of the drone's crash site. It is believed that this ivy became entangled in the rotors of the AEXD unit, preventing its escape. 
> 
> At time 14:48, AEXD-1348 experienced emergency system shutdown due to overheating detected in its flight motors. Subsequent attempts to remotely restore communications with the drone have failed.

**Foreword:** //The following transcript logs a broadcast received from AEXD-1348 several days after Incident #3082-2-A.//
 
**<Begin Log>**

[A blurry image of SCP-3082-2 appears. The camera lens is focusing on a blueberry plant behind the subject.]

**SCP-3082-2:** Hello?

[The camera attempts to sharpen in on the subject. The subject's facial features become recognizable but still remain out of focus. The sound of running motors joins the audio feed.]

**SCP-3082-2:** I hope you're getting this... Um. If you can see or hear me, can you stop spinning the helicopter motor things? I, uh, took three fan blades off. But they were already kinda broken before that. 

[The sound of the drone's motors ceases. The subject smiles.]

**SCP-3082-2:** You're receiving me! [laughing] Oh, this is great!

[Sighing in apparent relief, the subject begins consuming blueberries stored in the front pocket of its overalls.]

**SCP-3082-2:** Hi. [gives a small wave] My name's Aria Morrison. I've been here -- in this giant tree world, I mean -- for a while. There's probably a missing kid report on me back outside. It'd be from 1996. [shrugging] Yeah, I still look the same. I have some, uh, questions for you. Can you spin this gadget's blades one time for "no" and two times for "yes"?

[The drone is heard activating its motors twice in quick succession.]

**SCP-3082-2:** This is fantastic. It's so good to talk to someone other than the tree. Hey, uh, just to be sure... Are you an adult? You're not just some other kid who showed up in the village with technology from, like, 2018, right? Oh, um, say "yes" if you're a grown-up.

**AEXD-1348:** [YES]

[In an apparently celebratory mood, the subject claps its hand together.]

**SCP-3082-2:** Are you in the village? With the kids?

**AEXD-1348:** [YES]

**SCP-3082-2:** Are they doing okay? Is Rachel in charge?

**AEXD-1348:** [YES] [NO]
 
**SCP-3082-2:** So... Rachel isn't in charge, but the village is alright?

**AEXD-1348:** [YES]

**SCP-3082-2:** Okay... Are //you// in charge of the village?

**AEXD-1348:** [NO]

**SCP-3082-2:** Alright. Are you just one person, or are you, like, with an organization? "Yes" for the first answer, "no" for the second.

**AEXD-1348:** [NO]
 
**SCP-3082-2:** Are you the government?

**AEXD-1348:** [YES] [NO]
 
**SCP-3082-2:** Um... Does that mean "kinda"?

**AEXD-1348:** [YES]

[The subject pauses, contemplating something. After several moments, it reaches for the drone and lifts it up, turning the device around to face a birch sample of SCP-3082-1. Letters, dots, and dashes, a facsimile of Morse code, are written in black and blue crayon on the birch bark.]

**SCP-3082-2:** I couldn't find speakers anywhere on this gadget, so I figured you'd need some other way to say more than "yes" and "no". This is my version of Morse code. Run the motor forward the way you have been for a dot and run it backward for a dash. I hope you can take pictures with the camera on this thing. 

**AEXD-1348:** [YES]

**SCP-3082-2:** You got it?

**AEXD-1348:** [YES]

**SCP-3082-2:** Okay.

[The subject sets the drone back down and turns the camera to face it. Glancing at the cloudy sky, the subject frowns.]

**SCP-3082-2:** I think it's going to rain soon. I'll have to put this gadget away in a little while.

**AEXD-1348:** [DRONE IS WATERPROEF]

[The subject adopts an expression of confusion.]

**SCP-3082-2:** Drone?
 
**AEXD-1348:** [GADGET] [WHAAT DID YOU DO TO IT]

**SCP-3082-2:** Oh. So this thing's called a drone. Um... Maybe it was waterproof before, but it's... kinda beat up now. I reattached the camera by taking wires from something that didn't look as, uh, important. Lucky me, I had duct tape and a pocket knife in my bag. Since we're talking and stuff, it must've been enough to fix everything that I needed to fix.

[The subject pauses.]

**SCP-3082-2:** I really do need to put you -- well, the drone -- away now, but I wanna ask one more question: Who are you?

**AEXD-1348:** [WE ARE SCP FOUNDATION]

**SCP-3082-2:** So that's your organization's name? Hm. I've never heard of you before, but it's nice to meet you, SCP Foundation. I'll try to call again soon. 

**<End Log>**

**Closing Statement:** //The Project Galileo team has been unable to determine AEXD-1348's current location. It has been deemed likely that SCP-3082-2 removed wires from the AEXD unit's locator beacon in its repair of the drone's camera connection.//

**Interviewed:** SCP-3082-2

**Interviewer:** Project Galileo operational team (through AEXD-1348)
 
**Foreword:** //The following interaction occurred 44 hours after SCP-3082-2's prior transmission. The Project Galileo team became thoroughly well-versed in the subject's Morse code facsimile during that time as preparation.//

**<Begin Log>**

[Visual feed opens on SCP-3082-2 in the branches of a willow section of SCP-3082-1.]

**SCP-3082-2:** Hello? Are you there, SCP Foundation?

**AEXD-1348:** [YES]

[The subject laughs.]

**SCP-3082-2:** Hah, you don't have to spell that out. Stick with the old way. It's not hard to figure out when you mean letters and when you mean "yes" or "no".

**AEXD-1348:** [OK]

**SCP-3082-2:** Cool. It's good to talk again. Nice, sunny weather today, so I think we'll be fine for a while. Anyway... I guess you guys found the tree house in the real world? The one that the kids here can't get into?

**AEXD-1348:** [YES]

**SCP-3082-2:** When did you find out about this place?

**AEXD-1348:** [FIVE MONTHS AFTER YOU LEFT]

**SCP-3082-2:** Since then? Huh. So... you probably know a lot about me, but I don't know much of anything about you. I have some more questions to ask.

**AEXD-1348:** [OK]

**SCP-3082-2:** I'm dying to know -- what does "SCP" stand for? Stark, Curry, and Parker? Super Cooking Pantry? Sandy's Comic Place?

[The Foundation's response is slightly delayed.]

**AEXD-1348:** ... [SECURE CONTAIN PROTECT]

**SCP-3082-2:** Oh. Well, that's more interesting that the names I was thinking of. What does it mean?

**AEXD-1348:** [IT IS OUR JOB] [MISSION]

**SCP-3082-2:** Your... mission? What exactly do you guys do?

**AEXD-1348:** [WE RESEARCH] [KEEP WORLD SAFE] [PROTECT PEOPLE FROM PARANORMAL] 

**SCP-3082-2:** The paranormal. You mean things like this place?

**AEXD-1348:** [YES]

[The subject pauses.]

**SCP-3082-2:** ... I get it. So it's like you're Area 51: the secret agency that collects sci-fi stuff and experiments on aliens.

**AEXD-1348:** [YES]

[The subject displays agitated behavior.]

**SCP-3082-2:** Okay. Great. I, uh, think I should keep moving now. There's nothing to eat where I am, so... I'll call you later. Bye.

**Interviewed:** SCP-3082-2

**Interviewer:** Project Galileo operational team (through AEXD-1348)

**Foreword:** //The following interview took place 9 days after the previous.//

**<Begin Log>**

[Visual feed opens on SCP-3082-2 in the branches of a maple section of SCP-3082-1. The subject behaves distractedly, often tugging at its hair or fiddling with its overall straps.]

**SCP-3082-2:** Hi.

**AEXD-1348:** [YES]

**SCP-3082-2:** Yeah... There's not really anything I wanted to talk about. I was just feeling kinda lonely. 

[The subject appears lost in thought. AEXD-1348 spins its motors to reclaim the subject's attention.]

**SCP-3082-2:** Sorry. Were you trying to say something?

**AEXD-1348:** [WE HAVE QUESTIONS]

**SCP-3082-2:** Ah. Of course you do. Okay, shoot.

**AEXD-1348:** [HOW DID YOU CAPTURE DRONE]

[Adopting a conflicted expression, the subject bites its lower lip nervously.]

**SCP-3082-2:** Um... Would you believe me if I said I have magic plant powers?

[The Foundation's response is delayed.]

**AEXD-1348:** ... [NO] 

[Hesitation is displayed by the subject.]

**AEXD-1348:** [HOW CAPTURE DRONE] [WHY LEAVE VILLAGE]

**SCP-3082-2:** I... Well... Do you guys share what I say? Like, with the kids in the village? Or the government or anything?

**AEXD-1348:** [NO] [NO OTHERS KNOW WE FOUND YOU]

**SCP-3082-2:** Is it going to, y'know, stay that way?

**AEXD-1348:** [YES]

**SCP-3082-2:** ...Okay. I'm going to tell you guys something that I've never told anyone before. It's a long story, but someone needs to know this in case I don't, y'know, make it... Some of the other kids figured out half of it. Maybe they told you or maybe you found the police report -- about my sister?

**AEXD-1348:** [JACQUELYN]

[The subject removes its backpack and holds it close to its chest. It nods its head.]

**SCP-3082-2:** Yeah. Jackie. 

[Holding its backpack a little closer to itself, the subject faintly smiles.]

**SCP-3082-2:** This was her bag. She was the one who brought duct tape when we decided to run away together. [chuckling] I used to tell her that it could fix anything -- she never believed me, but she thought to bring it anyway. Silly, right? Heh... 

[The subject sighs.]

**SCP-3082-2:** [taking on a softer tone of voice] I was twelve when we left, and she was seven. I know that I still //look// like I'm twelve, but it's been decades since then, really... Um. Before I go on, I need to tell you something that's kinda hard to believe. 

**AEXD-1348:** [OK]

**SCP-3082-2:** My sister was special. Sometimes, when she wanted something to be true, it would actually happen -- even if it was impossible. One time, I told her that our parents left us home alone on her birthday because... because there was going to be a surprise party in the park on her //half//-birthday. I said there'd be half a chocolate cake waiting for her in a big bouncy house. Six months later, after I'd forgotten about that, we went to the park... and it was all just like I'd described it to her. She wasn't surprised at all. Said she knew it'd be there.

[The subject pauses.]

**SCP-3082-2:** When we played in the woods, she liked to invent places. Pyramids. Jungles. Sandcastles. I would blink or look away, and suddenly they'd, um, be there. She made herself into a mermaid once. At the end of our games, I always told her that things should go back to the way they were supposed to be. And everything magical would disappear, and it'd be like nothing ever happened. Do you believe me?

**AEXD-1348:** [YES]

**SCP-3082-2:** Right. [frowning] You probably see weirder stuff all the time. 

[Silence falls.]

**AEXD-1348:** [CONTINUE]

**SCP-3082-2:** Oh, yeah. Sorry. I got a little distracted. What was I saying...? Right... It was after our parents had a really big fight -- me and my sister ran away together. We went into the woods behind our house, where we always used to play, and we just... kept walking. After half an hour... we were scared. Scared to keep going //and// scared to go back. I looked away for one second...

[The subject draws a shuddering breath and turns to the side, no longer facing the drone.]

**SCP-3082-2:** I looked away. And when I looked back, she wasn't there, and I was standing on the porch of a tree fort cabin. There weren't any bridges or platforms back then. It was just me in that tree house... in a tree so big I didn't know where it started. Me. All by myself. 

[The subject closes its eyes.]

**SCP-3082-2:** I'm not embarrassed to say that I cried. A lot. And I got thirsty and lonely... and I pretended that Jackie was there to listen to a bedtime story about pitcher plants full of water. The next morning, I found rope bridges and platforms going from the cabin to a... a grove place. Where the village is now. The pitcher plants were all over the place there. And there was fruit nearby. Lots of fruit. 

**SCP-3082-2:** A little while later, Rachel showed up. And then Ahmed. I told them a little bit about Jackie. Later, we figured out that more kids would keep coming, so... we started building a, uh, a place for them. You should know all the rest already. 

[Glancing at the branches above its head, the subject reaches up and tugs at a leaf.]

**SCP-3082-2:** The tree does what I ask when it's feeling up to it. That's how I got this drone out of the air: I asked for it. [sighs] I still look twelve years old. My sister... she doesn't really look seven anymore. Or act the same. Not even close. She likes it too much, here in... well, Wexley calls it Neverland. I think Jackie might listen better if I get closer to the part of her that remembers, but for now... she just doesn't hear me when I say that it's time to go home. 

**AEXD-1348:** [EXPLAIN]

[Shaking its head sadly, the subject begins reaching over the camera's view and toward the drone's battery. It appears unwilling to continue the conversation.]

**SCP-3082-2:** Trees don't really think like people do.

**<End Log>**

**Closing Statement:** //SCP-3082-2 has yet to contact the Foundation again since this interaction.//
