//You sit down in your office chair.//

You look down the hallway
At the hundreds of skips’ cells,
(Roars throughout the dark hallway)
Reminded of all the work to do
To keep your world safe from harm.

//You walk down and observe a test.//

They’re seeing how 682 feeds.
It’s given a lamb and some steel;
682 consumes the plate instantly,
Digesting both as it would Earth.
But it is returned to containment.

//You walk down and observe a test.//

They’re seeing how strong 173 is.
It’s given a horse and an elephant;
173 snaps them both in the dark,
Standing in their blood in the light.
But it is returned to containment.

//You sit down to analyze the tests.//


//You get a phone call at your desk.//

Your home has been robbed;
Your wife and daughter murdered.
The suspect is your neighbor’s son,
He was caught raping their bodies.

//You thank the officer for the call.//

You look down the hallway, again,
At the couple of skips’ pens,
(Rustles throughout the light hallway)
Reminded of all the work to do
To keep your world safe from harm.

//So, you walk home to analyze a test.//
