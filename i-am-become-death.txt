[[size 125%]]I saw a god last night.[[/size]]
@@ @@
[[size 125%]]I dreamt he had come to me, appearing by my bedside. I could not move, for I was blinded by his glorious visage. He told me of a new world, a new dawn, and that I would take part in it. He felt my skepticism in my mind, and assured me that I would see the signs.[[/size]]

[[size 125%]]His visit was short, barely a few seconds. I remained wondering if I was in a dream, and I still wondered when I first awoke.[[/size]]

@@ @@
[[size 125%]]I saw him in shadows, in mirrors, at my vision's edge. He is certainly real, though I cannot explain how I know, I can only feel. But his presence is strong. Sometimes, when my back is turned and I sit still, it feels as though he is over my shoulder, watching my work. I could touch him, but I do not dare.[[/size]]

[[size 125%]]He only appears when I am in study, but I do not know what studies of mine he would find interest in. But I feel a sense of comfort when he is near. I am grateful.[[/size]]

[[size 125%]]The god has begun to speak to me again, and what joy I feel.[[/size]]
@@ @@
[[size 125%]]He says his name is Vishnu, like the Hindu god. I have read of him in the Gita. The revelation surprised me somewhat; Vishnu is often described as nigh-alien in appearance, but the entity that guides me seems like a man. But I learned not to question it; he is a god, and gods appear as they please. His appearance is irrelevant. I feel his power, his love, his wisdom. Being near him is like entering a warm home, after walking in the snow. Indeed, his wisdom stands in stark contrast to the ignorance of the world.[[/size]]
@@ @@
[[size 125%]]His words are soothing, and happy. I have never felt more inspired than when Vishnu speaks to me. My mind expands tenfold. I see the infinite capacity of science, but I see the even further knowledge of what is beyond. For moments, I can see the realms of gods, of monsters. Those things that walk among us.[[/size]]
@@ @@
[[size 125%]]I have discovered so much, beyond what any man has found before. But I must not be too arrogant. What I have done, I have done through Vishnu, because I have trusted him. He has guided me so far, and he can continue to guide me further.[[/size]]

[[size 125%]]I will bring peace, he says. With his guidance, I know I can.[[/size]]
