**Item #:** SCP-1733

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** The DVR containing SCP-1733 to be kept in a secure video archive at Site-██. Playback of SCP-1733 strictly forbidden unless for research purposes. Personnel must contact Dr. Geller for permission to study SCP-1733.

**Description**: SCP-1733 is a digital recording of the 2010-2011 NBA season opener played at the TD Garden in Boston, Massachusetts on 10/26/2010 between the Boston Celtics and Miami Heat. Agents monitoring social networking sites were alerted to SCP-1733's anomalous nature when Boston native █████ ██████ complained in a Facebook thread on October 26th about a technical foul in the third quarter involving players Ray Allen and Chris Bosh that never occurred. When confronted, █████ ██████ uploaded the relevant segment much to the confusion of his derogators. Foundation agents  embedded in Facebook's moderator team deleted the thread and procured the IP address of █████ ██████ and all involved to locate and administer Class-A amnesiacs. The Motorola brand DVR containing SCP-1733 was recovered for study.

Extensive examination by Foundation researchers has since revealed the nature of the recording's anomalous properties. Although initially diverging from the original broadcast only negligibly, such as quarter point totals and occurrences of fouls, SCP-1733 has begun to markedly digress from the content of its earlier recordings. Recorded entities have been observed to retain a fragmented memory of previous playings, and as such have developed a burgeoning awareness of their existence. It is hypothesized that playbacks impart an unquantifiable measure of cognizance to the entities inhabiting SCP-1733, with consecutive playings greatly contributing to the distress and confusion felt by the crowd and players. This effect is cumulative and extends to all persons in the arena. Quality of awareness has progressed from reported feelings of intense deja vu by commentator personalities Mike & Tommy to a near-eidetic memory of preceding playbacks. However, to note, no entities inside SCP-1733 have ever addressed the viewer directly, or the fact of there residing in a digital recording.

The individuals in the recording are virtually indistinguishable from their real life counterparts in talent, behavior, and mannerisms on court. Fans in the crowd also appear to be functioning human beings in all respects, and Foundation inquiries into the current status of of these persons has found nothing of note. For all intents and purposes, recorded entities appear to be the actual individual but somehow abiding in a digital medium. TD Garden records have put the number of people in attendance on 10/26/2010 at ██████.

It was initially thought the nature of SCP-1733 was to depict a potentially infinite array of game outcomes, as players were able to anticipate the opposing team's strategies and adjust accordingly in every playback. By playback 034, players and coaches became so keenly adapted to the opposing team's playbook the score remained 0-0 until 3:34 in the first quarter. As quality of recall was still weak in early stage iterations, memory of preceding playbacks likely manifested as a vague intuition felt by players, fans, and team personnel alike, rendering them unable to grasp the full scope of their exigency.

By playback 045, however, comprehension of their predicament had reached such a point that players declined to play altogether and joined the rest of the arena assembly in formulating escape plans. It is the conclusion of Dr. Geller the inhabitants of SCP-1733 are imprisoned in the setting of the recording as they have been unable to exit by any means. Doors leading out of the arena have not yielded to an estimated force in excess of █████N. The assembly has also been unable to exit from locker rooms, player facilities, and skyboxes. Waiting for patrons arriving in at scripted points prior to the start of the first quarter has also been unsuccessful: individuals leave by where patrons entered and are then unable to navigate an escape from the adjacent corridors that girdle the main arena. Escape attempts have since grown more desperate, and have included failed attempts at constructing makeshift explosives, all-out rioting, the fracturing of the assembly into three opposing factions, and by playback ███ the ritualistic murder and disembowelment of players in the hopes of appeasing whatever it is that confines them (see Timeline Document 001 for details). However, upon the beginning of a new playback, all persons are returned to their pre-game status unharmed.

Researchers have been unable to duplicate the effects of SCP-1733 with other recordings made by the DVR, confirming the device is not the source of SCP-1733's aberrant properties. Due to the distress visited upon inhabitants of SCP-1733, testing has been suspended indefinitely.

||~ Playback #||||~ Notable Developments||
|| Playback 002 |||| First recorded deviation from recorded broadcast. TD Garden crowd booed the Miami Heat during entrance. Miami Heat Forward Lebron James noted to have scowled at crowd and shake his head dismissively.||
||Playback 015 |||| Score remained 0-0 for eight consecutive possessions. Fans appear noticeably subdued when displayed on the facility's HD scoreboard screen. Celtics power forward Glen Davis is able to make a block late in the fourth quarter on LeBron James he had not previously completed, securing the Celtics lead. Commentators remarked on Glen Davis' commitment to the game and his dedication on both the sides of the court in spite of the "Big Three's blistering ball movement on offensive plays". A nascent awareness of previously played games has begun to form.||
||Playback 026 |||| First Miami Heat victory, 112-85. Crowd became aggressive, shouting obscenities and hurling foodstuffs at the Celtics. Color commentator Tom Heinsohn understood the frustration, criticizing the Celtic's coaching staff for becoming so complacent after having "cracked the code of the Miami Heat offense". As this was the first game debut of the Miami "Big Three", it is exceedingly unlikely any coaching personnel would have attested to having become so adjusted to an unfamiliar offense in one game.||
||Playback 027 |||| Commentators Mike & Tommy noted to have felt a considerable sense of deja vu during the Heat's grandiose entrance. Crowd remained subdued during key Celtics plays. Celtics emerged the victors, prompting Tom Heinsohn to remark "the Celtics have come a long way winning back the hearts of their fans". When asked to elaborate by Mike Gorman, Heinsohn could only respond that he felt the team had an embarrassment to atone for, but could not specify further.||
||Playback 044 |||| Teams emerged disoriented and confused. Game was not played. Majority of time was spent by medical professionals assessing the mental state of players who remained convinced they had dreamt having played the season opener multiple times the previous night. When informed of the situation by team staff, commentators Mike & Tommy affirmed the same feeling. Crowd was also afflicted. Recording ended with courtside correspondents interviewing members of the crowd on the nature of their dreams.||
||Playback 045 |||| Players refused to play. Cameramen, facility personnel, players, commentators, and crowd members gathered in the court to appraise the situation. All persons were convinced they were reliving the same game repeatedly. Doors were tested but could not be budged. Recording closed as crowd began to fashion makeshift weapons to pry open doors. Last instance of camera being manipulated by the camera crew. All following playbacks seen through a single static shot of a broadcast view camera.||
|| Playback 051 |||| No attempts to exit the building have succeeded. All exits remain in the arena and adjacent areas remain sealed. A physical altercation in balcony section 318 between an inebriated group of college-aged males and two older males leaves the one man concussed on the floor and the other unconscious. As broadcast camera is not able to pick up audible voices on opposite side of the arena, presumably the dispute occurred over the group of males not assisting with escape plans. First recorded violent incident.||
||Playback 052 |||| Man knocked unconscious in previous playback is returned to previous state unharmed upon the beginning of current recording. The two males ambush and bludgeon one attacker to death at 34:12 mark.||
||Playback 055 |||| Cognitization has progressed to such a point that the crowd is now able to remember the events of that week, as well as friends and family members outside the facility. Attempts to contact outside for help are met with failure. 
||Playback 065 |||| Crowd is unable to exit the facility. Congregation has since dissolved into the following groups and "factions": players, coaches, and all involved team personnel have presumably barricaded in offscreen player facilities. Elderly persons, parents, and children have retreated to northeast corner of balcony seats and have elected to wait out playbacks as they occur, calling themselves Group 320 for the balcony section they are congregated around. ██ individuals who refer to themselves as the "Faithkeepers" have proselytized to multiple gatherings that they believe being confined to the TD Garden is a punishment for rampant materialism, and have burned "offerings" of mobile phones, car keys, handbags, and wallets in center court for the past four playbacks. The group is comprised of Boston churchgoers and [REDACTED]. College-aged men and women, however, remain diligent in formulating escape plans. 
||Playback 073 |||| The "Faithkeepers" grow in number after previous playback incident, where three males were severely injured by an improvised explosive fastened to an exit door. No damage to the door was visible.
||Playback 095 |||| Hedonistic displays of sex and violence have sufficiently curbed the efforts of proselytizers. Makeshift curtains are hung around the site of an orgy at lower section 8 at the urging of Group 320 members.
||Playback ███ |||| Faithkeepers storm player facilities to retrieve Paul Pierce and LeBron James. The players are ritually disemboweled in a flaming circle of personal possessions, and their severed heads are placed in baskets on opposite sides of the court. Images are displayed on the facility's "Jumb-O-Tron". Murder of players has no effect on the status of their predicament.
||Playback  ███ |||| Proselytizers have begun to call for the sacrifice of children. College-aged men and women have formed a wall between Group 320 and the Faithkeepers. Testing suspended at this point.||
