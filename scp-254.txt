**Item #:** SCP-254

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-254 is to be kept in a standard storage locker when not in use.  When in storage, it must be placed face-down on the floor of the locker and secured with straps to prevent accidental activation.  Use of SCP-254 may be requested by any department head, and must be approved by at least two (2) level-3 personnel.  SCP-254 may not be used in a capacity that will result in SCP-254-1’s contact with SCPs posing a memetic contagion hazard.  Under no circumstances is SCP-254 to be active in a single department or area for longer than twenty-six (26) days.  Reuse is permitted only if the area in question has undergone a complete personnel rotation (i.e. no employees remain who have had previous contact with SCP-254).

**Description:** SCP-254 is a rectangular wooden plaque measuring 22 cm x 30 cm and weighing approximately 1.5 kg.  On the front of the plaque is an empty brass picture holder, as well as a printed metal plate with a black background and gold-colored letters reading “Employee of the Month.”  Affixed to the back of the plaque is a standard hanging device.  

SCP-254 was discovered in the rubble of a Texaco gas station in ██████, Kansas, on ██/██/195█.  A Foundation agent secured SCP-254 after discovering that it had sustained no damage in the explosion that had leveled the gas station and resulted in the deaths of █ employees and ██ civilians .

When SCP-254 is hung on a wall in a work area of 4 or more people, SCP-254-1 will appear soon afterward. SCP-254-1 will arrive either at the end of the next designated break period, or at the beginning of the following work shift.  SCP-254-1 is an incorporeal human of variable gender, age, race, name, and appearance, able to manipulate objects in the manner similar to that of a normal human of average strength and coordination.  SCP-254-1 will adopt the appearance and persona of a model employee, based on an area’s memetic consensus.  Once SCP-254-1’s appearance has been established, an image of SCP-254-1 that appears to be an 8 x 10 glossy photograph fills the empty picture holder, and it will not change until SCP-254 is moved to a new location.  Across the bottom of the photograph, in print, is the newly assumed name of SCP-254-1.  The photograph cannot be removed from the picture holder by any known means, but it can be torn or ripped.  Doing so in an aggressive or purposeful manner results in a violent reaction from SCP-254-1 (see attached recording SCP-254-a:  [DATA EXPUNGED] the ██/██/████ incident). 

Regardless of appearance, SCP-254-1 maintains a cheerful demeanor at all times.   SCP-254-1 is able to carry on conversations about the weather, traffic, the previous night’s TV shows, sports, and other such topics, although SCP-254-1 will never discuss topics of which present individuals have no knowledge.  Personnel assigned to work in an area where SCP-254 is in use do not appear alarmed by SCP-254-1’s incorporeal nature or sudden appearance, stating that SCP-254-1 “works here.”  Due to local personnel’s reluctance to remove the plaque, or inability to remember to remove the plaque, removal is to be scheduled and performed by off-site personnel.

SCP-254-1 is capable of performing menial tasks quickly and efficiently.  When given tasks that require specialized training, although SCP-254-1 does not possess the required expertise, (s)he will attempt them with the usual good attitude, but will perform as well as an average person could be expected to perform.  SCP-254-1 will continue to perform as exemplary an employee as possible for a length of time between 28-46 work days, usually ending at the conclusion of a calendar month.  If SCP-254 is placed in a workplace several days into a calendar month, SCP-254-1 will act as an effective employee until the end of the following month, although due to the dangers posed by shifting memetic consensus, no use of SCP-254 for longer than 26 days is permitted.  

After the “month” has passed, if SCP-254 is not removed, SCP-254-1 will begin to degrade in performance, beginning with an unhelpful attitude and forgetfulness.  If SCP-254 is not removed, SCP-254-1 will become a worse and worse employee until “fired.”  Firing can be represented by removing SCP-254 from the wall, or by informing SCP-254-1 of its termination.  If SCP-254-1 is fired within approximately 20 days from the start of its decline in performance, SCP-254-1 simply leaves the area and disappears.  Following cessation of employment after this point, SCP-254-1 will actively sabotage the work area in the most destructive manner possible, posing severe hazard to any nearby personnel.  

//And the WORLD, people.  We work with SCPs here, and if proper removal arrangements are not made with off-site security and documented with on-site security, the offending employee will find themselves jobless or worse.  -O5-█//

**Addendum:** Following Incident 254-0210g, all tests on employing SCP-254-1 beyond 26 days must be conducted at a separate site containing no other SCPs.  NO EXCEPTIONS.  -O5-█

**Audio Log 254-a13:**

> Dr. █████: “This is Doctor [REDACTED].    This is experiment #13 on SCP-254.  I am using a standard phillips-head screwdriver, to attempt to remove the brass fitting from SCP-254.”
> 
> [There are 15 seconds of tool-working sounds.]
> 
> “It appears that these screws are affixed by means beyond the normal.  Perhaps glue, or something else.”  
> 
> SCP-251-1 (going by “Gus” this iteration): “Would you like me to get you some solvent, sir?”
> 
> Dr. █████: “No thanks, Gus, no need.  Would you hand me that box cutter?  I’ll try cutting this picture out.”
> 
> Gus: “Really? Why would ya wanna do that? I think that plaque looks jim-dandy right where it is.”
> 
> Dr. █████: “Now now. This isn’t an insult to you, Gus, you’re a great employee.  This is an experiment.”
> 
> Gus: “Okay, Doc, I trust ya.”
> 
> [There is a slight paper ripping noise.]
> 
> Gus: “Whacha doin’ Doc?   Would ya please not do that?”
> 
> Dr. █████: “Just a little bit fur-”
> 
> [The audio of the two cuts out, and there are 5 hard banging sounds - presumably SCP-254-1 slamming Dr. █████'s head against the table.  Then there is a wet sound as the box cutter is [DATA EXPUNGED].]

**Experiment Log 254-b:** Testing on extended employment of SCP-254-1 as a janitor at Sector-██.

> Day 26: End of standard employment period reached.  SCP-254-1’s performance continues to meet high standards.
> 
> Day 32: First sign of performance degradation noted.  SCP-254-1 leaves a dirty rag on Research Assistant █████’s desk.  Apologetic when rag is noticed and returned.
> 
> Day 34: SCP-254-1 is mopping the floor in Sector-███ when a hurrying technician trips over the bucket of cleaning solution.  SCP-254-1 recorded cursing at the technician.
> 
> Day 35: End of the calendar month.  SCP-254-1 described as “sullen” by a late-working researcher.  Break room kitchen in Sector-███ left uncleaned, coffee spilled around Dr. █████’s garbage can.
> 
> Day 36: SCP-254-1 reprimanded by supervisor for apparent drunkenness. (Note: Very odd; SCP-254-1 has never been seen to eat or drink.)
> 
> Day 39: SCP-254-1 fails to return cleaning solutions to the janitorial closet.  Near-disaster when mentally disturbed test subject (see Experiment Log [REDACTED]) finds a bottle of ammonia-based cleaner in a bathroom.  SCP-254-1 reprimanded for carelessness.  Fellow janitor █████ ███████ observed in a verbal altercation with SCP-254-1; both parties are somewhat vague on the cause of the quarrel.
> 
> Day 43: SCP-254-1 again observed to be apparently drunk on duty.  Cleaning is becoming noticeably more erratic.
> 
> Day 48: Fire alarm goes off in Sector-███.  False alarm.  Ink markers fail to pinpoint a culprit, but SCP-254-1 was observed near the tripped alarm a few minutes prior to the incident.  Security footage unavailable due to an unidentifiable object blocking the camera’s view of the hallway.
> 
> Day 56: Dr. ████ upbraids SCP-254-1 for removing perishable items from the lab refrigerator and shredding irreplaceable experiment logs.  SCP-254-1 calls Dr. ████ [REDACTED] and threatens to [REDACTED].  Security called.
> 
> Day 58: Kitchen knife found stabbed deeply into Dr. ████’s whiteboard.  Dr. ████’s locked secure document safe has been opened and rifled.  Guard posted at the door to Dr. ████’s office.  SCP-254-1 and █████ ███████ recorded arguing in raised voices in the staff break room.
> 
> Day 59: Janitor █████ ███████ signs in to work, but fails to report to supervisor.  Located by accident several hours later trapped in the cold storage rooms attached to [REDACTED] autopsy theater, suffering from severe hypothermia.  Guard on duty at Dr. ████’s office incapacitated by a blow to the head; crude human figure formed from a mop head impaled on a broken mop handle driven through Dr. ████’s desk chair.  SCP-254-1 nowhere to be found.
> 
> Day 60: At Dr. ████’s request, and with approval from [DATA EXPUNGED], SCP-254 removed from the wall.  SCP-254-1 leaves the building and vanishes.
> 
> Day 61: SCP-254-1 caught on camera in Sector-███ late at night.  Power failure and multiple backup system failures cause ██ containment breaches, resulting in ██ direct casualties and ██ further losses from sterilization of an outbreak of SCP-███ (see Incident Report 254-0210g).
