[[/div]]


**Item #:** SCP-1403

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** All instances of SCP-1403 are to be contained in a room constructed to contain medium to high levels of radiation, with appropriate shielding in place. All personnel involved with SCP-1403, with the exception of D-class under test conditions, are to wear protective radiation gear at all times.

Each instance of SCP-1403 is to be connected to a standard 9-volt battery, which should be replaced every 2 weeks.

All instances of SCP-1403-B-1 are to be contained in the magnetic containment chamber specifically constructed for their containment (see attached schematics). A backup generator should be on standby to supply the chamber with power in the event of an outage.

**Description:** Instances of SCP-1403 include --thirty one--[[footnote]] One was transformed into an instance of SCP-1403-B-1 during testing. [[/footnote]] thirty light bulbs of non-standard design. The base of each is of the double-contact bayonet design, yet lack a filament. Inside the bulb of each object is approximately 118mL of water, and one creature resembling a common goldfish. These entities do not eat or defecate, subsisting solely on electricity. The bulbs themselves are designated instances of SCP-1403-A, and the fish instances of SCP-1403-B.

The creatures can be removed from the bulbs by dismantling the bulb, however they will not live longer than 5 days outside their bulb, even while supplied with electricity. Dissections have revealed that the creatures are not common goldfish, though they share 96% identical DNA. They possess no digestive tract, and in its place is an organ that is theorized to be responsible for converting electricity into sustenance for the creature. It is probable that they were genetically engineered.

Replacing an instance of SCP-1403-B with a common goldfish yields no anomalous results. 

An instance of SCP-1403-B will function nearly the same inside a modified non-anomalous bulb as when contained in an anomalous bulb, however the water must contain a small concentration of salt or a similar mineral to facilitate the electrical current's flow. The water contained in the anomalous light bulbs is nearly pure water. It appears that the objects lower the electrical resistance of the water by an unknown means.

Whenever an instance of SCP-1403-A is connected to electrical current through the two pins on its side, the object manifests its anomalous properties. The instance of SCP-1403-B within will glow with an orange bio-luminescence. When the electrical current reaches greater than 70 amps, the creature begin emitting gamma radiation as well as visible light. The strength of this radiation is directly proportional to the amplitude of the electrical current, reaching levels harmful to humans at around 200 amps. 

At 100 amps, the fish begin to emit an unknown form of radiation similar to that emitted by SCP-████. No connection is theorized at this time.

At 200 amps, the radiation is strong enough to kill a human after 30 minutes of continuous exposure. The creature’s glow is sufficiently bright at this time to blind anyone without protective eye-wear.

At 400 amps, the creature undergoes a transformation. It will emit an intensely bright flash of light, exceeding 140,000 lux, and an accompanying burst of gamma and Cherenkov radiation. The creature then converts most its body into thermal energy, electrical energy, and radiation. How this conversion is accomplished is unknown. In this state, the creature is designated as an instance of SCP-1403-B-1. The SCP still retains the same shape, but possess the ability to levitate. Spectral analysis of instances of SCP-1403-B-1 have revealed their internal structure to be composed of little more than a loose cloud of electrons, which maintain the creature's shape. Electrical and thermal energy is contained within this electron cloud by an unknown means. The radiation manifests as a blue glow of visible light and a small amount of gamma radiation. While an instance of SCP-1403-B-1 is surrounded by air, the air within its electron cloud will become a plasma in a manner similar to lightning.

Instances of SCP-1403-B-1 can pass through solid matter without any kind of resistance. Their passing through an object in this manner causes the object to become very hot, heating it to an average of 260 degrees centigrade. The Foundation is currently in possession of --eight-- seven instances of SCP-1403-B-1, though --three-- four more are estimated to still exist outside containment[[footnote]] See Incident Report 1403-A-1 [[/footnote]]. It is unknown how long the creatures can survive in this state, but specimens have been in containment for ██ years and show no signs of deteriorating. 


**Addendum:**

**-Recovery Log 1403:** SCP-1403 was initially discovered during a Foundation raid on █████ Pet Store in ██████, TX, on ████████ ██, 19██. None of the store's records made reference to any products fitting the description of SCP-1403. The shop had 10 instances of SCP-1403 on display connected to a standard electrical outlet. A sudden power surge caused all 10 of the creatures to enter their energy state. 6 serious injuries and 3 fatalities resulted from the raid. Though 7 instances of SCP-1403-B-1 were recovered, 3 have not yet been located.

**-Incident Report 1403-A-1:** Following a containment breach of SCP-████, the SCP-1403-B-1 magnetic containment chamber was critically damaged, allowing for the escape of all 7 instances of SCP-1403-B-1. All but one were re-contained. The seventh was observed descending through the floor of the facility, and has not yet resurfaced. Unique radiation signatures resembling that of the creature have been recorded from just below the Earth's crust, in the upper layers of the mantle. It is theorized that the other 3 un-contained instances of SCP-1403-B-1 also reside in the mantle. Methods of capture and containment are under review.
