[[collapsible show=".                    " hide="COMMENTARY"]]
[[[SCP-2829]]] was my very first skip. I avoided the 'Failed First Skip' curse by just being too nervous to post, mostly, but I got a ton of feedback and all that. It was also how I learned about the Adipose from Dr. Who, incidentally. 

The original concept was basically little balls of fat that make you happy but something BAD happens. I was inspired by 999 when making this, because as much as I love the concept, that article //sucks//. 999 is happiness personified. What's the opposite of happiness? Maybe sadness and loss. Sometimes I like the Greek tragedy kind of irony. So I decided, hey, reimagine 999. Juxtapose sadness with happiness. Zyn told me to think of a story for these things, so I did. 2829 is the story of something made to bring joy, yet only succeeding in bringing more sadness into the world. The slugs suffer because they're starving and they can't fulfill their purpose. The Foundation staff suffer to keep it as safely contained as possible. Dr. Blackbox suffers because they ate him and their intended recipient never gets them.

Why slugs? Your guess is as good as mine. I don't even particularly //like// slugs. I'm far too proud of the title than I have any right to be.

Inspiration: [[[SCP-999]]] (duh), [[[SCP-1293]]]

[[[SCP-3031]]]. If it wasn't for the contest, I don't think this would ever exist. Honestly, the whole thing was born out of a narcissistic desire to get myself into history through the contest. I figured if I tried and didn't quite //fail//, that would still be a pretty good outcome. --This is the quickest I have ever (and likely will ever) pushed something from concept to draft to posted, less than two and a half weeks.-- //haha suck it, past me//

Now, on to the skip itself. I knew I had no chance in hell of winning the contest. So I went full meta --alchemist-- and decided to write my thing on fear itself. I figured that a contest would be the only time I'd get away with something so ambitious. Parasites freak me out. The idea of something in your head that is eating your thoughts and replacing them with its own freaks me out. I knew it wouldn't be horror-y enough to win, but it seems to have done well. I like timeline-screwing in general. Yes, the iterations and note are cliche. But I like those cliches, and I think they're rather cool still.

[[[SCP-3233]]] is a special skip for me, because it's A) the first skip idea I made completely wholecloth, and B) the first time I had to pull and revise something. It's the first time I actually experienced the whole "look at things in your everyday life that inspire you" method of idea coming-up-with. Anyways, long story short I was talking to a friend who works with animals, and she mentioned that for whatever reason, the animals seemed to only give birth when she was around. I never found out if this was just confirmation bias, but the idea of a person affecting animals in that way interested me. This was the same friend who told me about the existence of tenrecs; they're pretty cool animals. And since they got no representation on this site, and we need more animals that aren't cats, dogs, or birds, I figured why not.

The idea was stuck with me for a while, but last New Years Eve I had the urge to pull out my phone and write a quick rough draft on that useless Memos app. I have this thing where I'll write a bunch, then stop cold, then edit a tiny thing a month later. I'm still shy about asking for feedback, so it ends up being a continuous, slow cycle of improvements before I can even think it's good enough to ask someone to check it.

Anyway, I finally got it the way I liked it, and then ended up self-deleting a few days later. I received valuable feedback that it was organized //horribly//, and people were divided on the silly ending. The contest, and working on 3031 got in the way after I made minimal progress. I got back to it, and while writing it it sort of got away from me. I decided to amputate the ending from the skip itself, and I'll probably put it into a companion tale instead (//6 months and counting, and nothing//). I'm happy with how it's developed, though.

[[[SCP-3435]]] is probably my favorite thing I've written, tied with the slugs because they're sentimental to me. Anyway. I think the roots of this started when I read a skip (can't remember which) and someone had gone off on a tangent about how the skip was actually metaphorical for something completely unrelated, like a high school lit class. Combine that with an unwanted burst of politics in 19 one day, and my frustration led to me typing "skip idea: painting what punishes people who interpret it politically" (note: this isn't the exact quote, but no way in hell I'm digging through my mountain of chat logs for this right now).

Originally I just meant that line as a joke. Another user asked if they could use it, and that's when I selfishly realized I could have a lot of fun writing it up. It started out as a veiled rant against that sort of people. It became so much more. 

The Ds were tough. They're people too, with childhoods and dreams just like anyone else. A lot of their dream parts are from dreams I've had over the years. I took inspiration from Zyn's Feels Bowl when I worked on that part.

I think the soul of this one was the interview between Gutierrez and Palanez. The anartist and the Foundation doctor. Two sides of the same coin. This was simultaneously the easiest and hardest part to write. I like the idea of a Fox and the Hound type deal in the Foundation. Two people, still connected despite being on different sides of the fence. The goal was to show that even though they are diametrically opposed, they are more similar than anyone would think. I believe that there's an alternate reality where Gutierrez is the one in the lab coat asking questions. 

The effect is still there, but I think of this as more praising and less bashing. This site is an escape for me, much as Gutierrez finds an escape in his art. I read about the impossible here. The world of the Foundationverse is not the one I live in, and I like it that way. I do think over-analysis is dumb, though. Sometimes blue curtains are just blue. I enjoy movies like Pacific Rim.

All in all, this was probably the most meta, author-mouthpiece skip I'll ever write here. I wrote exactly what I already think; Gutierrez is me. Gutierrez is several of my friends over the years. Gutierrez is several of my acquaintances here. I'm sure there's a little bit of him in you too. Gutierrez is everything I thought I wanted to be when I was young. He's my childhood personified. He's the manifestation of the crayon drawings that hung on our fridge. He's the kid that played imaginary games with his friends and pretended to be superheroes or knights. 

Story is nice, characters are nice, emotions are nice, worldbuilding is nice, but I came to this wiki for cool stuff and I've stayed for the cool stuff. Crystals that change you into quartz. World-destroyers in Jupiter. Cognitohazardous kidneys. And when the sun swells to a red giant and the solar flares finally kill the internet and this site, then the question "Are We Cool Yet" can finally be answered with a resounding YES.

[[[SCP-3637]]] was something of an self-imposed challenge. If you go in order, my articles steadily get longer. This one clocks in at under 500 words according to Word, making it less than half the size of the next shortest. At the time of writing, this is the only one of my articles that doesn't involve people at all. There's no interview logs. There's no mysterious notes or logs left behind. There's no doctors bickering in the footnotes. Not a single person is mentioned by name here, and yet to me this one has the most emotion of any of my works. Sometimes simplicity is nice.

Let's see. I started out by noticing that for a partially-sci-fi site, we don't have that many dinosaurs, compared to say, cats, dogs, or other common animals. Dinosaurs are cool. Anyway, I wanted to do something involving a crystal dinosaur reanimating from the ground and being washed away by the rain over and over again. That was the core; no matter what, we gotta have a cycling crystal dino. (It was only after posting that I remembered that [[[SCP-250]]] was a thing.)

HammerMaiden majorly helped me out early on, and without that help it would have been some super dumb story that made no sense. Anyways, the concept of 'unfinished business' applying to a dinosaur mind, to paraphrase what FFB said, interested me. So what narrative would carry the concept? Motherly love and anguish sounded pretty good to me.

//Maiasaura// is one of the slightly more famous dinosaurs, but well known for the wealth of knowledge we have about its caretaking nature. It took good care of its little eggies. It's made of salt for two reasons, one being that there is actually a lot of salt out there, and two being that salt can represent tears and preservation if you're one of those people inclined to look for symbolism. I felt that the futility of the mother dinosaur endlessly walking, searching for long-dead eggs that aren't even nearby, was enhanced by the fact that she keeps coming back to life only to inevitably dissolve in the rain. Never-ending cycle, desperate even as she dissolves that maybe this time, //this time// she'll find her precious eggs.

From the start I wanted to write a Neutralized skip, and this was the perfect opportunity to do it. In breaking the loop, I wanted to add here that for once, the Foundation accidentally did something really nice, as compared to all the times they accidentally make things worse. 

Inspiration: [[[SCP-1731]]], [[[SCP-2091]]], [[[SCP-1281]]]

Also, the Easter egg for those who are curious: 

The date of the last Ramah event is 5/13/18, Mother's Day (at least in the US).

You know what, I've got more to say about this. I upvote all kinds of different stuff on the site. However, 3637 is close to the core of what //I// personally see as the quintessential SCP. I love it, not just because I wrote it, but because it has everything I like in an SCP (funny how that works):

* It's short. Long stuff can be nice, but sometimes you just want that sweet little morsel.
* It's understandable. No technical descriptions, no incomprehensible hard science. The only italicized term is '//Maiasaura//' and you get a picture so you don't have to Google the dinosaur.
* It can stand alone perfectly. No need for any prior or side reading, no deep and invested mythos.
* It makes no sense. How the hell does a dinosaur get fossilized into a salt ghost?
* It makes perfect sense. Everything is internally consistent. You understand exactly what the ghost wants and what happens when it gets it.
* 4 and 5 coexist in the same SCP.
* It's weird. This is the biggest one, for me.

Right, almost forgot to do one of these for [[[SCP-3839]]]. 

This one was tough to write, because I had a lot of pieces and not a lot of ideas on how to connect them all. A lot of fat got trimmed and left on the cutting room floor. Let me just, say, it's going to be a very long time before I try to write something interconnected again. 

I am very proud of how well I concealed my lack of knowledge on the subjects involved through Wikipedia binging, so much so that at least one person asked about my nonexistent degree. 

Not much to say about this one that hasn't already been said. I'm not 100% pleased with it but I don't have the time or effort to polish it more; at a certain point you just get tired of your draft and want to puke it up. 
----
Oh god, the damn [[[grant-request-for-a-replacement-keyboard-because-the-caps-lo|GRANT REQUEST]]]. --At the moment, this shitpost has beaten all of my other works on the site--. I'm still working on how to feel about that.

Anyway, I do like Prometheus Labs. As a nerdy STEM undergrad, I consider them among my favorite GoIs here, but the titles of their formats, man. Linking one in chat pulls up this massive block of ALL CAPS. I've made idle jokes about "GRANT REQUEST TO FIX CAPS LOCK" and such a few times, and around May I started building up the number of in-progress tabs on my sandbox, so I decided to just make an empty tab titled "GRANT REQUEST FOR A REPLACEMENT KEYBOARD BECAUSE THE CAPS LOCK ON THIS ONE IS BROKEN" as a joke; just to put a smile on the face of whoever's critting one of my drafts or something.

A little while ago I figured, 'do we have any joke GoI formats?' Depends; you may or may not consider shaggydredlocks' [[[prantortiz-the-vile| black queen format]]] the first. I decided to turn that joke tab into a full blown joke format.

I wrote the first two sections, then left it alone for a while. I decided early on I was gonna coldpost this sucker; and see if it lived or died. I came up with the escalation that morning, and added some more stuff to it. //While editing the new page// I added maybe a fourth of what's currently there. I finished it up, posted, and honestly thought it would either hang low or get downvoted.

Wasn't the first time I was wrong.
----
//why do i keep forgetting to update these//

I made [[[SCP-3132]]] as a direct result of the [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-1815424#post-2750860 |Ideas That Would Never Work thread]]], and an agreement with [[*user TomatointheMirror]]. I //love// (to a probably anomalous degree) cracking my back, to the point where just hearing the sound of someone else doing it gives me placebo-esque relief, and from there I had my core anomaly. I wanted to capture the old feel of anomalies being plain unpredictable, defying anything close to a 'grand unified theory'. Probably didn't work as well as I had hoped, but ehh. 
----
Nothing much more to say about the inspiration process for [[[SCP-3536]]] beyond what I put in the author post. 

This one's had a bit of a troubled production (even for me). I had the core of it drafted up by December, then was politely informed by the wonderful DrBleep that my science was absolutely, hilariously wrong. I couldn't be bothered to deal with it at that time, and left the planned journal entries half finished.

Yeah, there were supposed to be a bunch of journal entries (woo cliche) and stuff detailing the group's descent into delicious, cytoplasm-y madness. A lot of RL Bad Stuff^^TM^^ and frustration later, and I finally decided 'screw it'. I took an ax to the draft, hacked away all of the unnecessary crap, and wiped off the blood. Then I posted it lukewarm.

It's definitely not perfect, but I'm very happy with it. --It's now my new shortest SCP article-- (wow that didn't last long), and it manages to skim by without all that fluff that you see so often. I should do more skips like this one (8 months later, no sign of stopping).
----
[[[SCP-049-D]]]. Right then. I saw that Day 1 of JamCon2018 had the prompt "Murder Mystery" and promptly quit. On the way home, I conceived a gag tale around the death of a major skip. And who's everyone's favorite punching bag? Yup. He even came with the perfect culprit, kaktus' excellent joke version.

Stayed up till about 1:30 am writing it, showed it to the first person I could wrangle to make sure it was funny to someone else besides me, and then posted it, self-upvoted, and went to sleep.

I'm happy with it. I never would have expected something like this to be my first posted tale but that's just how the cookie crumbles.
----
First things first: [[[SCP-3759]]] is my //new// shortest skip at the time of writing, nearly exactly half the size of the previous title-holder, [[[SCP-3536]]]. So I'll keep this short. 3759 actually started out with moas (the extinct flightless bird) as the base, having a splinter group of them create their own moving island of safety by walking straight out of New Zealand. I then decided that tortoises > moas, and was able to remember the neat tidbit of Lonesome George's existence. I could still have my extinction haven, but I decided to make them ghosts. An earlier idea was that the entire island of tortoises would vanish when George finally joined them, as if they were waiting for the last one so they could finally pass on, but I rejected that as being both too sad and too similar to the story beats of [[[SCP-3637]]].

"Terminarch" is a less-frequently used alternate to the scientific word "endling", meaning "an individual that is the last of its species", like the late George. I chose it because it sounds far more dignified and majestic compared to 'endling' which can only bring the term 'youngling' from Star Wars to mind.
----
[[[Ramah]]]. I had once promised myself I would never write anything else about 3637, but after flailing around trying to figure out what to write for Day 3, it came to me. Stormy = lightning + rain. 3637 had both of those. Once again, I stayed up till 2 am, got someone to make sure it didn't suck, and posted. I wanted it very surreal and abstract, and short. I think I nailed that, not sure. Never wrote prose like that before.
----
[[[SCP-3789]]] stemmed from a miscommunication about [[[SCP-3759]]]. Someone thought the turtles were //made// of volcanic rock, which led to the realization that a volcano rock turtle would also be pretty cool. So, in my endless quest for coolness escalation, I swapped sedentary tortoises with //Archelon//, the prehistoric mega turtle. I remembered [[[SPC-3284-J]]] being a thing (but not [[[SCP-788]]], at the time) and figured the article would work better with the magma turtle appearing as the stinger to something else. Turtles eat jellyfish. Balancing the jellyfish itself between 'exactly like a regular jellyfish' and 'too alien' was tricky, but I think I did OK. The end took a little touching up. A couple people didn't think the turtle reveal was enough, so in the end I settled for a shark tooth stuck in the turtle shell to imply a larger ecosystem and the existence of titanic lava sharks.

Overall, I'm very very happy with this one. I had realized that my 2 previous animal SCPs, 3637 and 3759, both had similar themes of death/afterlife, as well as the larger umbrella of 'sad'. I wanted to be sure I could pull off an animal skip without using emotion as a crutch, and I think I succeeded. [[[SCP-3789]]] is my love letter to Series 1: simple, cool anomaly, with very subtle implications, and not much else, because nothing else is necessary. The fact that it's been received fairly well makes me hopeful for the site as a whole.

----
[[[SCP-3379]]] is my first collab, with DarkStuff. Not much else to say that wasn't said in the author post.

Also my longest skip. This is one of those "screw everyone, I do it my way" deals. D-11424 made his first appearance in [[[SCP-3435]]], for those of you who care.
----
[[[SCP-3467]]]: I don't know why I picked a moa. I just like that bird. Also this is technically the 4th skip of mine involving extinct animals? Weird. 

WWS is a fun GOI. It's official now thanks to this SCP.

This is also the first time I use my own pet MTF, Phi-2 ("Clever Girls"), in an SCP. Rest assured their next adventure will end in a slightly more dignified way.

I tried making a log for this, but it didn't work as well as the short version I ended up going with.

----
[[[SCP-3528]]] had probably one of the shortest and weirdest concept cycles outside of jam contest stuff.

OK, so I was at the gym, and I thought idly of [[[SCP-2283]]] and its name, "Spirit Bomb". And I figured, hey, I can make anime references too, right? So I paused for about 2 minutes and remembered Soul Eater, and 'Witch Hunter'. 

OK, what kind of witches? Wait a second. I vaguely remember reading something about a squad in WW2 called the 'Night Witches'. 

OK, what's hunting them? Something that flies... at night... bats. Bats could work.

From that point on it pretty much wrote itself. I struggled against revealing too much, and changed the specific powers of the bat once, but aside from that it went pretty smoothly. I like how it turned out.

----
[[[SCP-3949]]] has been a rollercoaster. I decided I wanted to write a skip where the containment procedures were literally "pick on someone on Tumblr". I went to sleep, and woke up with the idea of a possibly nonexistent show. DarkStuff helped me figure out the main anomaly, for which I am very grateful. After that I knocked out a draft in about 3 or 4 hours, and got it polished. 

I'm very proud of the ending line. And I'm also thankful that I got some great feedback to make that line the very end of the skip (it was originally followed by a short addendum). I find it really amusing that a sizable number of people found it "funny" instead of sad.

This skip has no meta relation to the SCP community. It is very loosely based on a fandom I briefly interacted with, but I'll die before I say which one.

//Penumbra W.A.V.E.// is about a colony of humans living on a planet with several moons. Special crystals growing on the surfaces of these moons refract light to the planet and imbue it with magic power. Warriors wield this power and defend the kingdom of Mykaris against various threats, including ice dinosaurs and lightning golems. 

It's supposed to be ambiguous whether //Penumbra W.A.V.E.// actually exists in our world, or if 3949 is just lost dimensionally. Not sure how that played out. 

----
Ah, [[[SCP-3589]]]. This one actually started up as a superhero I had come up with a ways back. I figured I was never actually gonna do anything concrete with him so I made some changes (main one being that he can't control which arm will appear), skippified him, and prepared for the tomatoes.

I hadn't done a humanoid in a whole year since the uh, middling performance of 3233. True to my personal vendetta, I deliberately avoided any interviews or dialogue from the skip.

I actually don't know what happened to poor Dr. Marquez. Her older sister did //not// take it well when she found out, though.

Armando returns in the blockbuster summer hit that is [[[apotheosis-hub|APOTHEOSIS]]] so be sure to check that out.

----
[[[a farewell to arms]]]. In spite of all the careful planning, it took an embarrassingly long time to figure out what I was gonna do for my required Doomsday contest submission.

Fieldstone pulled through with a cool addition to the timeline in early drafts of 3731, and I ran with it. I decided it couldn't hurt to show a 3396!skip mutation, and I had promised [[*user CadaverCommander]] that [[[SCP-3589]]]'s scrapped neutron star arm would return, so I killed 2 birds with one stone and made him the protag.

I had a //ton// of fun writing this, and coming up with the suit weapons and mutant descriptions. I channeled fieldstone's Parts and Olympus tales, as well as a dash of Hypervelocity, and 100 cc of CC extract into my veins, and here we are.

----
Oh, [[[SCP-1701]]]. I saw an EZ-UP at church shed its sandbag and fly around the courtyard, flip over, and waggle its legs aggressively and I //knew// I had to make it a skip. Nothing much about this one; wanted to see if you could still get by with a 'classic monster' skip, looks like you still can. Rushed to post this one quick enough to snatch a vacated von pincier slot, succeeded. I will say that the incineration line is an intentional nod to the classic D&D gazebo story. Been meaning to take a pic of the real life inspiration gazebo and replace the pic, one of these days.
----
[[[SCP-1565]]], yeeeesh. As it turns out, my rush to snatch a s2 slot was entirely pointless... I had always liked this one while disliking the execution, and the last time I remembered looking at it it was at +3 or +4. By chance I noticed the second vote on the deletion timer ticking down with one hour left and rushed to claim rewrite. 

I wanted to keep the mystery of the original while maintaining the same coolness and inexplicability the original had. I think I succeeded, but due to me posting at butt in the night and failing to promote it whatsoever it's hovering in the 20s for the foreseeable future, oh well. I saved it, and that's what counts.

----
[[[SCP-4041]]] is a weird blend of me and not-me. I had the idea for this one ever since JamCon. I looked at M_E's [[[SCP-3940]]] and figured, hey, what if the same thing, but dinosaurs didn't like being related to birds? I brainstormed possibilities for it with Hippo, but couldn't figure out how to crystallize it and shelved it.

Then came the contest. I was completely blindsided by "history"; I was expecting 'fantasy' or 'romance' or anything else. History is mega boring so I had nothing but to dig through my dinosaur drafts and see which would be the most suitable. After a long battle between this one, [GENESIS FURNACE](soon to be posted) and [SECRET PROJECT DW](hahaha keep dreaming), including a point where I seriously considered merging the latter two, I figured out a gimmick (the bird ritual) that gave me a jumping off point to write the ghost dinosaurs. 

The interview was the toughest part. I was originally against it, but the article was too short and I //knew// some people wouldn't get it without one. Hippo was a great help paring and shaping the interview, since I almost never do those, and I'm very satisfied with pulling off such a ballsy concept.

Additionally, I can now crosslink this one and get away with all my future dino skips lacking feathers. Because feathers on dinosaurs looks //**fucking stupid.**//
----
The goddamn [[[weryllium-proposal|Proposal]]]. While working on-and-off (mostly off) on my 4k I procrastinated so hard I ended up making a good 5 or 6 other drafts. This was one of them; a realization that no one had made the joke on the double meaning of '001 proposal' before, so I could do it.

I banged it out in roughly two (nonconsecutive) days, one day to write the original, had it critted by Magnus who suggested some very helpful restructuring, and one day to bring the version you see now.

----
[[[SCP-4243]]] is a return to form, and a marriage of my older biological works to my refined hyper condensed style. I had a tab in the ol' pile labeled simply 'homework town' with a single chat line in it (from a gib, I think), and could never get around to writing it. One day it just came to me and I banged it out in a few days. It's a little stunted by the massive flood of s5 opening posts but whatever. 
----
[[[Alchemic Arm-istice]]] continues the streak of only writing tales for contests. I was pretty apprehensive about joining the [[[scp-oct-hub|Original Character Contest]]] but I decided 'what the hell' and jumped in with my favorite person-y creation. Ruslav Diaghilev is fun to use, and I got to do some tricks I didn't think of when making Farewell to Arms. Will update when the sequel is out.

[[[SCP-4142]]] started as merely the words "sun raptor" that wouldn't leave my head. Originally they were just made of solar plasma, but then I found [[[SCP-334]]] and had to differentiate. I think mine is cooler (utahraptor vs fox? come on) but I'm probably biased.

It's currently one of the 'purest' things I have, in terms of sheer weryllium-ness. Count with me: 
# dinosaur
# really cool stuff (stars and supernovas)
# unique concept
# no people in it 
# doesn't use emotion or narrative as a crutch 
# pretty short
# makes sense, but also makes no sense
I wish I could write everything the way I did this one. Also: this one took the most wikipedia'ing of pretty much anything I've done, even 3839.
----
[[[SCP-4344]]] is the corollary to 4142, because it's just rule of cool with enough 'story' snuck in to make it float. In planning [SECRET PROJECT] I needed to do something with the Chicxulub asteroid. Originally I was gonna have dinosaurs mine it for iridium, but Hippo suggested 'asteroid spaceship' and I just ran with it. 

----
I got the inspiration for [[[SCP-4546]]] while watching the 4th of July fireworks, because I'm a GODDAMN AMERICAN. Figured out an angle, sat on it for a while as I worked on other stuff. It's not my //favorite// thing but it works ok.

----
Not sure where [[[SCP-4647]]] came from. I remember driving down an empty highway late at night and just seeing this big ol truck coming up behind me and tried to skippify that. DarkStuff and Kirby helped me figure out what ending to give it (I went through like, 6) and I pushed it out. Surprisingly hard to find a non-city road pic. 

----
[[[SCP-4748]]] is one of my more favored children because it's yet another "weird creature" skip and I managed to keep it pretty pure along the process without adding bullshit I didn't like. I'm glad the formula can still work today. Gives me hope for the site's future and for my own future as a skip author.

----
[[[SCP-4849]]] is weird. I really wanted 4849 to be the 3rd in the series but come the opening of series 5 I had absolutely no ideas for it. I was at the gym and suddenly the idea just pops in my head "hey what if it was a suit" and I just rolled with it. Rounderhouse spent a good month bugging me to write it after I infected him with hype. Figuring out how to write out the log was the hardest and most time consuming part but I think it worked OK, and it feels good to know I can still gross people out if I need to. I have no idea what I'm gonna do if and when I ever continue this bizarre "series".
----
I'm incredibly proud of [[[SCP-3794]]]. For the longest time I realized that I never wrote an SCP that could, as my brain put it, "be grabbed at random and used to beat someone over the head". I remembered what tvtropes dubbed the "Chunky Salsa Rule" and whipped this up in like 2 days. Got the bare minimum of crits, shaved off some extra words, and posted. I think it dipped as low as -3 or -4 before it started picking up again. 

If I'm not mistaken, this beats out the paper crane SCP (as well as my previous attempt to beat that, the former 3597) and once again gives me the shortest SCP in series 4 (//182 words// according to word counter). 
----
[[[SCP-4479]]] is my 2nd ever collab, with [[*user Captain Kirby]]. When the contest was announced I suggested teaming up with him, because of how diametrically opposite our styles and approaches are, and he agreed on the condition that none of the cliches he had specifically prepared for were used in the contest. They weren't, so we got to work.

This is essentially a repeat of the 3379 process, where I did most of the description, then we tossed things back and forth and wrote the log in chunks. It also once again features the wiki's favorite D-class getting lost in weird places so I figured it was fitting to number it 4479 after his first starring role.
----
[[[SCP-4729]]], another strong contender for "least weryllium but also definitely weryllium" skip.

I was driving home in traffic and listening to [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olmmiOUQnVM this song] on loop the whole way through and 15 minutes in I just got the idea to write a skip based on it. I conceived the entire idea while driving and then just cranked it out the night I got home. Got some crit, polished it up, and let it fly. It's a really weird one for me because it's really emotional and raw and I relate to it harder than I should, which is a definite sign someone needs to get over here and exorcise me. 
----
[[[SCP-4119]]] is a return to roots and a departure from them at the same time, again. I wanted to break tradition and make a literal superhero character. "Miss Dynamite" is the English translation of the title of a //novela// that I binge watched last fall and it just stuck in my head and I wanted to write a skip with that title. A lot of sciency Wikipedia-ing later and this was the result. 

----
[[[SCP-3689]]] is a pretty standard skip. The original sandwich was inspired by my brother and some weird school project he had to do and I helped him with, ages ago. Inspired by Regular Show and Dinosaur Comics, I liked the idea of a highly sought after Ultimate Sandwich, and abandoned the original idea of it having Every Meat. 

The pirate bit, I think came from having drawn the original school project sandwich with a pirate sword stuck through it instead of a toothpick or whatever.  
----
[[[SCP-3584]]] is thanks to Meserach and her skip prompt generator. She gave me the prompt, I sat on it for months, finally threw it out. I fucked up the release of this one and that's //probably// why it's kinda low but whatever. It's cool and I'm happy with it. Fucking dandelions, goddamn weeds
----
[[[SCP-3749]]] is one of my oldest skip ideas. Probably almost as old as tenrec goddess, idk. Too lazy to check the sandbox revisions. I finally figured out how to do it, and make fun of edgy 'humanity must die' people.
----
[[[SCP-3753]]] was really fun to write. I had the idea when driving home, and knocked it out quick (heh). I think my brother at one point mentioned the idea of his immune system literally punching the disease and then I went from there. 

Ursula Nunez is still one of my favorite people. She'll be back. 
----
[[[SCP-3659]]] is pretty neat. I came up with it in one morning. Remember the old disney movie //Dinosaur//? I had a hand puppet of the Carnotaurus as a kid. Dunno where it went, but I miss it.
----
[[[SCP-3683]]] was fun. Pigeons have been the bane of my family's existence. A person IRL said the phrase "dire pigeons" and I just had to use it.
----
[[[SCP-3829]]]... my bastard child. The team loved it. Which is all that matters because the three of us and Flops are the only ones who still care so //shrug//. More than one way to write immortals.

Maybe I'll write more of these, points be damned. Not like anyone else will.
----
[[[SCP-3734]]] was fun. I barely even remember watching Power Rangers.
