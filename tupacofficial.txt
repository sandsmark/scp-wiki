**SCPs**

//"We're so sorry."//
[[collapsible show="+ Author Commentary" hide="- Hide"]]
This was my first SCP, conceived on a road trip to NoCal, December 2018. I distinctly remember planning out the first draft in the parking lot of a Home Depot in LA on the way home. 

In hindsight, I would have probably done something a little more ambitious with the concept. I was lucky enough to strike gold with my first idea, and there are many ways I can play it.

I'm not entirely sure how I feel about this one. On one hand, I think I achieved the minimalist existential horror (a type of horror I seem quite fond of) angle very well. On the other hand, the core concept behind it is one that is very much at odds with many accepted canons in the Foundation universe, and with my own beliefs as well.

A bad Jamcon entry about a bad pun.

//"This can't be all there is."//
[[collapsible show="+ Author Commentary" hide="- Hide"]]
This was honestly painful to write. 

Not because it's that //bad// or anything, but because the circumstances surrounding its creation are so shitty. The week of Jamcon 2019 was a rough one. I was sick for most of it, I had three tests and a lot of homework at school, and, of course, it was Jamcon. On top of that I ended up cycling through three different drafts of this one, one of which I almost took to its conclusion, before scrapping it entirely. So I pushed this thing out of my ass over the course of the five hours leading up to the contest deadline. The end product is... of debatable quality.

Also, it's a 3614 tale, so yeah.
