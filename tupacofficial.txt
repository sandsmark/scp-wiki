This was my first SCP, conceived on a road trip to NoCal, December 2018. I distinctly remember planning out the first draft in the parking lot of a Home Depot in LA on the way home. 

In hindsight, I would have probably done something a little more ambitious with the concept. I was lucky enough to strike gold with my first idea, and there are many ways I can play it.

I'm not entirely sure how I feel about this one. On one hand, I think I achieved the minimalist existential horror (a type of horror I seem quite fond of) angle very well. On the other hand, the core concept behind it is one that is very much at odds with many accepted canons in the Foundation universe, and with my own beliefs as well.

A bad Jamcon entry about a bad pun.

//"As of 2051-04-22, 189 out of 193 members of the United Nations have ratified the Moscow Accords."//

Very proud of how this turned out. First article I managed to get to publication in a couple of months. Part of the horror comes from the fact that the underlying threat depicted, while not necessarily mutant animals out for blood, is something we are dealing with right now.

Fun fact: Most of the syntax of the Moscow accords was derived from a certain real-life UN agreement on climate change in a certain French city that a certain country is going to pull out of in 2020.

This was honestly painful to write. 

Not because it's that //bad// or anything, but because the circumstances surrounding its creation are so shitty. The week of Jamcon 2019 was a rough one. I was sick for most of it, I had three tests and a lot of homework at school, and, of course, it was Jamcon. On top of that I ended up cycling through three differen t drafts of this one, one of which I almost took to its conclusion, before scrapping it entirely. So I pushed this thing out of my ass over the course of the five hours leading up to the contest deadline. The end product is... of debatable quality.

Crossliked with 3614.
