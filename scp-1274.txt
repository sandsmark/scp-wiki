**Item #:** SCP-1274

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** News media and Internet video sites are to be scanned continually for any of the keywords found in Addendum SCP-1274-1. Internet videos should be suppressed by DMCA takedown requests from an appropriate Foundation front corporation. News reports should be investigated under the pretense of an outbreak of a dangerous strain of influenza.

Any instances of SCP-1274-1 discovered in the course of an investigation are to be contained in individual windowless cells. Food and hygiene facilities are to be provided. Any entertainment media without music may be provided at the discretion of the head researcher. Any interviews with SCP-1274 instances are to take place with the subject physically restrained to prevent movement of the arms and legs.

**Description:** SCP-1274 is a proprioceptive memetic hazard in the form of a novel style of dance, which shows influences from various Caribbean dance styles and the American urban form known as “krumping”. The dance is performed in groups in a “follow the leader” fashion, with one dancer performing a series of moves which are then emulated by the rest of the dancers. The style is improvisational in some respects, but has a core repertoire of ██ distinct movements which appear repeatedly. A specific sequence of ██ of these movements appears to be the contagious agent.

SCP-1274 is safe to observe, live or by video. Transmission only occurs when the key sequence of movements is performed by a subject (hereafter known as SCP-1274-1). Short-term effects include euphoria and a feeling of harmony with other dancers. Additionally, instances of SCP-1274-1 display the following cognitive changes:

* Increased sexual receptiveness.
* Increased suggestibility.
* Preference for consensus-based conflict resolution.
* Reduced need for sleep (varies by individual, but some instances have shown no ill effects from two hours of sleep nightly)
* A marked preference for the color orange.

SCP-1274 was first discovered in [REDACTED], a medium-sized American city with a significant minority population of Dominican descent. (However, no evidence of contagion has been discovered in the Dominican Republic itself.) Agents contained ██ SCP-1274-1 instances in a raid on a “warehouse party” following a tip from a local observer. Since then, █ additional outbreaks have occurred, primarily in cities of population 300,000 or less in the Southeastern United States. Additionally, three instances of instructional videos for the dance have been discovered on YouTube. While these have been successfully repressed by Foundation action, the number of individuals exposed to them is unknown.
