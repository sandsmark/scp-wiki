+ How do I bold?

You can easily format text by highlighting it and clicking one of the buttons at the top of the edit box.  This will add the proper syntax that will bold, underline, headline text when the page is saved.

+ How do I add a picture?

First go the the bottom of the page and click the word 'files.'  This will allow you to upload an image to the wiki.  (note: you can give the pic any name you want, but make sure there are no spaces and it ends with a description, such as '.jpg').  Once the file is added, you can view the file by clicking the name of it at the bottom of the page.  There you will find the url that hosts the file (you will need this, so save it or just open it in a new window).  Next, begin editing the page, you copy and paste this syntax into the first line when editing the page:

> @@[[div style="float:right; margin:0 2em 1em 2em; width:300px; border:0;"]]@@
> @@|||| [[image COPY-AND-PASTE-IMAGE-URL-HERE  width="300px"]] ||@@
> @@||||~ ^^TEXT-DESCRIBING-THE-PIC^^ ||@@
> @@[[/div]]@@

You will replace the words "COPY-AND-PASTE-IMAGE-URL-HERE" with the URL of the pic (make sure there are two SPACES between the URL and the world "width".  Add text below the pic by replacing "TEXT-DESCRIBING-THE-PIC" with your own words.

+ How do I add rating to my page?


You can allow site members to vote on your page by adding the following module to the very top of your article.  Copy and paste:

Tips for writing SCPs

++Lofwyr

* Keep it clinical, detached and orderly. This is a report, so keep to the format. Computer logs are an okay deviation, but try not to do anything else. Don't forget to check your spelling. 

* Try to find a picture for them too, where possible. Granted, not all of them can have pictures (SCP-176, SCP-974), but some would benefit from them. 

* They don't all have to be at Site 19. SCP-200, for example, is somewhere in ███████████████████████ Get some foreign ones going. 

* Don't go overboard on the containment procedures. Hideous drains on resources without a corresponding threat is poor, so don't overdo it. Every part of the procedure MUST have a reason behind it (see SCP-017, SCP-091 and SCP-847 for good examples of this).


++ Eberstrom

* If you need to remove a few words (e.g. names, places, dates), use the Unicode character █ (U+2588, FULL BLOCK). If you need to cut out substantial sections, write [DATA EXPUNGED]. 

* Be vague. If you explain something, people will say "Oh, I can handle that" - but if you don't, people will imagine the things they can't handle. And that is true horror. Err on the side of vagueness. 

* Avoid the first-person voice. 

* Don't just copy from the monstrous manual. IE SCP-024 

* Do not write dramatically. These are statements of fact, nothing more. 


Also keep in mind

* The secret underground shadow government doesn't resort to typing with the caps lock on when they want to emphasize that something must be done "at all costs". 

* Expressions such as "approximately 57.23545445 cm" appear foolish. Also, there's no need to go down to nanometers when you're writing an executive summary. 

* Use SI. That's what you use in a research report. Miles, pounds, etc. may be included in parentheses, if deemed necessary. 

* Take a look at the SCP Object Classes and assign an appropriate class to your object. For the Euclid and Keter classes, use {{euclid}} and {{keter}} to automatically add that article to the Euclid and Keter categories. 



++Kain-Pathos-Crow

* If you're dealing with a humanoid, or sentient SCP, try to avoid over using the words he/she. It's fine to use them infrequently, but when every sentence begins with "He is" "She likes" "He did this", it just doesn't read well. Like Lofwyr said, these are supposed to be clinical and detached, so they're supposed to be treated more like objects rather than actual people, at least in the research papers anyway. 

* Watch out for plot holes, because if someone notices one, it can really detract from the SCP. Just read over your SCP a couple times and make sure it makes sense. 

* If you're going to use real items or physics in your explanation, research up on them a little, just so you don't make a boo boo and accidentally say something completely wrong. It detracts from the realism that you were trying to set up. 

* Spellcheck, spellcheck, spellcheck. For the love of all that's holy (or unholy if that's your preference), check your spellings (and punctuation) before you finalize and submit a SCP. A huge amount of the editing that goes on around here are people correcting spellings or grammar. And while you're at it, no blocks of text please. It's ugly on the eyes, and shows that you can't be bothered even to make the text look pretty. 

* It's okay to be overly descriptive, but then again, it's also nice to be brief. When wondering on how long to make an SCP, go with your gut. If you feel that it'd look better with an extra couple of paragraphs, go for it. Likewise for the opposite. The guys (or girls) that frequent here are more than willing to discuss an SCP, and are ready to lay down constructive criticism, or just general kudos. 

* Avoid directly ripping off things unless it's in a satirical manner. For example, if there's an underwater city populated with mutants, giant diving suits, and creepy little girls, all due to a civil war, everyone's going to think you play a little too much Bioshock. 

* Also, try and avoid the cliché of having an SCP that'll maim/kill/insanify personnel on sight. It's just a little common. Not all the SCP have to be these hideously destructive things. The organization takes up items that are extraordinary, not just destructive, so they can be something quirky, like a children's ball pit that leads to a parallel dimension, or maybe a hospital bed that resurrects the dead, or even an average rock that when dropped or thrown, propels itself faster than the speed of sound and causes a sonic boom.

Hey, I might actually change those into SCP....



++Fritzwillie

* I want to emphasize how important it is that you avoid overused and clichéd topics like vampires and other well known mythos. It's fun to parody, it's eye-rolling to read a completely unoriginal rip-off. 

* Watch the "It's" and "Its." One is short for "it is"('as in 'It's time to go') and the other shows ownership('its teeth were enormous...'). Whether you're writing or editing, know the difference between the two. Many people go overboard one way or the other, some edit every page so that "It's" becomes "Its," and don't realize it's possessive. 

* Actually, don't be afraid of using he/she on gender owning objects. Its ridiculous when you have to use SCP-XXX two or three times in the same sentence. Also, try not to use the same words over and over, even in adjacent sentences. Redundancy is arguably bad grammar and poor sentence structure. Attempt to use synonyms without being dramatic (for example, my alternate use of 'try' and 'attempt'). 

* Log in, submit feed back, take credit and take responsibility. In reality, the only reason you'd need to be anonymous around here is to vandalize other people's work, which is ridiculously immature. If you're going to give kudos, people want to know who is admiring us, and when we enjoy a particularly good SCP, we want to know to thank for it.
