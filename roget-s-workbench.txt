[[tab Overview]]
Nine years ago, the SCP Foundation was a very different place. 

Supported by the United States' Bowe Commission, the focus was on research and development. Cross-testing and weaponization of SCP objects was common. Mobile Task Force Omega-7 ("Pandora's Box") utilized SCP-076 and SCP-105 to carry out their missions. Senior Staff members were given extreme freedom and autonomy, ignoring all rules of propriety and professionalism so long as they got the job done. All of this was endorsed by O5 Command, the High Court with their magic army.

That era was both very good and very bad for the Foundation, but it ended, and it ended badly. 

There were many incidents that catalyzed the end of the Pandora's Box era. Kondraki's destruction of Site-19. "Incident Zero." The end came when Able slaughtered the rest of Omega-7.

O5 Command realized they were losing control and cracked down. The old projects were shuttered. Senior Staff were kicked upstairs into administrative roles (and in one famous case, assassinated). Research and development of anomalous technology ceased as the Foundation refocused on mere collection and containment.

Nine years passed, and we reach the present day.

The pace of anomalous incidents is accelerating. Thousands of SCPs have been discovered in only the last few years. New GOIs are forming and being discovered every day. The Foundation can't keep up. O5 Command is becoming desperate. They wish to once again tilt the scales in their favor.

They are reopening research into SCPs outside of containment purposes. They are re-implementing cross-testing and weaponization. Endorsing in-house scientific journals. Creating an entirely new class of SCPs (Thaumiel) specifically to contain others. Re-opening old casefiles from the Bowe era, looking for old swords to resharpen for the new battles to come. 

They privately call this "Project Resurrection."

One of those old swords is Project Pandora's Box. Mobile Task Force Omega-7, now known as Alpha-9 ("Last Hope").

Not everyone is happy about this. They remember the bad old days. They worry this is going to be the end of the Foundation.

They may be right.

-----
**Project Resurrection** is a writing project aimed at reconstructing and resurrecting the original "central storyline" of the SCP Foundation.

It aims at synthesizing the old and new works of the SCP Foundation.

It starts with Alpha-9, the Omega-7 reboot. It doesn't end there.
[[/tab]]
[[tab Backstory]]
We begin with what has gone before. 

A lot of this stuff is planned to be told in flashback stories, so unless you're planning to contribute to Project Resurrection, I'd hold off so that you don't spoil what comes. 

In other words: **SPOILER WARNING**.

(If you are planning to contribute to Project Resurrection, spoil away! Let this inspire your stories.)
++ The High Court With The Magic Army

[[collapsible show="Display" hide="Hide" hideLocation="both"]]
The key to our story is O5 Command.

This storyline takes the characterization of O5 Command from Light's [http://www.scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-flytrap The Flytrap] as canon. Not so much the events, but how O5 command works.

> You hear stories -- people who some upper-level attaches to and pulls up the ranks just to play with, kids dealing with things they aren’t prepared for all, the suicides and renegades and demotion-without-honors.

> "We need the right people for our designs. You’d need to be one of us to understand."

Clef and Kondraki are good contrasting examples. The O5 Council personally okayed Kondraki's termination plans in "[[[Duke Till Dawn]]]". Clef's hilariously over-the-top plan in "[[[Termination Order]]]" was signed off by O5-7.

Interestingly, though, one of Kondraki's key character traits is that O5 Command continually tried to kill him and failed. What near-all-powerful "high court with a magic army" in charge of an ultra-powerful shadow government repeatedly tries and fails to do something as simple as kill one of their own employees?

A "high court with a magic army" //who aren't trying//.

O5 Command 'adopted' the most famous senior staff. This meant enabling them. Signing off on things they wanted to do that would get anyone else shitcanned. Stepping in, behind the scenes, to invisibly elevate them to the highest echelons. Manipulating them from afar to see what they would do. So long as they remained useful, they were given free reign to do as they wished.

Each reacted in different ways.

* **Kain** went along quietly. Given his situation: understandable. But //most// people went along in those days. Why wouldn't you? Genuine advances in science were being made. The Foundation was protecting humanity. And there was so much interesting science to be done. . .
* **Gears** adapted to the situation by incorporating O5 Command's obvious desires and paradigm into his analysis, and reacting logically to the situation from there. He was a company man through and through, but he would interpret 'what was good for the Foundation' in his own way.
* **Bright** had his own motivations. Though he remained loyal to the Foundation, his real concerns were mostly based around more personal matters. . .
* **Clef** would not have turned to the Foundation if he had any other choice. As a kind of passive resistance, though, he began to 'troll' O5 command by carrying out simple missions in elaborate, over-the-top ways. Wasting resources and pissing off his colleagues.

But **Kondraki**, the wunderkind? He embraced it at first without question. . . and then cottoned on. 

He tried to fight back. 
[[/collapsible]]

-----
++ The King is Dead

[[collapsible show="Display" hide="Hide" hideLocation="both"]]
[[[Duke Till Dawn|Gears was spot on in his assessment of Kondraki's plans. Kondraki did indeed intentionally fuck up 083's termination and breach SCP-682.]]]

Kondraki had figured out that O5 Command was using him like a puppet, pulling his strings and watching him dance. He didn't think they'd let him die. Call it nihilism. Call it art. He wanted to see what the limit was to the shit they'd let him pull. 

He probably didn't think they'd actually let SCP-682 rampage, but maybe he underestimated how all-powerful they really were. Or maybe he just didn't care; he was self-described as an antisocial bastard who couldn't give a shit about other Foundation personnel.

O5 Command didn't actually expect things to go the way they did. They expected to stand down security protocols, unleash their favorite wunderkind genius on an SCP object they wanted terminated, and sit back and enjoy a show.

Instead, they got the near-destruction of Site-19, the Foundation's biggest site.

[[[The King is Dead|On their orders, Gears assassinated Kondraki with a gunshot to the head. It was framed as a suicide. Everyone knew differently.]]]

[[[SCP-076|But the problem wasn't just Kondraki. The Site-19 event took place around the same time as Omega-7 getting wiped out by Able, resulting in the nuking of at least one major Foundation facility.]]] Around the same time, a certain Foundation researcher wiped himself and several sites from reality during some ambitious cross-testing projects, in a massive CK-class Restructuring that lost the Foundation a high number of irreplaceable assets. It was clear that the Foundation was on the verge of crisis.

So while they rebuilt Site-19, O5 Command sat down and regrouped. 

And they changed everything.
[[/collapsible]]

-----
++ The End of an Era

[[collapsible show="Display" hide="Hide" hideLocation="both"]]
O5 Command cut down drastically on their 'adoptions'. They permanently closed down Omega-7 (not difficult, since almost everyone except SCP-105 and a few others were killed either by Able or by the Area's nuke). They shut down projects relating to weaponization of SCPs. They stopped projects like Kain's Olympia Project. They mothballed his Egg Walker. They shuttered all of Kondraki's former projects and locked up his butterflies in a greenhouse.

They shut down almost all cross-testing between SCP objects. Researchers on each object now had to work in a vacuum for fear of unexpected interactions. Even more importantly, they shut down most Foundation research not aimed towards efficiency of containment.

The U.S. Government didn't like this. The Bowe Commission cried foul. O5 command responded by cutting all ties with the U.S. Government. They had served their purpose, but now the Foundation would go its own way, beholden to no one.

As for the former favored children of the O5s? They got kicked upstairs. Gears became a high-level administrator. Kain retired to his laboratory. Clef ended up having to actually do some training and development. Bright continued to be Bright: he'd always had his own agenda anyway.

New blood was brought in to replace the old. The SCP Foundation became a very different organization. Cold. Callous. Calculating. Cautious.

Nine years passed in relative calm. 
[[/collapsible]]

-----
++ Nine Years Pass

[[collapsible show="Display" hide="Hide" hideLocation="both"]]
But then something happens.

Anomalous entities start to emerge in large numbers. Old threats thought long-gone re-emerge. At Site-19, for the first time in years, a major Containment Breach occurs. And more.

O5 Command starts to feel a little desperate. They take some researchers and administrators they've had their eyes on. They begin assigning them projects investigating long-shuttered avenues of exploration for the Foundation: cross-testing, practical applications, special investigations. 

They call this, internally, "Project Resurrection."

It helps. It's not enough.

Then an unknown enemy attacks one of their Sites, and a person long-forgotten steps up and saves their asses: SCP-105. The last remnant of Mobile Task Force Omega-7. The O5s realize that redoing their biggest mistake might be the only course of action left to them.

MTF Omega-7, "Pandora's Box", was aptly named. In the original myth, opening it let all the evils into the world, and you couldn't put them back in. There was only one thing left in the box at the end. 

Hope.

And so, O5 forms a new Mobile Task Force as successor to Omega-7.

MTF Alpha-9.

"Last Hope".

[[tab Storyline]]

A lot of the stuff here covers stories that are still being written, so unless you're planning to contribute to Project Resurrection, I'd hold off so that you don't spoil what comes. 

In other words: **SPOILER WARNING**.

(If you are planning to contribute to Project Resurrection, spoil away! Let this inspire your stories.)

* **Philosophy** sections cover directives for tone and substance. Here's where we talk about the feeling of the stories we want to tell.
* **In Progress** sections cover directives for new story focus. If you want to contribute to Project Resurrection, here's where we talk about the stories we're looking for right now.
* **Foreshadowing** sections are where people ruminate on stories that might come in the far future. Things to brainstorm and mull over but not necessarily write just yet.

-----
++ Alpha-9 (Philosophy)

[[collapsible show="Display" hide="Hide" hideLocation="both"]]
A bit about where we're going with Alpha-9, first.

Generally speaking, in-universe we want the Alpha-9 project to go both **spectacularly badly** with enormous negative consequences, and **spectacularly well** with enormous positive consequences. 

You can't really write an Omega-7 sequel story without having an absolute shitload of disaster. But it's got to be overall successful within the story; if we're bothering to write this, there's no need to write the 076-2 logs writ large, and make it a yet fancier ill-conceived tragedy that just gets Shut Down Forever again. Also, that would defeat the purpose of a continuing storyline. 

And while Omega-7 was often terrible in practice, it was an entertaining, fascinating concept... but if you're still here, you probably agree with me on that. :)
[[/collapsible]]

-----
++ New Blood (In Progress)

[[collapsible show="Display" hide="Hide" hideLocation="both"]]
Part of making sure that this doesn't turn into a Senior Staff Wankfest over the old material is bringing in new blood, both in and out of universe. 

Phase One of this is the establishment of Mobile Task Force Alpha-9. We're looking for ideas for new characters (both SCPs and Agents) to take part in this new force. We're looking for stories about how the O5 Council recruits them into this mad scheme. We're looking for reactions from people on the ground when they hear Pandora's Box is being reopened.
[[/collapsible]]

++ Operation "Camp Granada" (In Progress)
[[collapsible show="Display" hide="Hide" hideLocation="both"]]
This will be one of the first stories in the "Alpha-Niner is Go!" section of the canon. In this story, MTF Beta-5 ("Babysitters") deploys in response to an outbreak of [[[SCP-008]]], with Iris and Adams in tow. . . only to find that the outbreak is going to be a bit more serious than anticipated. . .
[[/collapsible]]
-----
++ Fatherhood (Foreshadowing)
[[collapsible show="Display" hide="Hide" hideLocation="both"]]
Once upon a time, there was a man who had a child. The man's child was special. Magical. Anomalous.

The man couldn't help his child. He turned to a group called SCP Foundation to get that help. In return, he offered them the use of his peculiar set of special talents, talents that no one else had.

The deal was made. The man went to work for SCP Foundation. He did many terrible things for them. Sometimes he justified it by the fact that the world was at stake. Mostly he justified it by the fact that he loved his child and wanted to keep them safe.

But eventually, it became clear to him that the O5 Council didn't care about his child. His child was simply a tool. Leverage to keep the man's loyalty to them intact.

And so the man began to think. And he began to scheme. And he began to plan how he was going to get his child out of the trap he had put them in and get them both free.

[[/tab]] 

[[tab Characters]]
Dramatis Personae go here. (In Progress)

+ Mobile Task Force Alpha-9 ("Last Hope")
The reborn Omega-7. A Mobile Task Force explicitly intended to train and utilize humanoid SCP objects in the field.

+++ Dr. Sophia Light
Dr. Light is the reluctant director of Alpha-9. Jaded but pragmatic, she thinks that while the task force is dangerous as hell, it presents a unique opportunity to further her goals for the Foundation. If she can just avoid being assassinated long enough to bring it to fruition, it might even do some good in the world.

+++ SCP-105
Iris hates Omega-7. That whole thing went down when she was 14 to 15. It ended with Able slaughtering almost everyone and the rest dying in the nuke. Everyone she cared about within the Foundation, all dead. Then they took away her camera and locked her up in a cell. The last thing she wants is to be involved in a project like this. . . and they're asking her to lead one of the teams.

-----
+ Adjunct Mobile Task Force Lambda-2
Technically a separate Mobile Task Force for budget reasons. Currently assigned as a subordinate Task Force under Alpha-9.

+++ Dr. Clef
He's the last remnant of the Four Horsemen. He's been sitting behind a desk for nine years. He's an old soldier, cloaked in legends from his time in the field, but no longer able to carry out the missions himself. He knows this is going to end in disaster, and he's taking measures for when it does.

+++ Senior Special Agent Andrea S. Adams
Everyone thought that she was just Clef's eye-candy former secretary. She was quiet, unassuming, seemed completely safe. . . until she wasn't. Her career after leaving Clef's office was meteoric. Now she's back to working with her hated former boss. She's just as lethal as he was in his prime, but unlike Clef, she's direct and efficient where he was flashy and elaborate. Part of SCP-105's security detail (and backup plan in case she goes rogue).

-----
+ Other Foundation Staff
+++ Director Jean Karlyle Aktus
The eccentric director of Foundation Site-81 and Chair of the Foundation's Classification Committee, Aktus has existed for as long as anyone can remember. Where others have succumbed to illness and old age, Aktus has carried on, dutifully continuing his research beneath the lake where his laboratory sits. But everything has a price, and Karlyle's debt has come due. His loyalty to the Foundation is everything, and he will stop at nothing to see its designs achieved. 

+++ Dr. Daniel Horatio Aeslinger
A man out of place and quite out of his depth, Dr. Aeslinger nevertheless perseveres in an endless quest to change the world by reason alone. Amicable though blunt, he might not be the best company at parties, but then again, he rarely shows up for those. He's piqued someone's interest though, or perhaps multiple someones. Perhaps it's his unwillingness to compromise, perhaps his inability to truly get swept away by his emotions, but he's now part of their plans.

+++ Director Shirley Gillespie
The elderly Director of Site-77, who presides over one of the largest caches of Safe and Euclid level objects in the entire Foundation. Gillespie has fought tooth-and-nail to get to where she is today, and she doesn't like to beat around the bush when it comes to business. Her agenda? Pushing the limits of supposedly 'safe' objects beyond what anyone ever dreamed they were capable of. Alpha-9 seems like a perfect place to do that.

----
+ O5 Command
The thirteen people who have ultimate control over the Foundation.

* **One: "The Founder"** -- A force of tradition and stability; never seen in person, but whose presence hangs over all the others. The leader of the Council.

* **Two: "The Gardener"** -- One of the original members of the Foundation, possibly a founding member of the O5 Council. Hails from a previous iteration of the current timeline. Origins and involvement in temporal anomalies are intentionally kept murkier even than most of the Council's. //Openly supports Alpha-9//.

* **Three:** [NO FURTHER DATA AT THIS TIME]

* **Four: "The Ambassador"** -- Deals largely with Groups of Interest outside the Foundation. Walks everywhere, traveling across the world at any speed necessary, taking paths that no others can take. //Openly supports Alpha-9//.

* **Five: "Blackbird".** -- [NO FURTHER DATA AT THIS TIME]. 

* **Six: "Cowboy"** -- Wears a white Stetson "Boss of the Plains" cowboy hat. Known for exceptional stability and competence. Plays a 'jack of all trades' role within the Council, with a special focus on security.

* **Seven: "Green"** -- Dresses almost exclusively in green clothing of various degrees of fashion. Ruthless but seemingly well-intentioned. Was Dr. Alto Clef's primary sponsor nine years ago: they have since had a falling out. //Privately supports Alpha-9, but publicly opposes it for political reasons.//

* **Eight: "The Newbie"** -- Actually has seniority over several other O5s, but didn't bother finding a new nickname. As one of his first actions as O5, approved Kondraki's termination plan for SCP-083, which resulted in the destruction of Site-19 and a loss of face from which he has yet to recover. Probably the least-trusted and most reactionary member of the O5 Council. //Opposes the creation of Alpha-9, and is the most vocal opponent on the Council.//

* **Nine: "The Outsider"** -- Was recruited as O5 directly from the public -- the first and only time this has ever happened. The second newest Council member, she replaced the O5 Council member who is contained in [[[SCP-963]]]-2). //Openly supports Alpha-9//.

* **Ten: "The Archivist"** -- Acts as custodian of the records of previous iterations of the planet and associated timelines. She is the only one who knows how many times the timeline has been damaged or "reset". The newest member of the O5 Council. Her predecessor (who played the same role) was executed after trying to use [[[SCP-003]]] to end the world. //Openly supports Alpha-9//.

* **Eleven:** -- [NO FURTHER DATA AT THIS TIME]

* **Twelve:** -- [NO FURTHER DATA AT THIS TIME]

* **Thirteen:** -- Not much is known about him. He seems to have some ability to see the future, and only appears at Council meetings to cast tie-breaking votes. 

+++ O5 Command Administrative Staff ("The Factotums")
The direct subordinates to the O5 Council -- powerful enough to be valuable, but expendable enough to be useful. Everything about them is classified: their histories, their positions, their roles, their names, even their genders. Known only by their code names. They work closely both with the O5 Council and with MTF Alpha-1, "Red Right Hand."

-----
+ Villains
+++ "The Ones in Black"
Their attack on Site-17 started all this. Who they are and what they are after have yet to be revealed.

-----
+ Outsiders
+++ Alison Chao, The Black Queen

[[tab Writers' Thoughts]]
++ Grimdark, Noblebright
When writing for Project Resurrection, think less grimdark and more NobleBright.

The term "grimdark" is used to describe settings that, like Warhammer 40,000, have a certain bleak, pessimistic tone. It's hard to exactly pin down what "grimdark" really is, but if I had to break it down into five major themes:
* The world is in slow, painful, decline.
* Your best efforts will only serve to slow down the inevitable.
* Life is cheap. Death, including massive body counts, is distressingly common.
* The innocent exist to be victims of the strong.
* Heroes are naive fools.

But for every yin there is a yang. Grimdark's mirror concept is "NobleBright." Project Resurrection's view of NobleBright is not exactly happy: there are dark and gritty things, but the overall feel is less one of despair and one of hope.
* The world is emerging from an age of darkness.
* You can make a difference, no matter how small.
* Even in the midst of mass death, every life you can save is precious.
* The innocent deserve to be protected from the strong.
* Heroes are naive fools. . . but they are naive fools who can make a difference.

There need to be setbacks. There need to be losses. There need to be disasters. But in the end, there needs to be a victory, no matter how small. Something that the reader and the characters can hold onto and think, "Yes. This was worth it."

-----
++ Breaking Taboos
As part of the more adventurous, NobleBright tone, there are some long-held taboos that SCP Foundation culture has built up that we're going to explicitly break.

* **Author Avatars**: We make 'em, we use 'em, we don't worry about "no roleplaying." No rules against anomalous researchers (within moderation): there's a place for them now, within Alpha-9. No rules against fourth-wall jokes regarding on-site and off-site culture (Lambda-2, for instance, is an old MTF joke that's been gone from the MTF page for a long time).
* **No Crosslinking**: This applies both to SCP cross-testing and SCP/Tale cross-links. There may be SCPs that are created explicitly for the purposes of Project Resurrection (Subject, as usual, to community review and possible deletion). Cross-testing between SCPs may take place during the course of Project Resurrection. 
* **LOLFoundation:** Within moderation. For instance, we would not accept the very worst of Old!LOLFoundation, like Kondraki running amok without consequence. However, the fact that Old!LOLFoundation exists is an actual plot point within the story, and there is definitely room for comic-relief shenanigans within reason.

-----
++ Regarding Continuity and Canon
As much as possible, we will try to incorporate as much of the content of the site as possible. This includes Tales, SCPs, supplemental information, and commonly held headcanon. This will inevitably lead to conflict, as differing tones and headcanons duke it out. 

When considering whether something should be in canon, consider these facts:
* **Is it fun?** We want some realism: suspension of disbelief only goes so far. However, if something is going to be an interesting, fun addition to the canon, we should definitely try to add it in.
* **Does it conflict?** There are, however, going to be fun concepts that conflict with information already laid down in the Project Resurrection canon. For instance, if the Scarlet King should pop up, there's the question of which interpretation you want to accept. Which leads, at last, to:
* **Can it be justified?** Marvel Comics used to have something called The No-Prize, which was an empty envelope sent to a fan who A. found an incident of discontinuity, and B. was able to provide an explanation as to how it took place. Feel free to justify the inclusion of wildly different canons into a single story, so long as it makes sense.

-----
++ Superman as a Hero vs. Superman as a Person

Superman's powers are boring. They're just "being a better human being." He can fly, he's strong, he's bulletproof, he's fast, he can shoot lasers from his eyes and breathe out ice.

Superman as a person is interesting. He's an alien raised by humans in a small midwestern town. He has all the power in the world but uses it to help others. He's surrounded by people who he wants to help, but is always struggling with whether or not helping them means lording it over them like a god.

When creating anomalous characters for Project Resurrection, spend more time thinking about the person behind the abilities (the Clark Kent) rather than the powers (the Superman).
[[/tab]]

[[tab FAQ]]
+++ Can I write for this storyline?

Yes. Come visit us [[[Chat Guide|in chat]]] or in the discussion for this page if you have any questions.

-----
+++ I have an idea for this storyline. Where can I suggest it? 

Suggest in the comments for this hub! Otherwise, find us [[[Chat Guide|in chat]]].

Remember -- we're especially looking for more recent work (Series 2 & 3 SCPs in particular).

-----
+++ Can I use established characters and SCPs?

Yes! If the original creators of the characters are still around, just see what they think. If the creators are not part of the wiki anymore, just go for it. You can ask some of the veteran writers on the project for feedback.

-----
+++ Can I use MY established characters and SCPs?

Absolutely. Sky's the limit.

-----
+++ How can I add stories to this hub?

Just get several of the established Resurrection writers to approve it (you can find us [[[Chat Guide|in chat]]]), and you can add once you're done. This is for two purposes:

* Quality (we want to help you write something awesome, and we're happy to give you lots of feedback!)
* Continuity (so we don't confuse everyone!)

Remember, though, you can add to this storyline or write in the universe without ever checking with us. Just tag your tale with "resurrection."

-----
+++ Where can I go to voice concerns about Resurrection?

[[user TroyL]] has a thread, "[http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-1165798 Concerning Resurrection]", where you can go to post any concerns you have about the canon. If you wish to have it posted anonymously, PM TroyL so he can address it in-thread.

-----
+++ Able is so dreamy! Here's my OC who's totes in love with him!

That's not a question, but let's instead talk about OCs (Original Characters). 

Create them. Bring them in. Just make them interesting, please, so other people will want to write them.

-----
+++ Able is so awesome! Here's my OC who's totally awesome too!

Again, that's not a question. but let's instead talk about anomalous characters.

The general rule of thumb on the site is "don't make them." This rule of thumb is called the **X-Men Rule**: "If the SCP would fit right in with the X-Men, it shouldn't be an SCP."

We're tossing that. . . mostly out the window. Read "Superman vs. Clark Kent" in the Writers' Thoughts section.

[[tab Overview]]
Why do rich people care about making money?

The poor, certainly, need to care about doing so. When one's resources are only enough to scrape by, money is all that matters. It is important for the middle class as well. Looking after their spouses, their children; there is a culture of dependence that weights them down.

The rich want to make money because they can always become richer. There is always another echelon of wealth to rise above, some degree of opulence that is beyond their grasp. They drive to even further heights, seeking to slake their thirst for coin. They care about making money simply because they can. To do so, the rich exploit people far below them on the social ladder, the poorest of the poor. To the oil magnate, to the harsh dictator, to the kings and queens and lords and ladies, the common people are specks of dirt.

To Marshall, Carter and Dark, the rich are unto ants.

People, regardless of social standing, are all the same. The poor may spend their savings on worthless yet treasured trinkets, sold by the middle class. The salaryman may splurge on a pretty ring for his wife, the profits of which go into the pockets of a wealthy mining boss. In the same way, the gullible rich will burn millions of dollars on a single impossible object. Everyone is willing to waste their precious, precious money on something out of the ordinary.

But value is artificial. The poor spend their pennies on mass-produced china, convinced that it has some worth to it. The rich convince the middle class that diamonds are rare and valuable, despite the stones being retrieved in Africa by the billion. Marshall, Carter and Dark convince the rich that the impossible is invaluable, while any anartist on a street can twist a die into a hypercube.

The methodology of such a scheme is quite simple, but the critical step is to gain a market monopoly. If you are the only seller in town, you can set the price at any level you desire, so long as you can drum up demand. In this regard, Marshall, Carter and Dark have the advantage: for hundreds of years, they were the only peddlers of anomalous wares in the world. They had the time to gain the capital, and with that capital they can now outprice even the most competitive upstart.

While organisations such as the Foundation, the GOC, and the Horizon Initiative resent the company's existence, they are unable to deal with such an unassailable economic powerhouse. With a glance, Marshall, Carter and Dark could level a city, bankrupt a country; with a single call, they could plunge the planet into a thermonuclear war. Yet, to the eternal relief of all, they are the least volatile players in the anomalous field. After all, if the veil of secrecy were to break, their trinkets would become worthless; their business would crumple and dissolve.

While this may cause some to think of Marshall, Carter and Dark as a massive, faceless corporation, their workforce numbers at most in the order of one hundred personnel. Their operations are directed and streamlined, maximising efficiency and minimising cost. Further manpower, if necessary, is outsourced from other organisations. Those in the highest positions of power are perhaps the most mysterious. Wild stories abound on the subject: depending on the source, they may be ghosts or demons, old men sending messages from beyond the grave, faceless monsters from another world, or even shapeshifting lizardmen.

A major part of their operations is establishing supply lines between various anomalous groups. Marshall, Carter and Dark purchase directly from groups such as Doctor Wondertainment and The Factory, reselling their goods at exorbitant markups. Prometheus Labs gladly supply the group with their latest research, in exchange for samples of exotic and complex anomalies. They often host anart exhibitions, exerting notable control of the artistic marketplace.

Similarly, they host various social functions for the most rich and powerful people in the world. With hooks throughout Europe, America, Russia and China, there is never trouble finding a market for a given item. They are, of course, willing to sell to any buyer; groups such as the Chaos Insurgency are some of their most valuable clients.

Perhaps the organisations most opposed to Marshall, Carter and Dark are the Manna Charitable Foundation and the Serpent's Hand. Manna Charitable often attempts to sabotage their operations, due to their restrictions of anomalous goods to the upper class. However, their limited range and resources makes them more irritating than threatening. The Serpent's Hand, meanwhile, are directly and openly antagonistic: caring neither for the veil of secrecy or the company's continuing practice of anomalous human trafficking, and impossible to economically intimidate, they represent the only pervasive threat to the group's operations.

Without question, Marshall, Carter and Dark are one of the most important pieces on the chessboard of the anomalous world; occasionally putting other players into check, but never into mate. For Marshall, Carter and Dark, the planet is an intricate network they have secured safely beneath their thumb, where winning and losing are meaningless terms. There is no need to move pieces when you can move the board. When you can end the match at any time, there's only one reason to continue.

It's all about playing the game.

[[tab Object Template]]

+ General Notes

When writing an item for Marshall, Carter and Dark, it is important to keep in mind the goals of doing so. For example, the goal of an SCP object is (typically) to spend the most time explaining, in precise and scientific detail, what the item appears to be, how it is anomalous, and so on. They spend the most time describing the item. To use another example, the AWCY object template is designed to explain the motivations behind the creation of a particular piece.

For a Marshall, Carter and Dark object, the purpose is to **tell a story**.

To MC&D, the most important part of an object is who has it: keeping track of every object as it changes hands. Unlike the Foundation, a lot of MC&D's files are on objects they don't currently own, and are instead keeping track of where they are and how they are being used. Perhaps most importantly, **their documentation may include other GOI's object templates**. To illustrate this, consider an anart piece from AWCY which was then bought by MC&D, sent off to Prometheus Labs for analysis, then sold to the Chaos Insurgency, and in turn lost in a skirmish to the GOC. The MC&D documentation may therefore contain all relevant information: the AWCY project proposal, a Prometheus Labs analysis report, reports of its purchase and subsequent sale, the Chaos Insurgency's plans for using the item, and then the GOC report on the conflict which resulted in its recovery, and its subsequent internal documentation from them.

In an MC&D item, the description of the item is much smaller than in other objects. It should, in total, be under four sentences long, inclusive of any containment requirements. This does not need to be the only time that you describe it, though; there may also be a longer spiel on the object as a description for sale.

MC&D humanoids are typically not kept in cells, as is often done in the Foundation, instead being kept in drug-induced comas and fed via tube. MC&D have no equivalent of the Foundation's Ethics Committee, and as a primarily results-oriented group, their handling of objects should reflect efficiency without regard for the self-determination of their sentient wares. On the other hand, they highly value both their own personnel and their customers, and take every step to ensure their safety.

MC&D objects are **always referred to as 'items'** in documentation; pronouns such as 'object' or 'subject' are not to be used.

+ Theme
To use the MC&D custom theme, put the following at the top of your page:

[[code]]
[[module CSS]]
@import url(/component:MCD-theme/code/1);
[[/module]]
[[/code]]

+ Header

||||~ XXXXX/XXXXX/XXXXX||
||~ Status||In Reserve /Selling /Sold /Renting /Acquirable /Unacquirable /Destroyed /Unknown||
||~ Demand||High/Medium/Low/None||
||~ Value||(Price Range in USD and GBP)/Not for Sale||
||~ Availability||None/Unique/Current Inventory (Numerical Value), Estimated (Numerical Value) Worldwide/Established Supply Chain||
||~ Identifier||An Identifying Name||
||~ Description||A brief description of the item, detailing only its physical properties. This should not be particularly long, and is more of an executive summary. A good rule of thumb is to make it four sentences long.||
||||~ Marshall, Carter and Dark, LLP||

The above header should be used at the top of all objects. The following is a description of each criteria:

**File Number:** In the above template, XXXXX/XXXXX/XXXXX is used as **an identifier for the document**. Each X should be replaced with a nonzero and non-unary digit or a capital letter; for example, a valid identifier is IWN45/N3OS8/4EGI5. The number 0 is not to be used in the identifier, as it can be easily confused with the letter O in documentation; similarly, 1 is not to be used as it can be mistaken with I. This numerical identifier is not used as an identifier for the item itself, as with SCP objects, but an identifier for the file. Items themselves are referred to by their Identifier in daily business (see below), but within the document are only to be referred to as 'item' or 'the item'.

**Status:** This refers to the **current status** of the item. The different classes mean, as follows:
In Reserve: The item is owned by MC&D, but currently not for rent or sale.
Selling: The item is owned by MC&D, and is currently for sale.
Sold: The item is no longer owned by MC&D, and has been sold. This category should also include a subcategory of Acquirable, Unacquirable, Destroyed, or Unknown, parsed as Sold (Acquirable), Sold (Unacquirable) and so on.
Renting: The item is owned by MC&D, and is currently available for rent or being rented.
Acquirable: The item is either owned by MC&D but not in its posession, as may be the case of items currently undergoing analysis by external contractors, or not owned by MC&D but trivially capable of being requisitioned from its current owner.
Unacquirable: The item is not currently owned by MC&D, and acquiring it would require sizeable effort.
Destroyed: The item has been destroyed.
Unknown: The current status of the item is unknown, and is thus either Unacquirable or Destroyed.

**Demand:** This is an **approximation of the demand for the item**. If an item can be easily sold at any time, it is rated High; if it is likely to find a buyer at auction, it is rated Medium; Low items are unlikely to sell at auction and may have a very specific market. The None category is when the item has no demand whatsoever. Demand categories can be combined as High/Medium or Medium/Low for approximations that span these ranges.

**Value:** This is not the true monetary value of the item, but **the price at which it can be sold or rented**. This is given in a range for unique or limited items, while items which are available via supply chain should have a specific stated cost per item. This should not be overly specific, with value stated to fewer than three significant figures. If the item is being rented, then this should be a fixed price to rent the item, either per hour or per day. If the item is unsuitable for sale, then this row simply reads Not for Sale.

**Availability:** This is the **availability of the item**. If it is None, then the item has been destroyed. A Unique item is one of a kind, for example, subdued reality benders should always be unique. The category 'Current Inventory (Numerical Value), Estimated (Numerical Value) Worldwide' is self explanatory, while Established Supply Chain means that MC&D can order in copies of the object on demand.

**Identifier:** The Identifier is the **common name for the item**; it is the name that it is bought or sold under, and the way that objects are commonly referred to in MC&D standard operating. This identifier must be unique, and normally descriptive, except in the cases such as anart items, where the name of the piece is used. As stated above, this Identifier is not to be used to refer to the item within the documentation.

**Description:** The Description section, quite simply, **describes the item**. This section should not describe anything to do with the current owner of the item, the creator of the item, or anything besides a pure description of the item in its current state. This includes both a physical description, as well as a description of its anomalous properties. It should be as short as possible without omitting information; a good rule of thumb is four sentences long. It is not necessary to be overly scientific with this description; plain language explanations are more useful.

**Postscript:** This is a simple postscript; it may read Marshall, Carter and Darke, Ltd. or Marshall, Carter and Dark, Ltd. for older reports, and Marshall, Carter and Dark, LLP for newer ones.

The following are two example headers:

||||~ IWN45/N3OS8/4IGI5||
||~ Status||Selling||
||~ Demand||High||
||~ Value||120USD/80GBP per Piece, 2000USD/1200GBP per Packet, 100000USD/60000GBP per Crate||
||~ Availability||Established Supply Chain||
||~ Identifier||Dr. Wondertainment's Bubblebath Bonbons!® ('Bloodbaths' internally)||
||~ Description||Items are small ingestible sweets wrapped as bags of 20, for purchase from supplier in crates of 64. On consumption, items cause blood to be released from the skin as foam. Consumption of multiple pieces over a short time can cause death via blood loss.||
||||~ Marshall, Carter and Darke, Ltd.||


||||~ TSKTG/DS6G9/9D6S9||
||~ Status||In Reserve||
||~ Demand||Medium/Low||
||~ Value||Not for Sale||
||~ Availability||Current Inventory 1, Estimated 3 Worldwide||
||~ Identifier||Farting Butt||
||~ Description||Item is a floating disembodied human bottom which constantly passes highly flammable gas. Item has been fused to a standard gas-powered engine for use as an energy source. One cheek of item has been branded with Marshall, Carter and Dark insignia.||
||||~ Marshall, Carter and Dark, LLP||

+ Compulsory Subsections
After the Header, the following subsections must be included in order. There should be only one of each of these subsections.

++ Initial Report
The subsection which should normally begin your article should be a brief summary of how the object first came to the attention of MC&D. 

IMPORTANT: Dates must always be in the format Month DD, YYYY as below, to prevent confusion with American/International dating systems.

||||||||~ Initial Report||
||~ Author || Full Name ||~ Date || Month DD, YYYY||
||~ Interest||High/ Medium/ Low/ None||~ Identifier||An Identifying Name||
||||||||How did MC&D first find this item? This is the place where you should detail that particular event, as either a first person description from the perspective of the author, or as a third person overview of the event. _
 _
Of important note is the line break code within tables, where an underscore, _, must be used at the end of any line rather than simply pressing enter within the editor. Thus, if you're copying an MC&D document to Wikidot from an external word processor, it might need some editing. View the page source to see how this works.||
||||~ File Opened Under:|||| XXXXX/ XXXXX/ XXXXX ||
||||||||~ Marshall, Carter and Dark, LLP||

Most of these should be self explanatory; Interest is the **amount of interest that MC&D has in possessing the item**, rather than any potential market interest. The identifier used here should be the same as the one used above.

++ Tracking Information/Inventory Information
**Only one of either Tracking Information or Inventory Information is to be used for a given item.**

Tracking Information is used for a unique or very limited item. Any time that the object changes hands should be logged here. This should be complete and up to date. Documentation should be similar to the following example:

||||||~ Tracking Information||
||||||~ XXXXX/XXXXX/XXXXX ||
||~ Owner ||~ Date ||~ Comments||
|| Archibald Fenswick || April 07, 2005 || Initial Discovery. ||
|| Marshall, Carter and Dark LLP || April 17, 2005 || Fenswick approached with monetary offer, rejected; reposessed item after his being committed to an insane asylum (Incident Report 1)||
|| Prometheus Laboratories || June 19, 2005 || Item was provided to Prometheus Laboratories for analysis. ||
|| Marshall, Carter and Dark LLP || June 28, 2005 || Item returned from Prometheus Labs (External Document 1). ||
|| Hendrick Szilard || November 19, 2005 || Item sold at auction. (Auction Record 1)||
|| Marshall, Carter and Dark LLP || January 22, 2006 || Item reposessed from Hendrick Szilard post-mortem. (Incident Report 2)||
|| Louis Kincaid || March 07, 2006 || Item sold at auction. (Auction Record 2) ||
|| Marshall, Carter and Dark LLP || June 22, 2006 || Item reposessed from Louis Kincaid post-mortem. (Incident Report 3) ||
|| Various || August 23, 2006 || Item rented. (Rental Record 1) ||
|| Marshall, Carter and Dark LLP || June 03, 2008 || Item removed from rental, being held in stores indefinitely. (Incident Report 4) ||
|| Serpent's Hand || August 02, 2012 || Item found missing upon standard inventory checks; video recordings revealed Serpent's Hand operatives stealing the item. (Incident Report 4)||
|| Global Occult Coalition || March 07, 2014 || See External Document 2. ||
||||||||~ Marshall, Carter and Dark, LLP||

For items which there are multiple instances, or where there are established supply chains, Inventory Information is used instead. These should be formatted like the following example, the documentation for Dr. Wondertainment's Bubblebath Bonbons!®:

||||||~ Inventory Information||
||||||~ IWN45/N3OS8/4IGI5 ||
||~ Owner ||~ Quantity ||~ Comments||
|| Marshall, Carter and Dark LLP || 48640 (38 Crates) || Available from Supplier on demand. ||
|| Global Occult Coalition || 27 || Currently kept in storage as samples.||
|| The Foundation || 582 || Stored as SCP-1079; low level security. ||
|| The Chaos Insurgency || ~2000 || Items distributed amongst low-level personnel for use as assassination tools. ||
|| Doctor Wondertainment || N/A || Supplier. ||
|| Customers || ~5000 || Items commonly purchased for use as practical jokes. ||
|| Others || ~1000 || 100 crates entered into circulation prior to establishing exclusivity of supply; few untracked items believed to exist. ||
||||||||~ Marshall, Carter and Dark, LLP||

+ Additional Subsections
The following subsections can be used multiple times after the Compulsory Subsections as required.

++ Rental Records
This section should document a sample period over which the item was rented, to whom, and comments regarding what they did with it for the duration of its renting.

||||||||~ Rental Record XX||
||||||||~ XXXXX/XXXXX/XXXXX ||
||~ Name ||~ Date ||~ Period ||~ Comments||
|| Ibrahim Yates || April 03, 1992 || 8 Days || Used for topiary purposes.||
|| Billy Bobberson || June 19, 1992 || 2 Days || Used for practical jokes.||
|| Steph McGee || June 22, 1992 || 5 Days || Used in retaliation for practical jokes.||
|| Obvious Pseudonym || July 24, 1992 || 74 Days ||  ||
|| Abraham Lincoln || April 03, 1993 || 1 Day ||  ||
|| Elephant Man || April 27, 1994 || 18 Days || Used item for facial reconstruction. ||
||||||||~ Marshall, Carter and Dark, LLP||

++ Auction Records
If the item is unique and has been sold, this subsection should detail an auction for it, as well as all bidders on the object. It should also include the description provided to purchasers for the listing. This description should be different from the description in the Header: the purpose of this one is to sell it to a target market.

||||||||~ Auction Record XX||
||||||||~ XXXXX/XXXXX/XXXXX ||
||~ Date || October 22, 1918 ||~ Location || London ||
||~ Auctioneer || Selleroff Stuff ||~ Lot || 27 of 132 ||
||~ Listing |||||| An over-the-top description of the item, the aim of which is to entice people who are potential buyers into purchasing the object. This can be as long as you desire, or rather, as long as makes sense; the previous 'four sentence' rule can be safely ignored. You should describe the properties of the object, but are free to hide details which would detract from its saleability, such as potential negative side effects. It should conclude with the following sentence, or some variation on the warning. //Marshall, Carter and Dark LLP takes no responsibility for the misuse of this item.// ||
||~ Name ||~ Bid ||||~ Comments||
|| Faust Bitter || 27000USD ||||  ||
|| Whemote Byer || 32000USD |||| Proxy bidder for Esselwex Lestroud. ||
|| Faust Bitter || 33000USD ||||  ||
|| Whemote Byer || 40000USD |||| Proxy bidder for Esselwex Lestroud. ||
|| Rei Sing Pryces || 50000USD |||| MC&D bid raiser to increase cost. ||
|| Whemote Byer || 55000USD |||| Proxy bidder for Esselwex Lestroud. ||
|| Faust Bitter || **60000USD** ||||~ Winner of auction. ||
||||||||~ Marshall, Carter and Dark, LLP||

++ Sale Records
If the item is part of an established supply chain, or a large stockpile are owned, then items are sold at a fixed price on demand. Depending on the time period that the item has been being sold for, this section should track either monthly or yearly sales records for the item, along with comments on any particular abnormalities in sales numbers. While MC&D retains details of every sale, it would be boring both to write and read through; it is recommended no more than two years or two decades of records should be in one of these sections. The following is sample documentation in the format that should be used, again for the example of Dr. Wondertainment's Bubblebath Bonbons!®:

||||||~ Sale Records||
||||||~ IWN45/N3OS8/4IGI5 ||
||~ Records From:||||July, 2006 to June, 2007||
||~ Month ||~ Sold ||~ Comments||
|| July, 2006 || 879 ||  ||
|| August, 2006 || 387 ||  ||
|| September, 2006 || 852 ||  ||
|| October, 2006 || 10482 || Halloween spike. ||
|| November, 2006 || 879 ||  ||
|| December, 2006 || 5820 || Christmas spike. ||
|| January, 2007 || 1298 ||  ||
|| February, 2007 || 2034 ||  ||
|| March, 2007 || 29381 || April Fools' spike. ||
|| April, 2007 || 20482 || Tail from April Fools. ||
|| May, 2007 || 5924 || Popularity drops mid-month. ||
|| June, 2007 || 284 || Popularity dwindling; the joke's old until next year. ||
||||||||~ Marshall, Carter and Dark, LLP||

++ Incident Reports
Incident Reports are used by MC&D for any notable events surrounding the item. They are internal documents only written by MC&D personnel.

||||||||~ Incident Report XX||
||||||||~ XXXXX/XXXXX/XXXXX ||
||~ Author || Full Name ||~ Date || Month DD, YYYY||
|||||||| Within this box, you should completely detail the event from either the perspective of the Author or as a third-person recounting of events. Any and all important events before, during, and after the incident should be recorded here. _
 _
As before, use underscores for next lines.||
||||||||~ Marshall, Carter and Dark, LLP||

++ Internal Memos
Short messages between MC&D employees.

||||||||~ Memo XX||
||||||||~ XXXXX/XXXXX/XXXXX ||
||~ Sender || Amos Marshall ||~ Recipient || Ruprecht Carter||
|||||||| A short memo from one person to another should be included here. Perhaps thoughts on the marketability of the item, negotiations with the supplier, or anything else that would be relevant enough to include in the file. _
 _
As always, use underscores for line breaks.||
||||||||~ Marshall, Carter and Dark, LLP||

++ External Documents

Documents on the item which were not written by MC&D, instead having been acquired from another Group of Interest, should be included as External Documents.

||||||||~ External Report XX||
||||||||~ XXXXX/XXXXX/XXXXX ||
||~ Organisation || Group of Interest ||~ Acquired || Month DD, YYYY||
||~ Method of Acquisition |||||| Brief explanation of how MC&D acquired the document, potentially referring to an attached Incident Report in which it was recovered. ||
||||||||~ Document ||
|||||||| Within this box, reproduce the external document in full. _
 _
As always, end every line with an underscore, _, to make sure it formats correctly in the table.||
||||||||~ Marshall, Carter and Dark, LLP||

++ Custom Subsections

If it makes sense for a subsection not in these example subsections to be used, you are free to design your own. All subsections should have the same format as follows, with content modified to suit.

||~ Custom Subsection||
||~ XXXXX/XXXXX/XXXXX ||
||The content of your custom subsection should be included in here; feel free to subdivide the table as you see fit. Do not remove the File Number or the postscript.||
||~ Marshall, Carter and Dark, LLP||

[[tab Author Notes]]
//A letter from Cain//
My work for the team was probably the most time consuming, not because my writing posed any more challenge than the others, but because I made and make sure that A Darke Tale is as historically accurate as possible. This meant rereading an entire textbook, as well as any documents and articles that helped me shape characters and events that I focused on in the story. I was very fortunate to have a former teacher of mine assist me more than once, and send me advice and articles for my research. Heavy collaboration with Randomini was paramount, as our stories were designed to exist in the same universe.

While I don’t intend to open up writing in the Darke Tale saga to others, I would encourage you to follow my steps if you mean to write something in the same vein. After you’ve sculpted an idea, do your research. Know what you’ll need to know, and read as much as you can about it. This may continue to shape your plans, and if not, will certainly help you when you put pen to paper. Then create an outline. Randomini was better about this than I was. This outline won’t be seen by many people, and it won’t be rated by anyone, so this is the least rewarding part of the process. It’s also the most important, because it will give you a path to follow. You’re not blindly groping in the Darke for a plot. You’ve got a skeleton to work through, and that you can refer to. After that, you start knocking out your stories, which is a process as subjective and intuitive as you can imagine.

But a note on outlining a historical fiction story arc, about MC&D, Darke, Dark, the Horizon Initiative, or even those boring grey Russian groupies. As I do it, I’m working through the American history textbook __Enduring Vision__. Chapter after chapter, line by line of history and minutiae (and minutiae and minutiae -- it’s a thorough book). I read, and I think, and I consider and reconsider. How does this factor into what I need to accomplish with Percival Darke? Where do I need him to be and when, for what reason, and what can I say, what commentary can I provide from the perspective of what characters, and what’s too much? It goes on, and makes reading a very slow, if satisfying process. Each chapter I think through with consideration to what’s happened and what I know will happen in history. This I use to put down a few lines of synopsis for each tale that needs to be put down. I only break them down by what I think is an appropriate amount of content, and title them based on that. Eventually I have a series. Then I can begin to write from beginning to end (or however -- another great thing about writing with a rubric is that it also allows you to move around and put pins in the stories you’re not sure about yet) with distinct accomplishment. I know Randomini has some magic logarithm he uses to number his tales and acts per series with the intention of dethroning Roget as You-See-Where-I’m-Going-With-This-Joke, but I don’t recommend this method. It makes it necessary to fill a quota of plot for each tale and may be difficult to pull off by more novice writers. There’s also a greater chance of snagging yourself in the story. Most of you will write a story arc the same way that I do, by fitting tales in where they feel like they belong.

//A letter from Randomini//
My work for the team was probably the most time consuming, not because my writing posed any more challenge than the others, but because I had to write //twenty nine fucking tales//. This meant writing an entire book, as well as any intermissions and articles that helped me shape characters and events that I focused on in the story. Heavy collaboration with Cain was paramount, as our stories were designed to exist in the same universe and that guy basically needs his hand held every step of the way.

While I don’t intend to open up writing in the Wills and Ways saga to others, I would encourage you to follow my steps if you mean to write something in the same vein. After you’ve sculpted an idea, forget about it and just bullshit. Don't learn anything, don't plan anything, just write some bullshit and it will probably be fine. This may continue to shape your plans, and if not, will certainly help you when you put pen to paper. Then create an outline, and then throw it away, because forward planning is for chumps. It won’t be rated by anyone, so why bother? It’s the least important, as it restricts you to a thin, confined storyline with no flexibility. You’re stuck with a path that could lead you off the edge of a cliff. Be like a long reed: flexible, bending to the wind, and also photosynthesize. After that, you start knocking out your stories, which is the least rewarding part of the process.

But a note on outlining an urban fantasy story arc, about MC&D, Darke, Dark, the Horizon Initiative, or even those boring grey Russian groupies. As I do it, I’m basically bullshitting the whole thing without a goddamn clue. Any time I need to know something, I look it up on Wikipedia, so it is almost always wrong. Often I use Google Translate and do some stupid language bullshit. How does this factor into what I need to accomplish with Iris Dark? Where do I need her to be and when, for what reason, and what can I say, what commentary can I provide from the perspective of what characters, and can I somehow write something that passes the Bechdel test? I was able to do so, but I have regretted it every second since. Each chapter I write I think through with consideration to what’s happened and how I can most annoy the readers with trivial bullshit, like 1000 words dedicated to picking a lock. This I ignore and then hammer the keyboard, relying on autocorrect to parse the random strings into a coherent sentence. I only break them down by the smallest possible size, so that the number of things that I wrote looks enormous. Eventually I have a 'series'. Then I can begin to write from beginning to end (or however -- another great thing about writing with a rubric is that it also allows you to move around and put pins in the stories you’re not sure about yet) with distinct accomplishment. I know Cain likes to plan ahead rather than just pretending as though he knows what he's doing and pulling something out of his asshole at the eleventh hour, but I don’t recommend this method. It is a lot less stressful, and constantly regretting your life decisions is a major part of writing. There’s also a greater chance of making something that people will enjoy. Most of you will write a story arc the same way that I do, by faking it until you make it.
