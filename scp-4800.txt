**Item #:** SCP-4800

**Object Class:** Parauniversal

**Containment Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** The process of SCP-4800 is not to be interfered with in any way. No effort is to be undertaken to explore instances of SCP-4800-A or communicate with them. Scranton Reality Anchors and other devices built to extract reality levels from alternate timelines are to be programmed to avoid targeting SCP-4800-A instances. These procedures have been unanimously agreed on by all instances of the SCP Foundation in the Multiversal Foundation Alliance.

In the event that a current timeline is subject to SCP-4800, all documents containing information pertinent to world history are to be migrated to a DEEPWELL server. No measures are to be undertaken to halt or reverse SCP-4800.

Efforts to contact Timeline E-2a0e8a129b are to continue.

**Description:** SCP-4800 is a presently unclear factor, force, or phenomenon responsible for the merging of parallel timelines. The exact cause of SCP-4800 is uncertain; however, it is hypothesized that [DATA REDACTED 5/MULTIU – SEE ADDENDUM 03]

Due to its nature, the inner process of SCP-4800 is difficult to observe. However, SCP-4800 can be observed from the outside, and proceeds as follows:

* The affected timelines (collectively SCP-4800-A, individually SCP-4800-A1 and SCP-4800-A2) will become inaccessible, and matter will not be able to enter or exit SCP-4800-A through multiversal channels. Photons are still able to be transmitted, allowing for temporary inter-universal communication.
* The sky on Earth will become black, and all visible stars will disappear. This is believed to be due to SCP-4800 fundamentally altering the properties of light to introduce resistance in vacuums. In addition, medium-to-long range data transmission becomes impossible for reasons that are presently uncertain. This effect has been observed on all planets during SCP-4800, and will last from two hours to five years before transitioning to the next phase.
* At this point, communication between SCP-4800-A and other timelines becomes impossible. SCP-4800-A2 will slowly dissolve, shrinking until all of its mass has disappeared. This process has been known to take several decades to complete.
* SCP-4800-A1 will reopen.

After SCP-4800, the resulting timeline will have elements of both instances of SCP-4800-A's histories. Events that the two timelines have in common will remain intact and not repeat[[footnote]]For example, the formation of Earth or the evolution of //Homo sapiens//.[[/footnote]]; however, individual elements[[footnote]]Such as certain events or decisions.[[/footnote]] will be included in the resulting timeline. No evidence of SCP-4800-related phenomena have been preserved; it is believed that SCP-4800 reverses the timeline to the beginning of the phenomena[[footnote]]As a result, SCP-4800-affected timelines will lag behind other timelines. Due to the rate of SCP-4800 occurrence, this time difference will eventually equalize.[[/footnote]].

SCP-4800 will generally target timelines with less than [[[SCP-3022|43°]]] of difference. No other common factors have been discovered in SCP-4800's choice of target universe. The current timeline has been the subject of several SCP-4800 events, which have been catalogued in Addendum 02. It is estimated that over 3000 timelines in the LTG[[footnote]]Local Timeline Group[[/footnote]] are currently undergoing SCP-4800.

[[include component:image-block name=meeting.jpg|caption=Meeting of representatives of the Multiversal Foundation Alliance to decide upon a consensus definition of SCP-4800. Sensitive information expunged.]]

**Addendum 01:** Discovery

SCP-4800 was first discovered after the Foundation was contacted by SCPF-7a5f7b[[footnote]]Designation for an alternate timeline's version of the Foundation. SCPF-7a5f7b developed multiverse transversal technology earlier than the baseline Foundation, and was instrumental in accelerating the baseline Foundation's technology to allow for multiversal travel.[[/footnote]] in early 1986. SCPF-7a5f7b had been observing our timeline's history, and shared information that proved that several new events were present that had not existed before 1986. It was also shared that our universe had been inaccessible to them for 23 years, and that these events began to exist after this period.

However, SCP-4800 was first observed by the Foundation after the development of DEEPWELL servers[[footnote]]DEEPWELL servers are specialized data storage servers that are able to preserve information across shifts in reality. They function by encoding their information on a two-dimensional object isolated into both of the temporal dimensions, rather than using hard-drives in the three spatial dimensions. A limitation of this is that DEEPWELL servers are unable to preserve limitations across temporal shifts; due to this, DEEPWELL servers can retain information about history prior to SCP-4800, but not events after SCP-4800 has begun.[[/footnote]] in 1990. At this time, documents related to consensus world history were stored on DEEPWELL servers. Comparison between documents stored on DEEPWELL Server #987 and current consensus world history by AI construct ERIS.AIC revealed that several events had occurred that did not align with the past timeline. This, combined with evidence provided by SCPF-7a5f7b, lead to the direct observation of E-5b0b3a and E-904ff2, two alternate timelines that were inaccessible for reasons unknown at the time. After the dissolution of E-904ff2 and the history modifications made to E-5b0b3a, SCP-4800 was classified.

<p><b>Foreword:</b> The following is a broadcast made by the channel "BBC News" shortly after the beginning of the SCP-4800 event.

<p><b>Traskton:</b> Good... evening, I'm, I am, Robert Traskton, and we at BBC News have some, um, very urgent news!</p>
<p><b>Ferdinand:</b> That's right. All over the world, people are reporting that the sky has prematurely turned to night. In addition, several people have reported a loss of access to satellite television, phone lines, and the internet.</p>
<p><b>Traskton:</b> Yeah, we got into contact with an astronomer who can tell us who's happening, I mean, what's happening. Let's go to astronomer, uh, Jerry Sprinkler, and our interviewer!</p>
<p><i>Scene cuts to an observatory. Interviewer Tracy Skullard is talking to Jerry Sprinkler</i></p>
<p><b>Skullard:</b> What can you tell us, about, well, what's happening out there?</p>
<p><b>Sprinkler:</b> As far as we can tell, the Sun's light stopped reaching us, for lack of a better word. For reasons we really haven't gotten to the botom of yet, the heat's still coming, we're still alive, but light isn't going into Earth's atmosphere, and it isn't coming out.</p>
<p><b>Skullard:</b> Is that why the stars are gone?</p>
<p><b>Sprinkler:</b> Yes, and it's also why the internet's down. We can't get to the satellites because they're outside of Earth's atmosphere. I assume you're using a landline to call back to HQ? The only exception to this, it seems, is a recurring radio signal that just says the same-</p>

<p>I've been staring at this damned sequence for hours now. This could be the thing that gets us out of this mess. This could be the <i>key</i> to SCP-4800. We might even be able to harness it. Yet, I can't even begin to crack it.</p>

<p>The dissolution field is starting to approach Earth. We have to hurry before it evaporates us. Everybody at the site in panicking. I never thought I'd see Calvin have a nervous breakdown, but here I am.</p>
<p>I've taped a printout of the code above my bed, and I spent most of the day looking at it. Why won't it work? Why can't I figure out what's going on?</p>
<p><b>6/02/2020</b></p>
<p>Code still not broken. I've talked with the others in Cryptography, and there's still no dice.</p>
<p>I keep forgetting the email system is down. Makes communication a lot harder.</p>
<p>Come on, brain. Don't fail me now.</p>
<p><b>6/12/2020</b></p>
<p>I had an epiphany today. This definitely isn't morse code, but what if it <i>isn't</i> a code? I turned it sideways, and it looks more like sets of dots seperated by dashed to me. It's not conveying letters, it's conveying <i>numbers</i>.</p>
<p>With that break in the case, I was riding on that high all day while I was decoding it. Yes, it's a bunch of numbers. It looks like there's a pattern too, but I can't see it yet.</p>
<p>I tried to send it to the rest of Cryptography, but the email's still broken. I'll talk to them when I get to work today.</p>
<p><b>6/13/2020</b></p>
<p>None of the numbers go over 16. I might be onto something here.</p>
