**Item #:** SCP-1991

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1991 is to be stored in a 5x5x5 meter containment chamber within Site 19's biological specimens wing. Due to the specimen's behavior a locked door is considered to be all that is required to prevent escape. SCP-1991 is to be fed three kilograms (3 kg) of cooked and pulped beef daily. Water is to be provided via a trough which is to be kept refilled constantly. Containment cell is to be cleaned weekly by Class-D personnel.

**Description:** SCP-1991 is a two (2) meter-long quadruped mammalian creature of unknown species enhanced by the implantation of cybernetic compounds. Both implanted compounds and creature show signs of damage consistent with extreme age, poorly healed puncture wounds, bullets of assorted calibers embedded underneath the skin, burns comparable to those produced by industrial cutting lasers, and starvation. SCP-1991 appears to have suffered psychological damage as a result of physical abuse or trauma, displaying extreme fear of loud noises, rapid movements, aggression or seeming aggression by personnel.

SCP-1991's body core is roughly humanoid, with elongated limbs of equal length. All limbs end in "hands" similar to those of a large primate apart from the presence of elongated claws. The head resembles a mummified canine skull with elongated incisor teeth. Skin resembles decayed leather with matted fur growing from it, primarily around the ankles and back of the neck. SCP-1991 lacks a tail. When recovered SCP-1991 displayed traits of starvation including enlarged gut and enunciated limbs. Proper feeding while in containment has been shown to cure said traits.

Cybernetics consist of a mechanical "collar", implantation of unidentified structure into right forelimb, sharpened steel blades replacing teeth and claws of forelimbs as well as [DATA EXPUNGED] system alterations of unknown usage. "Collar" consists of a metal disc imbedded in the front of the neck, possessing a small speaker array (nonfunctional due to bullet damage), six (6) video cameras, two (2) of which have broken lenses, and a complex network of [DATA EXPUNGED] fibers apparently serving as linkage/control to its central nervous system (nonfunctional due to ██████). Due to the nonfunctional nature of linkage between its nervous system and the camera network on the "shield", SCP-1991 appears to be blind. The "right forelimb structure" consists of a pair of miniature mechanical clamps and an extending, rotary metal rod similar to the triggering equipment of remotely operated firearms. It is assumed that the clamps were intended to serve as the mounting system for such a weapon.
