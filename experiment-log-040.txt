title:Experiment Log 040
**Experiment Log of:** [[[kain pathos crow s author page |Professor Kain Pathos Crow]]], utilizing [[[SCP-040]]] in obtaining base materials for the "[[[Olympia Project]]]".

# **Pre-Experiment Note:**
//I think it's about time we started trying to utilize 040's abilities, or at the very least, allowing her to use them enough to actually learn how to control them. She will not be able to rely on the [[[SCP-148]]] hairpieces forever. We theorized that as she gets older, her powers will increase exponentially, possibly to the point where her unconscious telepathy cannot be contained.//

//At the moment, she doesn't seem to have a fully conscious grip on her abilities at the moment either, allowing her subconscious to take over when she begins to use them. She says its easier to do that way, but that she doesn't always know what the thing she working on will become, or sometimes even what she's doing.//

//I'm going to have her perform a set amount of exercises. We'll start with small things, such as pebbles, odd bits of debris, that sort of thing, and she's going to try and change them into something we agree on, like some sort of crustacean or insect.//

**Post-Experiment Note:**
//Well... That could have gone better.//

//The beginning of the experiment went badly. 040 was nervous about trying this in front of so many people, and that anxiousness reflected itself in the things that she produced. Most were vicious, often baring fangs, claws and poison sacks at anyone who ventured near, despite 040's best efforts. Most of them we had to terminate out of simply for safety reasons. She wasn't happy about that.//

//But she improved towards the end of the session, although she still couldn't firmly nail down the process, often becoming incoherent and unstable while she performed. Still, it's not a worst case scenario. She's performing well for a first try under supervision. Still be a little while before she's able to able to do anything on the scale I'm hoping. She just needs more practice.//

# **Pre-Experiment Note:**
//I think 040 is a little more prepared today, but she still seemed a little anxious. Not as much as she did yesterday thankfully, but its still there. At least she's stopped those little episodic delusions of grandeur. Those were a little disturbing.//

//We're going to attempt the same as yesterday, although if she improves significantly, we'll move onto the next subject group. But for the moment, we'll simply stick to small things.//

**Post-Experiment Note:**
//Today did go better than yesterday, considerably better than yesterday in fact, but not good enough to progress to the next level of testing. 040 still has trouble with control. Out of the twenty five time we had her use her abilities, she was only able to give us the results we wanted three times, and it seems that even then, it was more of a fluke than anything else. Still more practice required. We're going to have to break this block between her and her powers. And to do that, we may have to employ slightly more... stressful measures.//
