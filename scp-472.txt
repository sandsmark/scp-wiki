**Item #:** SCP-472

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-472 is to be kept in the center of an empty, locked cell of dimensions 9.3 m^^2^^ (100 ft^^2^^). All personnel wishing to enter for research purposes must undergo a psychological evaluation and submit a research request before being permitted entry. Personnel should not remain within 18 m (60 ft) of the stone for more than five (5) minutes without being directly monitored by security personnel.

Once every two (2) months, one or more D-Class personnel must be exposed to SCP-472 for a period of ten (10) minutes or longer.

**Description:** SCP-472 is a highly valuable cut and polished 7.9 carat Burmese ruby. The phrase "For man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart" has been engraved in 2 mm (0.08 in) high lettering on the surface of the ruby.

When any organism possessing a heartbeat passes within an 18 m (60 ft) radius of SCP-472, that subject will begin to hear the distant beating of a heart within their head.  The heartbeat heard directly corresponds with the subject's own heartbeat, with the frequency of the palpitations increasing or decreasing with the pulse of the subject. Prolonged exposure causes a variety of additional psychological effects.

**5-7 minutes**: Low-level feelings of unease and anxiety. Effects cease immediately on vacating area.
**6-21 minutes**: Gradually increasing feelings of anxiety and paranoia. Effects decrease on vacating area and cease within 5 minutes.
**18-34 minutes**: High-level feelings of anxiety and paranoia. Subject begins to hallucinate, reporting seeing the world around them tinged with red and hearing vague whispering noises. 27% of subjects also report strong feelings of guilt. Effects decrease within 20 minutes of vacating area and cease within 60 minutes.
**34-59 minutes**: Hallucinations increase and become more vivid and visual; frequent hallucinations include rivulets of blood trailing down the walls, images of dead bodies, thumping, screaming, and ambulatory corpse-like humanoid figures. 65% of subjects rendered mentally incapable of leaving the influence of SCP-472. Effects decrease within 60 minutes of vacating area and cease within 3 hours.
**55-69 minutes**: 100% of subjects rendered mentally incapable of leaving the influence of SCP-472. Further increased hallucinations. Effects decrease within 6 hours of vacating area and cease within 24 hours.
**361-723+ minutes**: Subjects no longer incapable of leaving the influence of SCP-472, though most do not realize this unless prompted. Previous emotional and hallucinatory effects vary in degree of intensity and become sporadic, alternating with periods of lucidity indefinitely until subject leaves or is removed from the area. Effects cease within 24 hours of vacating area.

When no subjects have been exposed to SCP-472 for more than five (5) minutes within in a period of two (2) months, its area of influence begins increasing by a rate of 0.5 m (1.6 ft) per day. Expansion is temporary, reverting back to the original 18 m (60 ft) area of effect once a subject undergoes exposure.

SCP-472 was recovered from the mansion residence of [REDACTED], a wealthy man living in [REDACTED]. Foundation investigators were alerted by local reports of hauntings by domestic staff after [REDACTED] was hospitalized by a fall. Several days of investigating narrowed down the origin of the anomalous effects to SCP-472, which had been prominently displayed in [REDACTED]'s jewelry collection. Questioning revealed that [REDACTED] had believed the ruby to be 'haunted', but kept it in his collection due to its high value.
