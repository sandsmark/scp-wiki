title:Reviewers' Spotlight Archive
This archive displays all works that have been featured on the site’s front page as part of the Reviewers’ Spotlight, which acknowledges the time and effort spent by forum reviewers helping other authors develop and edit and their works for the mainsite. 

Each month, community members are encouraged to nominate forum reviewers who have been both particularly helpful and active. Members of the Forum Criticism Team will then discuss the nominations, and select four prominent reviewers to choose the month’s Reviewers’ Spotlight front-page features. 

Nominations and recommendations and should be sent via wikidot message to [[*user Zyn]] (team captain of Forum Crit).
