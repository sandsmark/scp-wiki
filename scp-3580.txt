**Item #:** SCP-3580

**Object Class:** Safe[[footnote]]Due to the unpredictability of SCP-3580-2, subjects are to be treated as Euclid level.[[/footnote]]

**Special Containment Procedures:** Each of SCP-3580's five components are to be held within a humidity controlled padded lock box. At the time of writing, only SCP-3580-a in conjunction with SCP-3580-d have demonstrated anomalous properties. However, the complete set is to be contained in the event that unprecedented interactions manifest. In order to prevent unintended contact between the aforementioned items, SCP-3580-a through SCP-3580-d are to be kept within individual cotton pouches. SCP-3580-e is to be held within a fitted 6x10cm glass frame. 

In accordance with L-4 Standard Antique Preservation Procedures, relative humidity levels should not be permitted to exceed 1%. SCP-3580-a through SCP-3580-d are to be inspected annually for signs of oxidation, and cleaned if necessary.

Documented permission from the Head of On-Site Research is required if any containment protocols are to be disturbed or otherwise altered for study of SCP-3580. In order to prevent unnecessary damage to the heirloom, personnel hands must be washed and placed within standard disposable gloves prior to contact. The antiques remain fragile, and are to be handled with care.

All occurrences of SCP-3580-2 are to be contained within a sealed 64 m^^2^^ room. Furnishings standard with that of a middle income living area are required upon request. As per subject desire, the cell's interior may be remodeled assuming that said changes do not compromise containment, subject safety, nor the ability for staff personnel to gain access to SCP-3580-2 at any given time. 

Mandatory weekly psychological evaluations on SCP-3580-2 are to be performed by a trained psychiatrist. As per subject request, counselling sessions and a means in which to contact their assigned psychiatrist at any time may also be provided. On a case to case basis and alongside psychiatrist recommendation, SCP-3580-2 may be permitted to keep a small animal companion of their choice.

**Description:** SCP-3580 is composed of a set of gilded jewelry consistent with traditional Chinese betrothal wear. Each piece of the set contains an evident flower motif, and displays near-perfect condition.

**Affliction 2.a:**
Upon physical exposure to SCP-3580-e while contained within SCP-3580-a, subject [hereafter referred to as SCP-3580-2] demonstrates no immediate adverse effects. After an indeterminate amount of time, subject will grow increasing despondent and withdrawn. As time progresses SCP-3580-2 will develop pervasive hypercritical delusions regarding human physical appearance indicative of [DATA EXPUNGED].  

All instances of SCP-3580-2 express mild to extreme distress when confronted with their own physical appearance. Attempts are frequently made to either hide or correct one's perceived flaws. Methods noted include drastic bodily dissimulation, to excessive use of cosmetic surgery[[footnote]]The use of cosmetic surgery has been consistently shown to worsen subject's mental stability. [[/footnote]]. SCP-3580-2 will frequently seek the reassurance of others to deny that any notable change has taken place. Self-mutilation has been observed in late stage psychosis.

SCP-3580-2 will also express mild to extreme distress when confronted with the physical appearance of others [[footnote]]All cases of SCP-3580-2 are known to exhibit this symptom. Many may not express it, or express it non-verbally due to personal variability in empathy and taught etiquette. [[/footnote]]. SCP-3580-2 will often terminate both romantic and platonic relationships. When forced to converse with or view another human, all subjects have been noted to close eyes or avoid visual contact with the individual. Several display immediate urges to terminate interaction through physical or verbal means. If this fails, SCP-3580-2 has been noted to dissociate from reality, and/or grow violent. 

Behavior demonstrated by SCP-3580-2 includes an acute fixation on commonly viewed physiological regions such as the nose, stomach, thighs, skin, and hair. Incidences expand to include height, lip shape/size, shoulder width, proportional limb distribution, and muscle size. This degradation worsens proportionately as time passes, eventually encompassing SCP-3580-2's viewpoint of all visible features of themselves and others. No instances of SCP-3580-2 have manifested a genuine post-exposure alteration of appearance.

Extreme methods of establishing and maintaining self isolation have been noted. SCP-3580-2 are at a heightened risk for anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation/attempt. The application of amnestics to remove memory of encounter with SCP-3580-a and SCP-3580-e demonstrate no observable effects on psychosis.

**Addendum 3580-1:** //[01/18/201█]// As ordered by Dr. ███ ████, all components associated with SCP-3580 underwent a detailed chemical composition analysis.

> Note: Results indicative of wear, but no anomalous properties were detected. The gilding appears to have been performed utilizing 24 carat gold leaf (99.79% purity). The main body of each item consists of carved //Pinus armandii// wood, indigenous to China. SCP-3580-a exists as a notable exception. Its main body appears to have been constructed utilizing //Pinus resinosa//, which remains native to exclusively North America.

**Addendum 3580-2:** //[01/21/201█]// As a result of previous testing, a second specialized examination of SCP-3580-a was performed as ordered by Dr. ███ ████.

> Note: Carbon dating of the main body indicates an age of 150 ± ██ years. Additionally, SCP-3580-a's angular design indicates that it had been crafted in Victorian era style. This remains highly inconsistent with the remainder of the set. Results indicative of [DATA EXPUNGED].

**Addendum 3580-3:** //[02/04/201█]// Autopsy report of Agent L███ ██. Subject unknowingly came under the effects of Affliction 2.a during initial containment, and was hospitalized three weeks later as a result of life threatening self-mutilation. Subject's body was confiscated and brought to Site 1█. All attending medical professionals were administered Class-A amnestics.

__**Post-Morterm Report L:45-2 - [02/03/201█]**__
> **Name, Age, and Marital Status:** Agent L███ ██/24/Single                                               
> **Address:** [REDACTED]                                                    
> **P.M Authorized By:** Dr. ███ ████                                
> **Place of P.M:** Site 1█ Medical Ward, Wing: N2, Rm: 04  
> **Operating Physician:** Dr. █ █████                              
> **P.M Attendees:** Dr. ███ ████, Field Agent ███ ██
> **Time and Date of Death:** 4:54am, [02/02/201█]
> **Time and Date of P.M:** 6:13pm, [02/02/201█]
> **External Examination:** Remains presented in a black body bag. Subject wearing black cotton hooded sweatshirt and navy blue pants.
>  
> The body is that of an athletic caucasian male, measuring 172cm and weighing 82kg. Hair is brown in colour and approximately 5cm at longest point. The body is cold and unembalmed. Lividity is fixed in the inferior limbs. The eyes and surrounding skin including portions of the scalp from the occipital bone to either parietal ridge had been removed prior to death [hereafter referred to as Aberration A]. 
> 
> Removal of clothes reveals recent chemical burn damage to all regions of external skin below the shoulders [hereafter referred to as Aberration B]. Accumulation of necrotic tissues and fibrinopurulent material lining the chest and back. Distal limbs present hardened gray flesh. Damage to subcutaneous tissue evident. The presence of infection and dried exudate indicate healing. Aberration B was likely created approximately two weeks prior to death.
> 
> **Head/Central Nervous System:** Subsequent autopsy shows severe comminuted fracturing as a result of Aberration A in the parietal, frontal, nasal, temporal, ethmoid, and lacrimal bones. Additional fracturing can be seen within the zygomatic arch. Lacerations from Aberration A penetrate the skin and subdermal tissues of the head and neck. Tearing of the dura, arachnoid, and pia mater is evident. Abnormal quantities of blood can be found within the subarachnoid space, in addition to mild bruising on the frontal and parietal lobes of the brain.
>  
> **Skeletal System:** See above. All other structures appear intact.
> 
> **Respiratory System/Throat Structures:** The mucosa displays several large lesions resulting from excessive irritation via the teeth. Otherwise, there are no injuries to the lips, teeth or gums.
> 
> There is no obstruction of the airway. Mucosa of the epiglottis, glottis, piriform sinuses, trachea and major bronchi appear irritated, likely from chemical inhilation.
> 
> The right and left lungs weigh 365g and 366g respectively. The lungs are unremarkable.
> 
> **Cardiovascular System:** The heart weighs 318g, and has a normal size and configuration. 
> 
> **Gastrointestinal System:** The mucosa and wall of the esophagus are irritated but without lesions. The gastric mucosa is without injury. Approximately ███ ml of partially digested [REDACTED] is found in the stomach. The mucosa of the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and colon are intact. Rectum appears scarred by Aberration B.
> 
> **Urinary System:** The right and left kidneys weigh 125g and 131g. The kidneys are unremarkable.
> 
> **Male Genital System:** Effects of Aberration B are present on all exposed genitalia. Based on evidence provided by subdurmal tissue analysis, a vasectomy appears to have been performed approximately two weeks prior to death. All remaining structures appear intact.
> 
> **Toxicology:** A sample of blood and bile are submitted for toxicologic analysis.
> 
> **Cause of Death:** Subarachnoid hemorrhaging resulting from Aberration A. Aberration B is estimated to have occurred two weeks prior to death.
> 
> **Closing Remarks:** Subject was originally presented as a homicide victim due to the violent nature of the structural damage to the cranium. Presence of Aberration B indicates this possibility to be highly unlikely. Given Agent L███ ██'s assignment as a member of SCP-3580's retrieval team (and the reported nature of SCP-3580) an unreported breach in containment is likely at fault.

> 
> **Agent M███ ███:** [Slowly and disconnectedly.] "I think that I would like to return to my quarters now, doc." [Subject lapses into silence and no further attempts to generate a response were successful.]
> 
> **<End Log>**
> 
> **Closing Statement:** Subject was returned to containment without incident. Subject's negative reaction to physical contact indicates an alteration to additional senses beyond sight. Further testing is required.
