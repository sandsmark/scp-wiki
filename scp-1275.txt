**Item #:** SCP-1275

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1275 is contained at Containment Area 43, located in the Gobi Desert. The object is to be contained within a 750 cm tungsten cube, containing an electrified tungsten wire grid, the remaining space being filled with lead maintained at 1200° centigrade. The primary containment chamber is to be blast rated for pressures up to 200 kPa, with a secondary external chamber rated for up to 1500 kPa. Three blast shielded monitoring stations each positioned 10km away are to be kept staffed and on alert at all times.

The object is to be constantly monitored via sonar, video feed, and the experimental Salzmann device. Any notable changes in object size or behavior to be immediately reported to the Head Researcher and Security Department to prepare for recontainment as needed, and/or to combat any hostile forces, entities, or objects that may appear. In the case of a full containment breach, a perimeter is to be established and a 30km radius is to be monitored via motion sensor to speed re-containment. 

Task forces assigned to recontainment of SCP-1275 are to approach with the greatest caution, and to take defensive measures at any sign of an emergence. Under no circumstances may personnel approach within 30m of SCP-1275 if it is loose, recontainment will be accomplished via specialized capture netting, delivered by air. Personnel in the process of being enveloped by SCP-1275 should be terminated if possible unless authorized by Level 4 personnel.

**Description:** SCP-1275 is a fluid amorphous entity of variable volume, shape, color, and opacity. Observed volumes of material composing the entity have ranged from ~1 cm³ minimum to a maximum of ~30 m³. The entity seems not to exist fully within the material world. It is affected by gravity and cannot pass through solid materials, yet registers no weight on instruments regardless of its current size. Parts separated from the main body appear to flow extradimensionally back to it, making sample tests unfeasible. It is not chemically reactive, shows no changes with variations in temperature, is not electrically conductive, and returns no tactile sensation.

The entity is capable of forming itself into any shape, including flattening to ~.01mm thickness(minimum observed), spooling into a threaded form, or taking on the shape, color, and opacity of similar objects around it. It appears to be intelligent and/or controlled by an outside intelligence, as it tends to attempt to envelop objects of value, SCP artifacts or personnel in particular. Upon enveloping an object the entity will turn opaque, rapidly decrease in size, and the object enveloped will vanish to parts unknown. 

Objects and personnel taken were originally believed to be consumed, digested, and converted into energy. However, evidence now suggests that the entity has an end point in another part of the world that it is connected to extradimensionally, and that it shifts portions of itself between these endpoints, accounting for its apparent fluctuations in volume. The entity appears unable to remove the endpoint held by the foundation. It is theorized that either this is the primary half of the entity, or that it naturally has a divided existence.

It has proven capable of breaching all but the most stringent of security measures, pressing its way through seals thought to be air and/or water tight, moving through air ducts, electrical systems, under carpet or tile, or tunneling through loose material such as dirt or sand. It attempts to avoid observation by blending in with its surroundings and remaining motionless. If noticed, it will move quickly and attempt to envelop personnel before they can raise an alarm.

**Recovery Log SCP-1275:**

SCP-1275 was first contained on August 15, 2003, as it attempted to breach the security of Site-76. Still frame analysis systems monitoring camera feeds outside SCP-███'s containment chamber found irregularities between frames and proceeded to initiate a lockdown of the area. Containment attempts resulted in the loss of ten security personnel and two agents before the entity could be brought under control.

SCP-1275 attempts to infiltrate facilities, locate objects or personnel deemed to be of value, and envelop them, presumably transporting them to its other endpoint. Investigation has proven it to be responsible for the previously unexplained loss of SCP-███, SCP-███, SCP-████, SCP-████, SCP-████, and SCP-████. It is suspected in the disappearance/theft of seventeen other objects and entities from ten different facilities over a span of eighteen years, and the known loss of forty-nine personnel to date.

Attempts to intentionally send equipment back through SCP-1275 have failed; objects the entity does not wish to transport remain even if forcibly inserted. Evidence strongly suggests that the entity sides with or is controlled by the hostile agents, and that they are attempting to retrieve it. Due to the potential for further theft of SCP artifacts and personnel, this is to be prevented by any means necessary. To date too little data has been recovered to establish a definite link to any individual group. Research attempts are to be targeted at establishing a direct connection, for the retrieval of lost artifacts and personnel if possible.

**Incident Log SCP-1275:**

After capture, the entity actively attempted to breach containment for the next eight months through its normal methods with varying levels of success, causing loss of personnel and equipment. Initial containment procedures were developed at this time. After this it went inactive for a period of four months. The entity then began rapidly disgorging high energy explosives in all directions, causing serious damage to the facility, though apparently none to itself. It renewed its attempts at containment breach, all of which were prevented. Entity was moved to a new facility and put into a stronger containment cell. 

Two months later, further explosives were disgorged, followed by visual surveillance equipment, transmitters, and paranormal objects(now classified as SCP-████ and SCP-████) harmful to personnel on-site and containment cell walls. Serious damage was caused to the containment facility and staff. An unknown hostile retrieval team was intercepted attempting to reach SCP-1275's location, but escaped without casualties. Internal breach efforts resulted in the loss of 21 personnel before containment could be fully re-established. Containment site was moved again and further countermeasures were put into play. 

Five months later, enemy agents armed with paranormal weaponry emerged from within SCP-1275, and rapidly attempted to set up a base of operations within the containment cell. Hostilities began, containment was breached. Mobile Task Forces were sent in to engage and recover the object, and the enemy agents were driven back into SCP-1275 again. Containment was re-established at its present location with the current procedures. The mesh grid has prevented SCP-1275 from disgorging objects capable of breaching its containment, and the lead has thus far prevented transmitters from signaling its location to enemy agents.
