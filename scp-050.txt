**Item #:** SCP-050

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** So far, all attempts to contain SCP-050 have proven fruitless[[footnote]]Testing to contain SCP-050 has been discontinued at this time.[[/footnote]]. At present, whoever has possession of SCP-050 is to leave it in an office they use with regularity[[footnote]]Attempts to leave SCP-050 in unused offices have resulted in it following its owner home. This is a violation of regulations and not to be allowed.[[/footnote]].

**Description:** SCP-050 appears to be a statue of a monkey reading a book, approximately 1 foot[[footnote]]One of the quirks of SCP-050 is that no matter what form of measurement is used, any record of said measurements will quickly be replaced by the Customary System measurements.[[/footnote]] tall. On the bottom of the statue are engraved the words "To The Cleverest" in cursive script.

The statue has so far proven resistant to all forms of damage[[footnote]]Attempts to damage SCP-050 have resulted in increasingly lethal 'pranks.' As of this writing, destruction testing is discontinued.[[/footnote]]. As such, there is no accurate method to date the object.

When left alone, SCP-050 has shown itself to be both useful and antagonistic to its current owner[[footnote]]See [[[Document 050]]].[[/footnote]]. Although never seen to move, no matter the manner or amount of recordings, any room it is left in becomes very clean, to a polish whenever possible. Paperwork is filed, trash is emptied, and in general, clutter is removed. However, SCP-050 also has a tendency to leave traps for its owner, so current holders should carefully check their offices upon returning.
