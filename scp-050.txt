    **Item #:** SCP-050

    **Object Class:** Euclid

    **Special Containment Procedures:** So far, all attempts to contain SCP-050 have proven fruitless^^1^^. At present, whoever has possession of SCP-050 is to leave it in an office they use with regularity^^2^^.

    **Description:** SCP-050 appears to be a statue of a monkey reading a book, approximately one foot^^3^^ tall. On the bottom of the statue are engraved the words "To The Cleverest" in cursive script.

The statue has so far proven resistant to all forms of damage^^4^^. As such, there is no accurate method to date the object.

When left alone, SCP-050 has proven to be a mixed blessing to its current owner^^5^^. Although never seen to move, no matter the manner or amount of recordings, any room it is left in becomes very clean, to a polish whenever possible. Paperwork is filed, trash is emptied, and in general, clutter is removed. However, SCP-050 also seems to take a perverse thrill in leaving traps for its owner, little pranks that are not discovered until too late.
----

^^1^^: Testing to contain SCP-050 has been discontinued at this time.
^^2^^: Attempts to leave SCP-050 in unused offices have resulted in it following its owner home. This is a violation of regulations and not to be allowed.
^^3^^: One of the quirks of SCP-050 is that no matter what form of measurement is used, any record of said measurements will quickly be replaced by the Customary System measurements.
^^4^^: Attempts to damage SCP-050 have resulted in increasingly lethal 'pranks.' As of this writing, destruction testing is discontinued.
^^5^^: See [[[Document 050]]].
