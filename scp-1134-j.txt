**Item #:** SCP-1134-J

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1134-J is to be kept in a locked drawer in Doctor ████’s office. No further containment measures are deemed necessary to contain SCP-1134-J.

**Description:** SCP-1134-J is a roll of tan masking tape, approximately 4 cm in width. The labels on the interior of the roll suggest that is --the bad kind-- manufactured by ██.

 SCP-1134-J’s anomalous properties are manifested when a human subject, henceforth referred to as SCP-1134-J-A, attempts to tear off a piece of SCP-1134-J. Instances of SCP-1134-J-A seem to be opposed to using scissors or any kind of a blade when attempting to remove a piece of SCP-1134-J.

When SCP-1134-J-A removes a piece of SCP-1134-J, SCP-1134-J will tear at a point that SCP-1134-J-A did not intend, regardless of how much care was invested in doing so. This causes an unusually large amount of frustration in SCP-1134-J-A, often causing SCP-1134-J-A to attack SCP-1134-J. SCP-1134-J also seems to be impervious to all attempts to damage it by SCP-1134-J-A, and attempts to do so also seem to cause additional frustration in SCP-1134-J-A.

> 
> //D-23867 is removed from the testing area. The subject appears to be extremely frustrated, however returns to an ordinary psychological state after 14 hours. Post-test examination of SCP-1134-J showed that no damage was inflicted on SCP-1134-J.//
> 
> **Analysis:** //SCP-1134-J seems to cause extreme frustration in those attempting to remove a piece from it. Further experiments are required to find the extent of SCP-1134-J’s “unrippablity”.//

> **Subject:** D-49856
> 
> **Procedure:** D-49856 is placed in a standard humanoid containment chamber, outfitted with a one-way mirror for viewing by Doctor ████. Also within the chamber is SCP-1134-J, placed on floor of the containment chamber, and a standard pair of scissors.

> **Doctor ████:** Please remove a rectangular piece of SCP-1134-J.

> //D-49856 complies, and similar to the previous test, SCP-1134-J tears diagonally, causing frustration in D-49856.//
> 
> **D-49856:** [EXPLETIVE]!
> 
> //D-49856 attempts again to remove a piece from SCP-1134-J, without being instructed to do so. This attempt is once again met with failure, as a tear forms that is approximately 12 cm long, along one edge of SCP-1134-J.//

> 
> **Doctor ████:** D-49856, please try to stay calm. Use the scissors we have supplied you to cut a rectangular piece of SCP-1134-J.
> 
> **D-49856:** OH, [EXPLETIVE] THAT! If I can’t rip a [EXPLETIVE] [EXPLETIVE] piece of tape, then what the [EXPLETIVE] am I [EXPLETIVE] good for?
> 
> //D-49856 kicks the supplied pair of scissors to the far corner of the testing chamber, and once again attempts to tear a piece off of SCP-1134-J. The tear previously made grew an additional 14 cm as this piece was torn off, causing D-49856 to become extremely agitated and angry.//
> 
> **D-49856:** [EXPLETIVE] [EXPLETIVE] [EXPLETIVE]! [EXPLETIVE] PIECE OF [EXPLETIVE]!
> 
> //D-49856 attempts to rip SCP-1134-J into two pieces. After 12 seconds of attempting to pull SCP-1134-J apart, D-49856 holds SCP-1134-J to the wall of the testing chamber, and repeatedly strikes SCP-1134-J. Post-test examination showed that none of these measures seemed to have an effect on the structural integrity of SCP-1134-J.//

> 
> **D-49856:** [EXPLETIVE] off! I’m [EXPLETIVE] trying to… AAAH! Stop it! 
> 
> //After 8 minutes, and statements from D-49856 was “cooled off” D-49856 attempts with her hands to remove a piece of SCP-1134-J. SCP-1134-J tears at a slight angle, but this seems to cause only minor annoyance with D-49856. She attempts again, slowly, to remove a piece of SCP-1134-J. However it tears in the middle, separating SCP-1134-J into two halves. This causes D-49856 to once again attack SCP-1134-J, this time striking it repeatedly with her head. Several other D-class personnel enter the test chamber to intervene. D-49856 grabs one of the D-class’s firearms and repeatedly shoots SCP-1134-J at a range of approximately 1.4 meters. Of the 7 shots fired at SCP-1134-J, 5 are direct hits on SCP-1134-J. The D-class then forcefully grab D-49856, and remove her from the testing chamber.//

> 
> //D-49856 is placed into temporary containment for psychological evaluation. 5 hours after being removed from the testing chamber, D-49856 seems to have returned to an ordinary psychological state. The 5 hits on SCP-1134-J seem to have had no effect.//
> 
> **Analysis:** //SCP-1134-J-A seems to choose against using scissors when cutting SCP-1134-J. SCP-1134-J-A is confirmed to have an emotional response to SCP-1134-J. Also, SCP-1134-J is extremely resistant to damage. Further testing is required to see how indestructible SCP-1134-J is.//

__**Test SCP-1134-J-3**__
> **Subject:** D-99214
> 
> **Procedure:** D-99214 is placed in a reinforced humanoid containment chamber, outfitted with several reinforcing steel plates lining the chamber. Also within the chamber is an of SCP-1134-J, placed on floor of the containment chamber, several aluminum bats, axes, handguns, rifles, knives, and hand grenades.

> **D-99214:** Um, okay.

> 
> **D-99214:** [EXPLETIVE]! How did it do that? 
> 
> //D-99214 is visibly frustrated, and once again hits SCP-1134-J with the selected axe, again with no effect. D-99214 then changes weapons to an AK-47 assault rifle, and opens fire on SCP-1134-J. Due to the angle of cameras in the testing chamber, no shots are confirmed hits on SCP-1134-J, but post-test analysis of audio showed that 37 shots were fired. Again, no damage is visible on SCP-1134-J.//

> **D-99214:** [EXPLETIVE] [EXPLETIVE] PIECE OF [EXPLETIVE] [EXPLETIVE]! WHAT A LOAD OF [EXPLETIVE]! I’M [EXPLETIVE] DONE WITH [EXPLETIVE] THIS PIECE OF [EXPLETIVE]!
> 
> //D-99214 throws the previously selected AK-47 at SCP-1134-J, striking it directly. Then, D-99214 selects a hand grenade from the available arsenal and throws it at SCP-1134-J. It detonates 0.6 meters from SCP-1134-J, and sends it towards the far wall of the chamber. D-99214 is unharmed, and then proceeds to attack SCP-1134-J with a knife provided. With every strike on SCP-1134-J, D-99214 grows more frustrated and angry.//

D-99214 is declared deceased by sudden cardiac arrest upon removal from the testing chamber, and is then removed from the site. Post-test examination revealed no damage on the surface of SCP-1134-J//
> 
>  **Analysis:** None of the aforementioned  tools/weapons seem to have an effect on the structural integrity of SCP-1134-J.
