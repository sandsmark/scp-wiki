> **Dr. Mills:** Morning, Jeff.
> 
> **Dr. Hollander:** Ah, good morning.  Go ahead have a seat.
> 
> **Dr. Mills:** Don't mind if I do.
> 
> //Dr. Mills proceeds to sit down in the chair adjacent to Dr. Hollander.//
> 
> **Dr. Hollander:** Whoa, hey!  Watch it.  You were about to sit on Lurk.
> 
> **Dr. Mills:** Lur...what is a Lurk?
> 
> **Dr. Hollander:** Ha, good one.  
> 
> **Dr. Mills:** No, I'm serious.
> 
> **Dr. Hollander:** C'mon, Greg.  You guys have been introduced haven't you?
> 
> //Dr. Hollander motions to his left.//
> 
> **Dr. Mills:** [chuckles] OK, what is this?
> 
> **Dr. Hollander:** This is Lurk D.  He's been working in our department for almost three months now, Greg.
> 
> **Dr. Mills:** Alright alright alright, I got it, you can stop.
> 
> **Dr. Hollander:** Stop what?
> 
> **Dr. Mills:** This...whatever this thing you are doing is.
> 
> **Dr. Hollander:** Huh?  What was that?
> 
> //Dr. Hollander leans to his left side.//
> 
> **Dr. Hollander:** No, I don't think you've been on assignment that long.
> 
> **Dr. Mills:** Who are you talking to, Jeff.

> **Dr. Mills:** Africa?  Really?  From Africa?
> 
> **Dr. Hollander:** [whispers] You're kinda sounding like a racist, Greg.
> 
> **Dr. Mills:**  Racist!?!
> 
> **Dr. Hollander:** Uh, hold on, Greg.  What was that?
> 
> //Dr. Hollander again leans to his left side.//

> 
> **Dr. Hollander:** No, I don't think that, Lurk.

> 
> **Dr. Mills:** [scoffs] Oh c'mon!  That desk has been vacant for months.

> **Dr. Hollander:** It hasn't been that long.  Lurk was only out on assignment for two weeks.  Huh?  What was that?  Oh, right...more like two and a half weeks.
> 
> **Dr. Mills:** Well what about...that?  How come he can only speak through you?
> 
> **Dr. Hollander:** Lurk has the laryngitis that's been going around.  Don't you hear how hoarse he is?
