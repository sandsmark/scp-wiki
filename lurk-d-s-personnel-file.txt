> 
> **Dr. Mills:** Don't mind if I do.
> 
> //Dr. Mills proceeds to sit down in the chair adjacent to Dr. Hollander.//
> 
> **Dr. Hollander:** Whoa, hey!  Watch it.  You were about to sit on Lurk.
> 
> **Dr. Mills:** Lur...what is a Lurk?
> 
> **Dr. Hollander:** Ha, good one.  
> 
> **Dr. Mills:** No, I'm serious.
> 
> **Dr. Hollander:** C'mon, Greg.  You guys have been introduced haven't you?
> 
> //Dr. Hollander motions to his left.//
> 
> **Dr. Mills:** [chuckles] OK, what is this?
> 
> **Dr. Hollander:** This is Lurk D.  He's been working in our department for almost three months now, Greg.
> 
> **Dr. Mills:** Alright alright alright, I got it, you can stop.
> 
> **Dr. Hollander:** Stop what?
> 
> **Dr. Mills:** This...whatever this thing you are doing is.
> 
> **Dr. Hollander:** Huh?  What was that?
