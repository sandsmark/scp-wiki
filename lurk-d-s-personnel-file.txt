> 
> //Dr. Jeffery Hollander is sitting at a table in the far corner of the lounge.  Dr. Hollander is seen laughing just as Dr. Gregory Mills enters the lounge.//    
> 
> **Dr. Mills:** Morning, Jeff.
> 
> **Dr. Hollander:** Ah, good morning.  Go ahead have a seat.
> 
> **Dr. Mills:** Don't mind if I do.
> 
> //Dr. Mills proceeds to sit down in the chair adjacent to Dr. Hollander.//
> 
> **Dr. Hollander:** Whoa, hey!  Watch it.  You were about to sit on Lurk.
> 
> **Dr. Mills:** Lur...what is a Lurk?
> 
> **Dr. Hollander:** Ha, good one.  
> 
> **Dr. Mills:** No, I'm serious.
> 
> **Dr. Hollander:** C'mon, Greg.  You guys have been introduced haven't you?
> 
> //Dr. Hollander motions to his left.//
> 
> **Dr. Mills:** [chuckles] OK, what is this?
> 
> **Dr. Hollander:** This is Lurk D.  He's been working in our department for almost three months now, Greg.
> 
> **Dr. Mills:** Alright alright alright, I got it, you can stop.
> 
> **Dr. Hollander:** Stop what?
> 
> **Dr. Mills:** This...whatever this thing you are doing is.
> 
> **Dr. Hollander:** Huh?  What was that?
> 
> //Dr. Hollander leans to his left side.//
> 
> **Dr. Hollander:** No, I don't think you've been on assignment that long.
> 
> **Dr. Mills:** Who are you talking to, Jeff.
> 
> **Dr. Hollander:** I'm talking to Lurk.
> 
> **Dr. Mills:** Wha!  Eh...what kind of name is Lurk D anyway...I mean...[scoffs]....really?
> 
> **Dr. Hollander:** I don't know, I think he's originally from Africa?
> 
> **Dr. Mills:** Africa?  Really?  From Africa?
> 
> **Dr. Hollander:** [whispers] You're kinda sounding like a racist, Greg.
> 
> **Dr. Mills:**  Racist!?!
> 
> **Dr. Hollander:** Uh, hold on, Greg.  What was that?
> 
> //Dr. Hollander again leans to his left side.//
> 
> **Dr. Mills:** Oh my God!
> 
> **Dr. Hollander:** No, I don't think that, Lurk.
> 
> **Dr. Mills:** Wait, wait, wait...Lurk...I...I got a memo last week written by a Lurk D.
> 
> **Dr. Hollander:** Oh yeah.  Lurk was asking me if you got a chance to read it yet.
> 
> **Dr. Mills:** Are you serious right now?  It was sent through your email, Jeff!
> 
> **Dr. Hollander:** Hmm, you sure it wasn't forwarded?
> 
> **Dr. Mills:** Forwarded!?!  Can you hear yourself right now?  No, seriously...do you know how insane you sound like at the moment?
> 
> **Dr. Hollander:** Greg, are you OK?
> 
> **Dr. Mills:** OK, listen...if this Lurk D works here...where is his desk?
> 
> **Dr. Hollander:** He's been working in the bullpen...over there.
> 
> //Dr. Hollander points to a desk just outside of the lounge.//
> 
> **Dr. Mills:** [scoffs] Oh c'mon!  That desk has been vacant for months.
> 
> **Dr. Hollander:** It hasn't been that long.  Lurk was only out on assignment for two weeks.  Huh?  What was that?  Oh, right...more like two and a half weeks.
> 
> **Dr. Mills:** Well what about...that?  How come he can only speak through you?
> 
> **Dr. Hollander:** Lurk has the laryngitis that's been going around.  Don't you hear how hoarse he is?
> 
> //Fred Carlyle, Facility Superintendent enters the lounge.//
> 
> **Dr. Hollander:** Good morning, sir.
> 
> **Dr. Mills:** [sigh] Morning, sir.
> 
> **Supt. Carlyle:** Ah, good morning, Jeff...Greg...Lurk.
> 
> **Dr. Mills:** AHHHHHH!  WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE!?!  DID EVERYONE EAT A BIG PLATE OF CRAZY THIS MORNING!?!  JESUS FUCK!
> 
> //Dr. Mills briskly exits the lounge while mumbling to himself.//  
> 
> **ADENNDUM:** Dr. Mills was later reprimanded for his outburst and was transferred to another facility.  Lurk D has graciously decided not to pursue the incident further.[[/collapsible]]

**-11 Dec 2012-**
Finally landed a desk job.  All that field work was starting to wear me out.  Got my first assignment on my first day too.  Apparently the higher ups are reopening the file on SCP-1262.  Don't really know why.  The black box from that passenger plane involved arrived too with explicit instructions not to open the casing until a specialist arrives from another assignment.  Even if I wanted to, I wouldn't be able to figure out how to open it up in the first place.  Oh well, it makes a nice paper weight in the mean time.   I hope they tested this thing for contaminants before sending it to me.

**-17 Jan 2013-**
Talked to my buddy Hollander today.  I never knew he was the investigator for SCP-1264.  Most of the stuff he couldn't divulge, but still...very interesting.  He even kept the helmet from SCP-1264-A-1.  He was supposed to dispose of it after the autopsy, but I guess nobody noticed.  Hell, its been over 10 years!  I doubt anyone will come looking for it.  Anyhow, Hollander was nice enough to let me have it as an early b-day gift.  It looks great on top of my file cabinet. 

**-8 Feb 2013-**
A little groggy today.  Just got back from assignment on SCP-1472.  It just happened to land on my b-day as well.  I don't know how Geoff got clearance for us to "investigate".  Needless to say, that SD card will never see the light of day... EVER!

**-13 Feb 2013-**
I don't understand this inside joke about personnel not being able to see or hear me.  It's really getting obnoxious.

**-22 Feb 2013-**
Well, turns out that the Foundation finally got wind of SCP-1471.  I was asked to estimate the number of exposed civilians and those civilians with permanent symptoms.  My initial findings don't look too hopeful.  I'm a bit apprehensive to show this to the superintendent right now because it looks like nearly 70% of those exposed wind up with permanent symptoms.  I probably need to bounce this off the statisticians in Lab 7, due date is not till Thursday anyway.  

I probably shouldn't mention my own symptoms.  I swear I can almost feel it looking over my shoulder as I write this.  I almost don't mind though...it does make good company.  Decided to call it "Ingram" after the name of the gun I keep hidden in my drawer.

**-28 Feb 2013-**
I needed to get some privacy so I had my desk and belongings moved to a new location...right next to the aquarium containment tanks.  It's an odd place to work I know but I enjoy the quietness of it all.  Nobody ever comes into this area since all the systems are automated.  That little cramped office was really bugging me and the superintendent didn't seem to mind granting my request.  So my desk is now positioned with my back to the observational portal of Containment Aquarium Tank-3 where I can relax and watch SCP-1340 swim if I feel like it.  I can even catch Ingram's reflection in the glass if I look behind me...always an open ear whenever I need to vent.  Honestly it's very soothing here.

**-5 Mar 2013-**
My boss just told me that he was called into the field recently.  Extremely irregular, especially since the man is Level-3 and has not been in the field in over a decade.  I guess the Foundation was in a pinch for an experienced field interrogator and apparently he was the closest one who wasn't on assignment.  After his story about SCP-1393, he gave me a business card he received; then asked if we had any "anomalous communication devices" that could call the number on the card.  He said something about wanting to file a complaint with someone.  I told him I'd look into it.

**-16 Mar 2013-**
Just got back from assignment in Java.  I thought I was done with this crap field work...apparently not.  I'm nearly anemic from all of the mosquito bites.  The actual assignment was not much better.  Had to supervise over a geological evaluation on some dormant volcano related to SCP-1503.  There was almost nothing to report.  I caught a glimpse of it from the other side of its fence.  It still looks like it is trying to run downhill.  After reading the translations from the linguistics department, I am not entirely sure if it is talking about the eruption that has happened or an eruption that will happen.  The volcano is certainly overdue.  

**-21 Mar 2013-**
The latest buzz around the office is about this memo sent by O5.  The gist of the memo is that it states that SCP-1505 is growing out of hand and that everyone needs to do their part until its resolved... which basically means that everyone is now required to shoot at specimens of SCP-1505 whenever they see one.  There is even a little gambling pool amongst some people about who can kill the most by the end of the month.  I keep seeing more and more of them by the day.  I even got a chance to shoot at one while I was eating lunch in the break room.  It was there just perched on the chain link fence and I nailed it with my Springfield 1911 from the window.  I clipped its wing and it fell off its perch.  

I had a funny feeling that this wasn't a specimen, so I took it inside for further observation.  Sure enough, it was a genuine raven alright... probably the last wild one from what I've been told.  The onsite vet had to amputate its wing.  Terrible luck.  I requested to be assigned to its care and now it stays with me near my desk, being flightless and all.  It basically just stays perched on the coat rack all day long.  The bird looks fairly old, so I decided to call it Munroe after my grandfather.  It's funny, yesterday I could have sworn I saw Munroe cawing at Ingram's reflection.  I hope I don't regret saving this bird.  

**-5 Apr 2013-**
Glad I moved my office here over a month ago, my former lab offices are trashed.  Everyone is getting moved into my lab or Lab5.  Either way, must of my superiors are being real hush-hush about SCP-1598's containment breaches.  All I know (or permitted to know) is that it was once human.  There isn't even an acquisition report on it, which is extremely irregular.  I feel like old Herbert has something to do with it though.  Before he was killed he asked me to hang on to some of his test samples and store them in my personal freeze storage unit.  I still don't know what this stuff is, but I bet I am not supposed to have it.  I fear that I may get involved in something I don't want to be involved with if I turn them over.  It just one single label with the words "samsa-antidote-solution".
