**Item #:** SCP-3268

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** The computer SCP-3268 is currently residing in should be kept in Electronic Storage Facility-██. Any forms of digital messages sent out from it's current computer are to be traced, and the devices that have received the messages are to be seized and taken into foundation custody. Any devices that SCP-3268 currently resides in are to have no access to the internet any time.

One image of any organism of Kingdom of Animalia is to be uploaded to the hard drive of the computer at least once a day as a food source. Upon full image infection, it is to be deleted from the device. Any digital image format is acceptable.

It is very important to keep SCP-3268 in an overall satisfied state, as it has been shown to be able to transfer itself to new devices if it finds it's current one uninhabitable. Feeding times are never to be missed, and deletion of infected images is necessary.

**Description:** SCP-3268 is an anomalous entity that appears only on digital devices capable of displaying images, such as computers and phones. The exact form of SCP-3268 varies, but in most instances, it is a mass of many different colored pixels, and depending on it's position, a mouth may or may not be visible. SCP-3268 also varies heavily in size, usually depending on the device it is currently taking a residence in. The smallest recorded sighting being approximately 0.5 millimeters in diameter, and the largest being 5 meters in diameter. 

SCP-3268 is predatory, and feeds on digital images of organisms of the Kingdom Animalia. When an image of a potential prey item is uploaded to the device it is currently on, SCP-3268 will appear on the image, typically 2 hours after the initial upload. From there it will slowly begin to expand, and engulf the image until the entire image is comprised solely of many pixels of various colors. This process typically takes 5 hours. Around 30 minutes after the complete infestation, SCP-3268 will disappear, and the infected image will show a dead, mangled and partially eaten version of the organism originally in the photo. All organisms killed by SCP-3268 all appear to have broken necks, gouged eyes and many large bite marks in various areas. SCP-3268 will no longer manifest on a previously infected images, however any organisms on previously infected images will begin to show signs of decay, and should be removed to keep SCP-3268 in a satisfied state. 

If an organism that has had it's image infected by SCP-3268 is to be photographed after the infection, any newly taken images will display that organism as dead, and in the state of decay corresponding to the original photo. 

**SCP-3268 Recovery Log**

SCP-3268 was discovered in ██████, Florida on June 7th, ████ on a █████ computer in the home of Jonathan ██████. The owner reported to ██████, an internet help forum dedicated to the removal of computer viruses, that images of his cat had been infected with a virus that caused the cat to appear dead, and disemboweled. Embedded agents promptly launched an investigation, and seized the device. Amnestics were administered to Mr. ██████, and the forum that SCP-3268 was reported on was taken down.

**Addendum 3268-A**

Doctor █████ was observing a 2 day old infected image of an //Eudorcas thomsonii//, on SCP-3268's most recent housing device, a ██████ model ██ computer, when a single text file appeared on the desktop of the computer, titled 0I3UERYHDFNSKX.txt. Upon opening it, it contained the following message: "clean it. not happy. dead smell." The image was promptly deleted, and the text file was archived at Digital Archive Site ██.

It appears that SCP-3268 is capable of at least some communication, and is aware that someone is providing for it. Cause of this is unknown at the moment, further testing required.

__**Behavior Test - █-█-20██**__
> **Subject: SCP-3268
> **Procedure: No feeding or cleaning for 3 days
> **Results: SCP-3268 somehow enabled internet access on the computer it was residing in, and emailed itself to 86 different addresses. 
> **Analysis: SCP-3268 is capable of transferring itself to other devices if it is not happy with it's current housing. Upgrade to euclid status requested. This test is not to be repeated.
