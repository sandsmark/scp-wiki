> Far away from the light and sound of the city, a lone man on an island of steel and glass stands and looks through a great telescope. He wonders, wonders about the great many things that reside in the night sky, of the stars and space in between. He wonders about the great many things about which he used to wonder, about the falling stars and the sometimes-stars and the stars that were always moving. He wonders, watching as a small little speck of light shifts slightly, flickering out and reappearing in the blink of an eye. He had wondered once, as a child, why some of the great bright stars twinkled in the night sky. And now, he wonders again.

= Deep below the island of hard metal that floats heavily on the waves, a fallen star stirs in its slumber.

= Within the star, a people rises.

= And from without the star, a new life bursts forth.

[[[scp-169|SCP-169]]], the Leviathan, is a member of a species of gargantuan, space-dwelling arthropods. These creatures possess within them massive, empty chambers, brimming with the seeds of life: strange stones and vegetation, breathable air, and bio-luminescent lighting. The amount of chambers each creature has, and exactly how each looks, varies from member to member. However, once they reach the end of their life cycle, these creatures will beach themselves on planets, where life will slowly start to form within them and be released once the creature expires.

Our particular series, Genesis, covers the life of SCP-169 from the beginning of its life to its coming days. However, anybody is allowed to make their own series of tales within the Old Man in the Sea canon. Should you wish to add something to Genesis, please contact [[user Roget]] about doing so.

+ Elements of the Canon
There are many different aspects to the canon, each of which you can use and add to once your tale sticks. These elements include:

++ SCP-169 - "Levi"

SCP-169 is a wise, calm observer of the world around it. It doesn't know much about the world outside of the ocean, but it has seen many things within the depths, natural and otherwise. It likes to think of itself as one observing art move - as such, it thinks of life on Earth less as equal, intelligent creatures, but as living portraits. It does fear its death, and still has apprehensions about the requirements for giving 'birth' to its brood, although it ultimately tries to fool itself into being happy for them.

There are five of what were once cities connected within SCP-169, only two of which are named so far (Tentaboeoe and Hirakeroek). These five cities were, before the events of [[[As Time Draws Near]]], connected under the Teachings of Marzed, led by His Graciousness Diviner Artem at the Crown of Velvet. Their religion preached of one true creator who formed each of the five cities and its inhabitants from pieces of himself. There are two Teachings-based holyman levels identified thus far: 

* Diviners, those who preach the teachings of Marzed while seeking knowledge of the world around them.
* Castmen, low-level preachers and basic handymen for the church.

It is not known what is currently inhabiting the other cities within SCP-169, and whether or not they themselves are joined.

The first organization to attempt containment of SCP-169 was the American Secure Containment Initiative, which was not able to actually enact containment. However, they did make preparations for one day containing it, including creating alliances with European and American governments and building easier routes to the Leviathan's location (i.e the Panama Canal). The Initiative was absorbed by the Foundation in the middle of the twentieth century, and the resources with it.

The Foundation currently contains SCP-169 in much the same way as is specified in the object's containment procedure, albeit with some alterations. As a result of certain developments in the activity of the Leviathan (detailed in Genesis), the Foundation has assigned a permanent contingency of ships and other craft, including some purpose-built structures, to the organism. Within these ships they monitor and study both 169 and the various biological entities and other irregularities which it produces.
 
++ Other Leviathans

There are potentially thousands of other Leviathans out in the universe. It's not known how they're born, but it's known that large pods will live in relatively empty solar systems close to the star before departing for their ark-based purposes. There's many stories you could tell with another Leviathan, such as a species-based origin story or perhaps your own new series detailing the life of one in space or from birth to death.

++ Levinites

Levinites is the non-canonical name for all inhabitants within each Leviathan. In most cases, Levinites will not start to form and evolve until after a Leviathan has landed on a planet. However, on some occasion this will occur before planetary touch down. Levinites may range wildly in appearance, diet, and if applicable, culture and technological progression. Because of the irregular connection of internal dwelling cavities within each Leviathan, either made by Levinite hand or naturally formed, Levinites may vary radically even within one Leviathan.

As such, feel free to play around with various concepts of Levinites. Maybe there's a group that know of their Leviathan dwelling, maybe a large population are now taking to a planet after their Leviathan's death - there truly is no wrong direction to take them.
