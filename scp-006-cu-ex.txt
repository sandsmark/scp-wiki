**Special Containment Procedures:** All instances of SCP-006-CU-EX[[footnote]] Except for the ones with spiky parts. Those guy are meanies.[[/footnote]] are to be recovered by Mobile Task Force Phi-24 ("Exoskeleton Enthusiasts") and carefully brought to any Foundation site so they can be loved properly.

We CANNOT, I repeat CANNOT be washing our most valuable asset down the drain.[[/footnote]] cafeterias, gyms, and break rooms. We must have a chicken for every pot and a fly for every soup.

**Description:** SCP-006-CU-EX is the collective designation for a group of completely resplendent insectoids colloquially referred to as bugs[[footnote]] EXCEPT FOR THE SPIKY ones. We do not talk about those around here. [[/footnote]]. They all are so sweet and have soooo many wonderful textures. Between the contained instances of SCP-006-CU-EX we've found all of the beautiful colors of the double rainbow on their exoskeletons.

The feeling I get when an instance of SCP-006-CU-EX crawls on my skin makes me so giddy and bubbly that it has to be anomalous. All I want to do is hug them and hug them and never ever let them go.

**Addendum 006-CU-EX-01:** 
> As of ██/██/██ it has been determined that Assistant Entomologist Johnson has been affected by a memetic hazard and is scheduled for immediate termination. SCP-006-CU-EX has now been classified as explained. -O5-1

**Addendum 006-CU-EX-02:**
> I think he just //really// //really// likes bugs. It's probably not memetic, Obro-1. -Head Entomologist Patrick

**Addendum 006-CU-EX-03:**
> Head Entomologist Patrick has been slated for immediate termination because he has clearly been affected by a memetic hazard also. No more bugs. [[[SCP-006-J|We are once again at peace with nature.]]]
