**Item #:** SCP-1437

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1437 is to be contained behind a perimeter of two (2) meter tall electrical fencing, which is to be patrolled by groups of three (3) security officers at all times. Any trespassers attempting to access SCP-1437 are to be brought into custody, interrogated, and if found to be ignorant of SCP-1437's nature, dosed with a Class-A amnesiac and released.

Any items or organisms which emerge from SCP-1437 are to be immediately tested for hazards, and if found safe, examined further. Experimentation involving SCP-1437 is strictly forbidden.

**Description:** SCP-1437 is an apparently endless hole measuring 3m x 3m, located in the ██████ Desert. Attempts to dig into SCP-1437 from the side result in the diggers encountering solid rock where logic would dictate SCP-1437 would be. SCP-1437 is thus only accessible from its entrance above ground. 

SCP-1437 appears to be an access point to an as-of-yet unknown number of parallel universes. Objects have been known to periodically emerge from SCP-1437 at great speeds, including:

* One (1) US quarter. (First known object emergence.)
* Large quantities of dirt and rocks. (Believed to be an attempt by a parallel containment team to fill in their corresponding SCP-1437.)
* A map of North America written in Spanish. (According to said map, the government of North America is 'The People's Republic of Nuevas Aguas'.)
* A photograph of a skyline, believed to be a radically altered version of New York's. (Structures resembling coral are visible and a large flying organism can be seen in the distance.)
* Several disks made from solid gold. (Accompanying the disks was a sheet of paper reading 'PLEASE SEND RAIN'.)

During a period lasting from 200█-20██, numerous individuals, most of which wearing D-class uniforms, emerged from SCP-1437, all of which were dead on arrival. [[footnote]] It is theorized that the nature of SCP-1437 kills living organisms at the point at which crossover between universes is achieved. [[/footnote]] All emerging individuals carried documents which appear to be their respective universes documentation on SCP-1437. It is currently believed that these D-class personnel and previously mentioned documentation were sent as a gesture of desired cooperation.

Individual carrying documentation appeared to be in adequate physical condition. Individual was wearing a pressure suit with an attached oxygen supply.

> **Description:** SCP-1437 is an apparently endless hole measuring 5m x 5m, located in the town of Promise. Attempts to dig into SCP-1437 from the side result in the diggers encountering solid rock where logic would dictate SCP-1437 would be. SCP-1437 is thus only accessible from its entrance above ground.

> * Large quantities of dirt and rocks. (Believed to be an attempt by a parallel safety team to fill in their corresponding SCP-1437.)

> * Several disks made from solid gold. (Accompanying the disks was a sheet of paper reading 'PLEASE STOP PLAGUE'.)

> During a period lasting from 2009-2012, numerous individuals, most of which wearing bright orange jumpsuits, emerged from SCP-1437, all of which were dead on arrival. All emerging individuals carried documents which appear to be their respective universes documentation on SCP-1437. It is currently believed that these individuals and the documentation they carried were sent as a gesture of desired cooperation. On the 15th of August 2012, a volunteer from the Foundation, Marco Perton, entered SCP-1437 wearing safety gear, taking with him a copy of this document.

SCP-1437 is thus only accessible from its entrance above ground.

(The fact that it is apparently impossible to travel through SCP-1437 and survive has prevented the Corporation from utilizing SCP-1437 for commercial purposes.) All emerging individuals carried documents which appear to be their respective universes documentation on SCP-1437. It is currently believed that these D-class personnel and previously mentioned documentation were sent as a gesture of desired cooperation. Several D-class personnel have been sent through SCP-1437 carrying copies of this document.

Individual carrying documentation was wrapped in bandages and appeared to have been blinded in the recent past. Lacerations were present on the arms and legs, and the individuals tongue had been cut out.

Blood sacrifices are to hold copies of these scrolls as a warning to any demons to stay away. Spirits are to be consulted after these sacrifices, and suggested changes to holding measures are to be carried out immediately.

> * Large quantities of dirt and rocks. (Purpose unknown.)
> * Bark from the extinct //Quercus buckleyi//. (Delivered to Our Masters Above.)
> * The lower half of a human body. (Delivered to supervising Servant of Our Masters Above. It is currently unknown how the gift-sender was aware of the diet of Our Masters Above. A document was sent into SCP-1437 thanking the gift-giver for the object and requesting further tributes to Our Masters Above.)
> * A bottle of human-intended wine. (See Incident 1437-1.)
> 
> **Incident 1437-1:** On ██/██/██, a bottle of human-intended wine emerged from SCP-1437. Recognizing an assassination attempt upon members of Our Masters Above, the supervising Servant ordered that a Don-Burten explosive device be delivered down SCP-1437. Its orders were followed and the threat appears to have been resolved.
