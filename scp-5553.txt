**Item #:** SCP-5553
[[include :scp-sandbox-3:image-zoom name=jackemail.png|caption=An invitation email to join SCP-5553.|width=350px |link="http://www.scp-wiki.net/local--files/scp-5553/jackemail.png"]]
**Object Class:** Keter

**Secure Containment Procedures:** //New Procedures following the escape of D-7372:// SCP-5553 remains uncontained at this time. However, foundation Personnel with Special Clearance PSM-1 are required to engage with SCP-5553 regularly each day from a non-foundation personal computer, and file reports with External Affairs Team Sierra-611 in order to refer useful information obtained from SCP-5553 to local law enforcement agencies.

**Description:** SCP-5553 is a social media networking site called JACK, accessible from url @@https://jack.███@@. Its features include status posting, photo sharing, a news feed, public and private commenting, and direct private messaging. This site is only accessible to people who have committed serial murder of at least 3 victims.

Persons who are not eligible to view site content are exposed to an infohazard that causes confusion and memory loss related to the contents of the web page. In approximately 5% of cases, this effect is more severe, causing nearly-instantanious quadriplegia, intense pain, and subject death within 10 minutes, after which the device connected to SCP-5553 disconnects and shuts down. Premature shutdown of the device does not mitigate the lethal effect of the infohazard.

[[collapsible show="Addenda 5553.1: Site Content" hide="Close Addenda 5553.1: Site Content"]]
Invitations to join the site are sent via email to users with internet access who meet the above condition (Designated PSM-0). These emails are routed from the above (invalid) .███ domain but are otherwise non-anomalous.

Upon joining the site, PSM-0 users are allowed to utilize the site features. They can create a user profile under a pseudonym—or their real name if they so choose—and join discussion forums. These forums cover many topics related to homicide and other off-topic subject-matter. Several of these forums cater to specific interests, including support groups for users who want to reform or repent for past actions, and advice boards dedicated to sharing tips, tricks, and strategies to perform murders without being caught. The most popular board, the "Showcase", allows users to have their own individual page to act as a portfolio of past murders performed.

According to the site's "about" page, it was launched in 1999 by an entity under the pseudonym Moriarity. Reviews of ICANN[[footnote]]The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers[[/footnote]] records have produced no evidence of such a domain being registered, as .███ is not a valid top-level domain. An attempt to force ICANN to create the .███ domain for Foundation use is in progress.

An example of the news feed is reproduced below with the aid of a graphic artist.

D-7372 was transferred to Site-651 and interviewed by Foundation Staff, D-7372 agreed to aid Foundation researchers in providing information about the contents of SCP-5553.

72 hours after the end of the last test with D-7372, Site-651 suffered what appeared to be a non-anomalous security breach. D-7372, utilizing previously-unknown knowledge of Foundation security protocols, exited his holding cell, killed two Foundation personnel and successfully passed through 3 security checkpoints with unanticipated precision before escaping into the desert. 

An investigation into the escape revealed several security flaws in both personnel and software protocols which were quickly remedied.

The following memo was sent out to Foundation staff after receiving approvals from personnel and Internal Affairs directors.

> = Personnel Request
> 
> If you have a social media account on @@https://jack.███@@, please contact me immediately. Your privacy will be protected. Your "expertise" is required.

I know where you are. I know who's holding you. It's alright, I'm here to help you. Tell them I said you were active until recently and was worried about your well-being. Ask them if you are allowed to converse with me. They will likely say yes, as it will be an opportunity for them to get information, and that tends to blind their common sense sometimes.
