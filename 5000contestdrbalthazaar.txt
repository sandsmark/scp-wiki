**Item #:** SCP-5000

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5000-S1 is to be contained in Cell-5000-A, a 20 x 60 metre cylindrical containment chamber within Site 40-R. Cell-5000-A is constructed of reinforced concrete and ballistic glass 25cm thick. No nutrition or outside substances may be introduced into Cell-5000-A outside of testing.

Site 40-R has been constructed 200m from SCP-5000-A for the purpose of monitoring the site for the emergence of SCP-5000 instances from SCP-5000-B. Site 40-R Is to be equipped with aerial and aquatic rescue equipment alongside meteorological instruments. All parts of Site 40-R are to be covered in netting to protect staff from instances of SCP-5000. Upon confirmation of an instance of SCP-5000 emerging from SCP-5000-B, staff are to use meteorological data and predictive software to track the instance and predict where it will make landfall. Once a destination has been established, the area is to be evacuated and civilians instructed to remain indoors with the pretence of gas leak, storms, or viral outbreak. Aerial and seaborne traffic is also to be re-routed so that they may not approach closer than 10km from the instances projected flight path. No aircraft or watercraft are to be permitted within 10km of Site-40-B or SCP-5000-A and shall be re-routed upon approach. 

In the event of a failed evacuation procedure, teams dispatched from Site 40-R are to make efforts to minimize the number of abductions via small arms fire and hiding of civilians. All witnesses of these events are to be administered Class-B Amnestics and the abductions are to be explained by drowning, non-anomalous abduction or truancy. Any individuals abducted by SCP-5000 are to be considered lost and may be terminated at staff discretion. Witness statements issued prior to Foundation involvement are to be discredited via SCP plants within UFO conspiracy groups and organizations, fabrication of death certificates, and amnestics.

Any personnel conducting research on SCP-5000-A must not remain still for longer than 40 minutes, and any items left on its surface for longer than 2 hours are to be considered lost. All personnel conducting research on SCP-5000-A are to be fitted with fast retrieval harnesses fitted to an offshore vessel. In the event of attack by SCP-5000 the vessel is to winch the staff to the vessel and return to Site 40-R until it is deemed safe to return. No research may be conducted without the presence of a fire team, and under no circumstances are any staff to enter SCP-5000-B. No attempt to rescue individuals abducted by SCP-5000, shipwreck survivors, or plane crash survivors deposited onto SCP-5000-A is to be made, though remote termination is permitted with Level 3 oversight.

--Following Expedition 5000-19-S a reinforced concrete and steel containment seal measuring 44m in diameter and 6m thick was constructed and fitted over SCP-5000-B in order to permanently seal it.-- 

Following Incident 5000-40-R-12, SCP-5000-B is not to be covered or sealed under any circumstances.

**Description:** SCP-5000 is the collective designation of malicious, partially-humanoid entities that maintain a territory across the Bass Strait, the area of ocean that divides Tasmania and the Australian mainland, and are responsible for a string of disappearances within this range. 

The morphology of SCP-5000 often varies. Universally, SCP-5000 are composed of groups of between 2 and 9 human bodies fused together amidst large clusters of black tentacles. These tentacles appear to have lengths varying between approximately 2 and 70 metres, and appear fused to the skin where they touch directly. Of note are the stomachs of SCP-5000, which are grossly distorted and swollen to sizes approaching 15 to 20 metres in diameter. SCP-5000 instances are capable of passive flight, attaining buoyancy through enormous quantities of gases produced within their stomachs; across the surface of these organs most specimens develop clusters of simple eyes and bioluminescent organs. Many of their humanoid components appear to have been removed and reattached at seemingly random points. 

Encounters with SCP-5000 have been known since at least 1858, with the first successful visual recordings accomplished in late 1982 when an instance of SCP-5000 was recorded abducting five children from a Tasmanian beach.
Human segments of SCP-5000 appear to remain independent of one another and their behaviour suggests a great deal of discomfort. Vocalizations are incoherent and rarely understandable, typically comprised of gasps, moans and whimpers, though entities have been reported to implore other individuals to approach them when encountered. Ineffectual attempts at self-harm or destruction of stomach organs have been reported as well.

**Behaviour:** SCP-5000 are known to abduct human beings. 

Each recorded encounter has followed a similar pattern. Victims are almost universally alone or otherwise unsupervised; of note is that victims never require visual aids such as glasses. SCP-5000 may appear in any weather condition, time of day, or time of year. They appear able to navigate all weather with minimal difficulty, regardless of clear or hostile skies. All encounters have occurred within Bass Strait, with a major preference for smaller coastal towns or small boats. 

SCP-5000 will move towards the shore, stalking the intended victim for a short time before lowering numerous tentacles and appendages to physically grab the individual. A single instance may abduct multiple people at once, with one instance successfully abducting eight men from the decks of a commercial fishing boat within 15 seconds of one another. Once the victims are securely captured, SCP-5000 instances will return to the open water at great speed, often in excess of 320kph.

Tracking instances of SCP-5000 has shown that they inhabit a remote reef within Bass Strait, resting and depositing abductees there. 

**Acquisition Log:** Initial investigations that led to the discovery of SCP-5000 were disparate investigations into the region, and early theories did not connect so many unusual abductions across such a wide area and across such a wide time period. Theories included an anomalous group of persons, one or more hostile aerial entities inhabiting the stratosphere, phenomena associated with unidentified flying objects, subterranean anomalies, time quirks, and unusual weather patterns.

However, after the disappearance of an Agent Taberner's three young children[[footnote]] Jillian Taberner, Elizabeth Taberner and William Taberner. [[/footnote]] and wife [[footnote]] Mary Taberner[[/footnote]] from a beach in broad daylight in 1980, further research into the region was prioritized. It was soon discovered that reports of UFOs and lights in the sky had coincided with many disappearances in the immediate region, and patterns emerged as this was kept at the forefront of further research.
The Foundation immediately began with a focus on simply locating the four lost Taberner family members; this search rapidly opened up into a large-scale investigation into unexplained disappearances following similar patterns along the Victorian coast and later the Tasmanian coast and local islands. Initial assumptions that they had been taken by a Group of Interest or an unknown, local terrestrial element were soon found to be incorrect. Within 3 weeks it was determined that these patterns were common across the entirety of the Bass Strait’s coastal regions. 

Foundation teams successfully interviewed over 120 witnesses, next of kin, and police groups to establish patterns. They soon discovered that in a vast majority of cases there were no witnesses, the abductions were both preceded and followed by reports of lights in the sky and more concrete sightings of unidentified flying objects described as "looking like balloons."
On 23/5/1982, emergency services call centers received a large number of UFO sightings off the coast of Norman Bay, Victoria. Foundation plants within the call centers and emergency organizations alerted local Sites, and task force operatives were dispatched to investigate, upon arrival confirming the appearance and existence of what are now documented as SCP-5000. 

After a brief evacuation and encounter with the entity, it was successfully captured and transported to Site-40 for containment. The discovery of SCP-5000-A prompted the subsequent construction of Site-40-R and designation of the entity as SCP-5000-S1.

> **Interviewed:** Alan Stewart.
> 
> **Interviewer:** Dr. ██████████
> 
> **Foreword:** During the initial investigation into SCP-5000 prior to the containment of SCP-5000-S1, the Foundation conducted numerous interviews with relatives of suspected victims of SCP-5000 in an effort to determine a pattern for the disappearances. Among the interviewed was Alan Stewart, who was present during the disappearance of former Australian Prime Minister Harold Holt. Due to the high profile nature of this disappearance, Dr. ██████████ posed as a reporter writing an article about the disappearance.
> ------
> 
> **<Begin Log>**
> 
> **Dr. ██████████:** Thank you seeing me Mr. Stewart, I know you must be tired of people asking about what happened that day. As I said when we contacted you, we wanted to hear what happened from someone who was actually there, none of the hearsay that's become so common these days.
> 
> **Stewart:** No worries. So, uh, where should I start? 
> 
> **Dr. ██████████:** I think when you entered the water would be best.
> 
> **Stewart:** Alright. Well we were still disappointed about not getting to see the yacht pass into the bay, so we decided to go for a swim. The girls and Marty[[footnote]] Marjorie Gillespie, Vyner Gillespie and Martin Simpson, who were also present at the disappearance.[[/footnote]] took one look at the water and said they weren't going in. I mean, sure it was rough, but at the time I didn't think it was all that bad. 
> 
> **Dr. ██████████:** You and Mr. Holt were experienced swimmers then?
> 
> **Stewart:** Yeah. We'd both been there loads of times. But once we were about waist deep I could feel an undertow. I said to Harold, Do you think we should stay in the shallows? And he just grinned at me and swam out further. I went out a little further but I wasn't the swimmer he was, so I didn't go as far. I could see he was starting to look less sure of himself too. I called out to him, said that maybe he should come back in and he nodded. Then he looked over his shoulder and he said something about some balloons. I never understood what that was about.
> 
> **Dr. ██████████:** Balloons? What did he say specifically?
> 
> **Stewart:** It was the strangest thing. He looked at me and asked if I could see the balloons around the cliff. I said no, and he said he was going to look. I asked him why he cares about some balloons, said he should come in to shore. He just shook his head and said that they weren't normal balloons, that there was someone inside of them. Then he swam away.
> 
> //Mr. Stewart is silent for several moments, shaking his head.//
> 
> **Dr. ██████████:** What happened next, Mr. Stewart?
> 
> **Stewart:** Everyone knows what happened next. The rip swept him away. It took him out so fast, like a leaf being pulled out in the tide. You could see him swimming sideways, trying to get out like you're supposed to. I... It doesn't matter.
> 
> **Dr. ██████████:** Mr. Stewart?
> 
> **Stewart:** It's nothing. I was just rattled from seeing a friend taken by the current is all. You think you see things in those situations, sometimes.
> 
> **Dr. ██████████:** What did you think you saw?
> 
> **Stewart:** You'll think I'm a loon.
> 
> **Dr. ██████████:** I can assure you I won't, Mr. Stewart. What you feel like you saw doesn't have to be in the article if you don't want.
> 
> //Mr. Stewart nods and pauses for several moments.//
> 
> **Stewart:** I saw... I thought I saw Harold start screaming and swimming the other way. Just as he was almost just a dot on the horizon, you know? I think he saw something awful out there in the water, maybe something to do with his balloons. And... And then... 
> 
> //Mr. Stewart pauses and rubs his face.//
> 
> **Stewart:** I saw him pulled up into the air. Something... Something in the clouds reached down and took him. I saw it. Marty says it was just a trick of the light, but... But I don't think it was. I really don't.
> 
> **Dr. ██████████:** I'm sorry Mr. Stewart. I didn't want to make you relive something like that. We'll call it a day here, alright?
> 
> **Stewart:** You believe me don't you? 
> 
> **Dr. ██████████:** We all see things sometimes, Mr. Stewart. Thank you for your time.
> 
> **<End Log>**
> 
> **Closing Statement:** //It seems that Mr. Stewart is our only eyewitness to an abduction event thus far. Unfortunately, given the eighteen years between the sighting and this interview, amnestics are not an option here and Mr. Stewart will need to be discredited should he attempt to spread his account of events.//

[[collapsible show="++ Discovery of SCP-5000-A." hide="ACCESS GRANTED"]]
[[include component:image-block name=http://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/balths-sandbox/missing.jpg|caption=Map displaying suspected victims of SCP-5000 between 1980- Present.]]

Following extensive interviews with witnesses, compiling a database of likely victims and the containment of SCP-5000-S1, it was determined that there must be at least 16 instances of SCP-5000 as yet unaccounted for. As a result of this information, the search for SCP-5000's origin point was made a top priority. Foundation personnel were to closely monitor the coastlines and waters of Bass Strait, and were keeping various Marine survey teams equipped with class-b aquatic research vessels on standby to track any discovered instances of SCP-5000 to its point of origin.

At 3:21 AM, the 19/5/1985 Foundation survey teams operating out of Site 40 reported a sighting of a large SCP-5000 specimen headed towards the coastal town of Kilcunda, Victoria, from Bass Strait. Marine survey team 40-Alpha was sent to track the specimen in an effort to determine its point of origin. The following is a video log taken from Sgt. ████ Price's body camera of the resulting events.

**Exploration Video Log Transcript**

**Date:** 19/5/1985

**Exploration Team:** Marine survey Team 40-Alpha

**Subject:** SCP-5000

**Team Lead:** Sgt. ████ Price

**Team Members:** Cpl. ███████ Bentley, Cpl. ███ Mathers, Cpl. ████ Zmegac
-----

[BEGIN LOG]

**Sgt. Price:** There's the entity up ahead, team. Stay sharp, and don't open the protective covers. These things are supposed to have a long reach and I don't want any of you lot being taken.

//A large instance of SCP-5000 can be seen approximately 75 metres away, floating above a private fishing vessel. The instance is estimated to be 23m in diameter, composed of 7 individuals. five of these individuals remain unidentified, with the other two being confirmed as Mark and Hope ███████, who disappeared on their honeymoon in 1963.//

**Cpl. Mathers:** Yes sir.

**Cpl. Zmegac:** Damn, it really does look like a UFO. Look at the green lights.

**Cpl. Mathers:** Oh God, I think I'm going to be sick.

**Crl. Bentley:** What is it?

**Cpl. Mathers:** That man and woman up there. It's... It's like they're clay and they’ve been crushed together... there's a tentacle growing into her mouth...

**Sgt. Price:** Enough. Keep it together Mathers. Those are not people, they are just a part of the specimen.

**Cpl. Mathers:** Yes sir, sorry.

**Cpl Bentley:** Sir, that's a boat it's flying towards, I think it's going to attack.

**Sgt. Price:** Agreed. Zmegac, get us over there.

**Cpl. Zmegac:** Yes sir.

//40-Alpha proceeds to approach the fishing vessel, identified as the "License to Chill" registered to one Mr. Gregory Bolwell[[footnote]] Abductee-4 [[/footnote]]. The vessel is occupied by 6 individuals, dubbed Abductees 1-6. Abductee-1 is on the deck while the remaining crew can be seen within the cabin eating breakfast. The SCP-5000 instance is now directly ahead of the fishing boat, and is spotted by Abductee-1.//

**Abductee-1:** What the fuck is that?

**Abductee-4:** What’s what? Come on Jane, finish your smoke and come get some brekkie. Alice made eggs.

**Abductee-6:** They're really good!

//The SCP-5000 instance partially lowers itself toward the boat. Several of its tentacles are trailing in the water and it appears to be observing the crew of the boat. it slowly turns so that the majority of its humanoid parts are facing Abductee-1.//

**SCP-5000:** I see you. You will help me see.

**Abductee-1:** Fuck!

**Abductee-3:** Look at the balloons mummy!

//Abductee-1 sprints towards the door to the cabin of the boat, but is seized by a tentacle and pulled into the air.//

**Abductee-5:** Jane!

**Abductee-2:** Oh God!

**Abductee- 4:** Get us the hell out of here!

//Abductee-5 attempts to exit the cabin, but is restrained by Abductee-2 and Abductee-4.//

**Abductee-2:** No, you can't!

**Abductee-5:** Let me go, she's my wife!

//The SCP-5000 instance proceeds to run its tentacles along the windows of the cabin until the door is located. At this point, a tentacle ending in a mass of human hands opens the door and enters the cabin, grabbing Abductee-2 and violently pulling them outside into the air. Abductees 3-6 panic and attempt to force the tentacle out of the cabin with objects at hand.//

**Cpl. Bentley:** Jesus Sarge... Are you sure we can't help them?

**Sgt. Price:** Positive. Disrupting the event could jeopardize the mission.

//The SCP-5000 specimen successfully captures Abductees 3-6, and proceeds towards 40-Alpha.//

**Sgt. Price:** Don't worry, the entryway is locked and rated to remain sealed under five tonnes of force. It can't get in.

**Cpl. Mathers:** I bloody well hope so.

**Cpl. Zmegac:** Is five tonnes enough?

**Cpl. Bentley:** Jesus, they're trying to strangle themselves and are throwing up orange shit...

**Sgt. Price:** The crew of the fishing boat?

**Cpl. Price:** No, the peo- the humanoid components of the scip.

**Sgt. Price:** Don't worry about it. Just wait this out and we'll follow it to wherever the hell it lives.

**Cpl. Zmegac:** Roger.

//The SCP-5000 instance runs its tentacles over 40-Alpha's ship, repeatedly trying to force open the entrance hatch, but is unable to gain entry. It lowers down and closely examines the ship and the crew within at length.//

**Cpl. Mathers:** Jesus, its eyes... They're like beach balls.

**Cpl. Zmegac:** I've never seen beach balls like those.

**Sgt. Price:** Enough. Quiet.

//The specimen shudders and rises back into the air, before heading in a south-western direction.//

**Sgt. Price:** Zmegac, get after it. Don't lose it.

**Cpl. Zmegac:** Sir.

**Sgt. Price:** Bentley, tag it.

//Cpl. Bentley proceeds to fire one "Issurus" class harpoon tracker towards the specimen, successfully implanting it on one of its tentacles.//

**Sgt. Price:** Good shot son.

**Cpl. Bentley:** Cheers.

//The SCP-5000 specimen continues on a south-westerly course, with 40-Alpha following. This takes 4 hours 19 minutes, with 40-Alpha falling significantly behind the specimen, but catching back up as it slowed down once past sight of land.//

**Sgt. Price:** There! Look! It's heading to that reef!

**Cpl. Zmegac:** Fuck me, look at them all.

//Footage shows a large, grey reef ahead, featuring several shipwrecks upon it. There are 13 more SCP-5000 instances floating over the area, some appearing to hold onto the reef with their tentacles.//

**Cpl. Mathers:** Looks like it’s going to land, sir.

**Sgt. Price:** Definitely.

//The specimen slows to a stop above the reef as Alpha-40 pulls alongside it. The SCP-5000 instance lowers Abductees 1-6 towards the reef, before dropping them slightly above the ground.//

**Abductee-4:** Is everyone okay?

**Abductee-1:** No I'm not fucking okay!

**Abductee-2:** What are those things?

**Abductee-6:** Look! A boat!

//Abductee-6 runs towards Alpha-40, but is grabbed and attacked by a large [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4159 SCP-4159] instance from within a crevice in the reef. Abductee-2 rushes to help, but is deterred by multiple other specimens emerging from the water.//

**Cpl. Zmegac:** Oh god, look at them all.

**Sgt. Price:** I've never seen so many.

//SCP-4159 instances proceed to swarm Abductee-6. Remaining Abductees flee a ways before waving their arms and calling to Alpha-40 for help, displaying significant signs of distress.//

**Cpl. Mathers:** We've tracked them now, can't we at least help them now?

**Cpl. Zmegac:** I'm not going over there with that many of those things out there.

**Sgt. Price:** Negative, we need to know what they do to people here. 

**Cpl. Bentley:** Jesus.

//Abductees 1-5 continue to attempt to enlist Alpha-40's aid, before eventually giving in and exploring the reef. Upon approaching the centre of the reef they discover a large pool. Voicing apprehension about further attacks from SCP-4159, the group begins to retreat from its edge, before multiple SCP-5000 and SCP-4159 instances converge upon them.//

**Abductee-3:** They're coming back!

**Abductee-1:** Maybe they can't get us in the water!

**Abductee-5:** Jump!

//Abductees 1, 2, 3 and 5 dive into the pool. Abductee-4 appears to hesitate, before being swarmed by multiple SCP-4159 specimens. The remaining abductees display severe distress, and tread water for some time.//

**Abductee-1:** Now what?

**Abductee-5:** I don't know, we'll think of something.

//Abductee-2 is abruptly pulled below the water.//

**Abductee-5:** What do you think Alice?

**Abductee-1:** Alice?

**Abductee-3:** Where is she? Where is mummy? I'm scared auntie Jane!

//Abductee-3 is pulled below the surface.//

**Abductee-1:** Sarah!

**Abductee-5:** What the fuck, was that a tentacle? Wait, no!

//Abductee-5 is pulled below the surface. Abductee-1 panics and attempts to swim to the edge of the pool, but is menaced by SCP-5000 and SCP-4159. She screams and is abruptly pulled below the surface. Alpha-40 is silent for 72 seconds.//

**Sgt. Price:** Let's just go home.

Following a review of the footage presented from the body cams, the agents reports and the tracking data, Foundation teams determined that this reef if the home and Origin of SCP-5000 and has been dubbed SCP-5000-A. As such, Site 40-R has been constructed 200m East of SCP-5000-A for the purpose of monitoring and research.

[[/collapsible]]

**Addendum 5000-03:**
[[collapsible show="++ SCP-5000-A and SCP-5000-B. LEVEL 3 CLEARANCE REQUIRED." hide="ACCESS GRANTED"]]
[[include component:image-block name=http://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/balths-sandbox/5000-a.jpg|caption=SCP-5000-A.]]

SCP-5000-A is a large intertidal reef measuring approximately 1.3km^^2^^ located in central Bass Strait. It is largely composed of a previously unknown variety of dark porous rock visually similar to granite, which often seeps iron oxide from an unknown source. This rock possesses the anomalous property of an extraordinarily fast rate of growth. Where non-anomalous rock generally takes millions of years to achieve any significant growth, SCP-5000-A can achieve significant growth in as little as 40 minutes. While the violent waters surrounding it keep this growth rate from expanding SCP-5000-A, it does not impede the growth of rock over foreign objects resting upon it. As a result of this, there are numerous wrecked ships and aircraft on SCP-5000-A that have been completely grown over with rock. 

SCP-5000-A has proven to be a haven for various anomalous forms of marine life. Much of its surface is host to a form of red algae[[footnote]] SCP-5000-A1 [[/footnote]] that are specialised to feed upon the freshly grown rock of SCP-5000-A, numerous marine worms capable of temporary levitation[[footnote]] SCP-5000-A2 [[/footnote]] and marine spiders[[footnote]] SCP-5000-A3 [[/footnote]] with leg spans of 1 to 3 metres living below the waterline in silk retreats they construct similarly to non anomalous marine spiders. Additionally, there are various small fish inhabiting the rock pools and surrounding waters of SCP-5000-A that have not been discovered elsewhere. [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4159 SCP-4159] migrate to SCP-5000-A between November and March, residing within its rock pools and the surrounding waters.

SCP-5000-A has been confirmed as the origin point for SCP-5000, which often rest here holding onto outcroppings with their tentacles while inactive.

There is a large pit in the centre of SCP-5000-A measuring 33m in diameter and extending to an as yet unknown depth below the surface of the water. This pit has been dubbed SCP-5000-B, and unmanned exploration via drones has shown it to have a depth of at least 4000m. Water samples collected from SCP-5000-B contain large quantities of human DNA, //Carnobacterium pleistocenium//[[footnote]] Previously only found in permafrost from over 32,000 years BC [[/footnote]], and an unknown biological compound possessing significant life preservative qualities. Testing has shown that organisms submerged in this solution are able to survive grievous injuries for an indeterminate amount of time, even when fully submerged and unable to breathe.

Exploration of one of the shipwrecks located on SCP-5000-A revealed a journal within a chest. Most of it was illegible due to water damage, but one passage has proven to be of interest to the Foundation.

Me and Fletcher both seen things beneath the waves, like great black serpents with yellow eyes. I weren't going to tell the crew, lest I frighten them, but Fletcher went and spouted out about it. Feels as if they are whipping up these waves, and there is naught we can do of it. Moresby spied land ahead, and the boys say there are giant balloons hanging over the island. We are all afeared, but there is naught we can do but beach ourselves and hope for rescue. Should I be killed in the crash, I want my mates to give this journal to my Mary might know I spent my last thinking only of her.//

Frederick Valentich was a pilot engaged in a training flight over Bass Strait on the 21/10/1978 whose disappearance can be attributed to SCP-5000. Unfortunately, transcripts of his transmissions to Melbourne air traffic control during this event were released to the public prior to Foundation involvement. As such, Foundation web scrubbers have made efforts to discredit paranormal theories by posing as members of the online UFO community while the official explanation for is disappearance is that "Valentich became disorientated and saw his own lights reflected in the water, or lights from a nearby island, while flying upside down."

> **Valentich:** //Delta Sierra Juliet, Melbourne...//
> 
> **Melbourne:** //Delta Sierra Juliet, Melbourne?//
> 
> **Notes:** At this point the transmission was interrupted by unidentified noise described as being "metallic, scraping sounds" before all contact was lost.

Prior to Foundation involvement there have been numerous government and civilian searches for Valentichs wreckage, all unsuccessful. It was only during an unmanned exploration of SCP-5000-B that the wreckage of his aircraft was found embedded in the rocky walls 1200 metres below sea level. The plane appeared to have been crushed under tremendous pressure. Foundation personnel operating out of Site 40-R were able to recover the wreckage for analysis on the 27/10/1993 with no losses. 

Analysis of the wreckage showed that the craft had suffered catastrophic engine failure due to a collision with a large biological mass, forcing the aircraft to be ditched into the water, causing further damage. Analysis of the interior revealed the presence of human remains matching Valentich's description mixed with DNA samples not matching any known form of life, along with an aftermarket cockpit recording device. Although partially damaged, a transcript of the recording is available below.

> **Recording Transcript:** 
> ------
> Rapid breathing can be heard along with the sound of the planes engine running poorly. Melbourne air traffic control can be heard attempting to reach Valentich over the radio.
> 
> **Valentich:** //Oh god don't come any closer, stay up there- Shit, no!//
> 
> There is a loud crash and the engine stalls.
> 
> **Valentich:** //Jesus it hit me! It's crashed right into me and it’s jammed the propellers! God no, I'm going down!//
> 
> **SCP-5000:** //You will see.//
> 
> Valentich can be heard screaming and panicking for 23 seconds before seeming to regain some composure.
> 
> **Valentich:** //Attempting to uh, to glide as long as I can before ditching in the water. Got to... Got to hope someone comes looking.//
> 
> Wind, SCP-5000 and Valentich's exertions can be heard for 2 minutes 48 seconds until the plane impacts the water. Various electrical shorts and crashing sounds are heard upon impact.
> 
> **Valentich:** //Ow! God. That was worse than I thought it would be. Uh, no leaks in here yet, the... The thing fell off on impact thank god. The sea is choppy, I've activated a distress call but the radio is all smashed.//

> A loud splash, followed by a bang can be heard.
> 
> **Valentich:** //No! Stop! Oh god the tentacle is back. It's back! It's looking at me and it's grabbing the plane! No! No, don't!//
> 
> Sound from outside the plane becomes muffled, suggesting it has been submerged fully.
> 
> **Valentich:** //Please let me go, let me go, let me go!//
> 
> Valentich proceeds to panic and express distress for a further 39 minutes before the plane can be heard to groan as though being crushed. There is a shattering sound and water can be heard rushing inside of the cockpit.
> 
> **Notes:** Nothing else of note was recorded following this point. Based on the crush damage to the plane it is hypothesised that an unknown entity connected to SCP-5000-B physically pulled Valentichs aircraft at least 8000 metres below sea level. This entity is believed to have been responsible for Abductees 1-6 disappearance within SCP-5000-B, and to be the same described in Recovered Documentation 5000-1.

[[include component:image-block name=http://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/balths-sandbox/Clydethomas|caption=Site 40-R as seen from SCP-5000-A.]]
Following the construction of Site-40-R a log of all SCP-5000 departures and returns has been maintained, with instances returning with abducted victims 83% less often than prior to current containment procedures. However, on the 19/4/2003 Site 40-R logged three SCP-5000 instances departing SCP-5000-A, and on the 23/4/2008 recorded thirty six instances returning, with only two not having any fresh abductees. No monitoring post has any records of missing persons, SCP-5000 sightings, or satellite data indicating the presence of these as yet unaccounted for instances.

This event was followed by the largest SCP-5000 instance being [DATA EXPUNGED] by a large tentacle originating from SCP-5000-B. This process took 78 hours, and necessitated a 26% increase in on site psychological counselling. 

While the presence of a large entity below SCP-5000-B has been suspected for some time, this is the first concrete evidence presented to the Foundation to date. This entity has been designated SCP-5000-C, and the confirmation of its existence will necessitate a manned exploration of SCP-5000-B in order to determine the nature of SCP-5000-C, with Dr. Steenstrup volunteering for the mission.

----
**DATE:** 4/12/2017

**NOTE:** In an effort to determine the nature of both SCP-5000-B and SCP-5000-C, it was determined that a manned exploration of SCP-5000-B would be necessary. Between the 19/5/2008 and the 4/12/2017 there have been thirty seven attempted expeditions, all of which resulted in failure due to hull collapse caused by intense pressure. Working collaboratively with private companies, the Foundation was able to develop a deep sea submersible capable of diving to a maximum of 13,500m underwater[[footnote]] Dubbed the //SCPS Nautilus// [[/footnote]]. Following the losses of trained personnel on previous exploration attempts, it was decided that a D-Class personnel [[footnote]] D-5000-98 [[/footnote]] would be trained in the operation of this submersible and would carry out the mission. D-5000-98 was instructed to dive to the bottom of SCP-5000-B and to describe significant depth readings.
Cameras mounted on the exterior of the //SCPS Nautilus// and a microphone mounted within would record all possible detail. Due to the depth of the water involved in this test, remote viewing of this footage was impossible and required physical recollection of the vessel to view.
**Note on brevity and corruption:** //Due to extraneous and irrelevant footages removal and the data corruption present in its later stages of the log, this is not the full record of Exploration 5000-B-38.//

[BEGIN LOG]

**{{[00:00:01]}}:** D-5000-98 completes pre-dive preparations and checks on himself and the //SCPS Nautilus//, and is craned over SCP-5000-B.

**{{[00:02:30]}}:** **D-5000-98:** //All systems are good, I'm ready to submerge.//

**{{[00:03:00]}}:** //SCPS Nautilus// is lowered into SCP-5000-B and is disconnected from the crane. 

**{{[00:03:19]}}:** **D-5000-98:** //Looking good, headed down. Seeing a lot of strange blacky yellow vines growing around the walls of the trench.//

**{{[00:26:35]}}:** Visibility is good, and black tendrils with yellow markings can be seen lining the walls of the pit.

**{{[00:32:12]}}:** Several SCP-5000-A3 instances are seen inhabiting a large communal web. The largest extends a limb to touch the //SCPS Nautilus// before quickly withdrawing.

**{{[00:37:08]}}:** A large SCP-5000 instance comes into view, clinging to a rocky outcropping. All of its eyes follow the //SCPS Nautilus//, and many of the previously seen tendrils are wrapped around the specimen and inside of its orifices, particularly the mouths and noses of the individuals composing the bulk of the specimen.

**{{[00:37:20]}}:** **D-5000-98:** //Jesus, is that a plane its holding onto? Uh, 528 metres down.//

**{{[00:37:30]}}:** Another 16 SCP-5000 instances are seen resting against the walls of SCP-5000-B between 528 and 1750 metres.

**{{[01:03:27]}}:** **D-5000-98:** //Natural light is all gone. I'm glad those things don't seem interested in me.// 

**{{[01:13:52]}}:** A large six gill shark swims past the //SCPS-Nautilus// and proceeds to attack an SCP-5000-A3 instance. 

**{{[01:15:00]}}:** **D-5000-98:** //2123 metres down n- holy crap, where did he come from?//

[[include component:image-block name=http://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/balths-sandbox/Six-gill_shark.jpg|caption=01:13:52.]]

**{{[01:20:00]}}:** Another 119 SCP-5000 instances and 487 SCP-4159 instances are seen between 2123 and 5391 metres deep, along with 58 overgrown plane wrecks. These wrecks are often inhabited by SCP-5000-A3 instances. There is no natural light penetrating to this depth.

**{{[03:45:36]}}:** **D-5000-98:** //How am I not at the bottom? They said they didn't think it went deeper than 4000 metres. What is that? Seeing machines at 5520 metres.//

**{{[03:53:19]}}:** Numerous unmanned submersibles are seen tangled in the black tendrils growing along the walls, some are nearly fully covered by stone.

**{{[03:58:56]}}:** The //SCPS Nautilus// passes a badly damaged human arm, which appears to have been crushed. The arm is visibly twitching

**{{[03:59:03]}}:** **D-5000-98:** //Oh my god. Uh, 5800 metres now, seeing human remains. God I can't wait to get back up and go home. I wouldn't mind just going back to prison at this point, it feels so fucking wrong down here.//

**{{[04:19:19]}}:** The SCPS Nautilus passes into a brine pool, and visibility drops.

**{{[04:19:26]}}:** **D-5000-98** //Visibility's even worse down here. 6000 metres now, just passed into the brine layer. I'm not seeing any fish or anything.//

**{{[04:40:40]}}:** The //SCPS Nautilus// enters a large mass of human remains similar to the arm encountered at 03:58:56. The remains all appear to have been crushed, drained of blood and possessing intact eyes. D-5000-98 can be heard hyperventilating as they enter this area. Each individual floating in this area is alive and attempting to move despite the enormous damage to their bodies. All can be seen to visibly observe the //SCPS Nautilus// as it passes them.

**{{[04:44:44]}}:** **D-5000-98:** //Oh my god, oh no no no no. This can't be possible, how are they moving?//

**{{[04:47:52]}}:** At this point, the remains are attempting to grab the //SCPS Nautilus// and appear to be attempting to communicate with it. Thumping can be heard inside the submersible as they bump against it.

**{{[05:27:19]}}:** **D-5000-98** //They're saying something, Oh god they're talking to me, what are they saying?//

**{{[05:34:21]}}:** One set of partial remains floats in front of the //SCPS Nautilus//, looking directly at the camera. Later analysis confirmed this to be the remains of former Australian Prime Minister Harold Holt. It mouths something to the camera, unable to be deciphered by Foundation lip readers.

**{{[05:34:28]}}:** **D-5000-98:** //Go back! They’re saying go back! Oh fuck no, I can't do this, I can't! I've gone down 6700 metres, I'm not going further.//

**{{[06:03:47]}}:** //SCPS Nautilus//' rate of descent can be seen to slow, but passes the mass of human remains into clear water again.

**{{[06:08:09]}}:** **D-5000-98:** //I... Please let it be over... I can't see that again. I... Maybe there's a different way out at the bottom, please...//

**{{[06:10:23]}}:** D-5000-98 can be heard performing calming breathing exercises for 19 minutes.

**{{[06:29:56]}}:** **D-5000-98:** //Okay, let's keep going. Currently at 7208 metres down.//

**{{[07:08:24]}}:** A Foundation submersible comes into view floating in the open water. It has visibly imploded.

**{{[07:08:29]}}:** **D-5000-98:** //Jesus. I'm glad this one's top of the line... 8963 metres, encountered a destroyed submersible.//

**{{[07:45:07]}}:** A large black tentacle can be seen rapidly emerging from below. It is approximately 8 metres in diameter and features numerous yellow eyes growing on it. This tentacle proceeds to wrap around the //SCPS Nautilus// and begins to rapidly drag it down. D-5000-98 can be heard panicking and expressing distress during this process.

**{{[07:45:47]}}:** **D-5000-98:** //Please God save me and deliver me and forgive my sins I don't want to die five miles under the sea I want to see my Chloe again please Go-//

**{{[07:53:94]}}:** At this point data corruption begins affecting the footage. No audio can be heard and there is static present in the footage.

**{{[07:57:34]}}:** Eight more tentacles can be seen rising towards the //SCPS-Nautilus//. Three of these possess large openings on their ends, which proceed to open as they approach the submersible, revealing large clusters of eyes, mouths and human heads seemingly grafted to the tentacles. 

**{{[08:13:40]}}:** Static and blurred images. D-5000-98 can be heard vomiting, followed by a muffled thump as he presumably loses consciousness.

**{{[10:74:85]}}:** The //SCPS Nautilus// appears to now be resting on the sea floor, with no rocky walls in sight. Black tendrils cover the seabed and detritus in the water moves irregularly, indicating something moving off camera. A dark shape begins to approach the //Nautilus//.

**{{[10:76:20]}}:** Static.

**{{[11:03:52]}}:** The //SCPS Nautilus// is now resting on a rocky shelf overhanging a drop off. A mass of thin tentacles are emerging from within this drop off and are holding ████ Taberner and ██████ Anderson.[[footnote]] Disappeared from Deal Island in 2001 [[/footnote]] The tentacles proceed to press the individuals together, causing them fuse together by unknown means. Both individuals show signs of significant distress. The tentacles proceed to further alter both victims, before thin green tentacles enter the frame from above and force themselves into the victims abdomens, which begin to swell. 
[[include component:image-block name=http://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/balths-sandbox/context%20unknown.jpg|caption=11:97:97.]]

**{{[11:97:97]}}:** Static, unclear fragments of images.

**{{[44:44:44]}}:** Entire frame is filled by an enormous eye ringed with tentacles, large claws and human remains. It is estimated to be at least 650 metres in diameter. D-5000-98 can be heard screaming for the entire duration of this portion of footage.

**{{[12:35:08]}}:** Static

**{{[12:38:48]}}:** [DATA EXPUNGED]

**{{[12:58:19]}}:** The //SCPS Nautilus// is rapidly ascending, though the cameras are partially obscured by an unknown substance. D-5000-98 can be heard babbling and vomiting.

**{{[13:02:15]}}:** **D-5000-98:** //It saw me! It saw me! It saw everything, it wants to know everything, why can I see so much? I don't want it to see me anymore please make it stop looking at me!//

**{{[15:37:12]}}:** The //SCPC Nautilus// breaches the surface. Recovery teams successfully recover the submersible.

> Upon the recovery of the //SCPS Nautilus// it was found that the submersible was almost entirely covered in a thick organic coating. This coating was visually similar to a black slime mold, but was host to dozens of eyes growing from it. Additionally, the submersible itself had suffered partial crush damage rendering the access hatches inoperable. Recovery team 2 proceeded to transport the //Nautilus// to Site 40-R in a temporary containment system so that D-5000-98 and the recordings could be safely extracted.
> 
> Upon their extrication from the //SCPS Nautilus//, D-5000-98 immediately attempted to attack Foundation personnel and harm themselves. They showed signs of anomalous physical alteration, namely the growth of numerous eyes over their upper body and arms. On-site security determined that D-5000-98 was a threat to personnel safety and immediately terminated them with small arms fire.
> 
> Recovery of the recording data was successfully carried out, although there was some corruption. Analysis of the on-board computer systems showed that the //SCPS Nautilus// had been taken to a maximum depth of 17,934 metres below sea level. Due to the unknown nature of the material coating the submersible, it was determined that the //Nautilus// would be dismantled and incinerated along with the remains of D-5000-98.
> 
> Following review of the recovered footage, it was determined that SCP-5000-B must be sealed. Construction of a reinforced containment seal to be fitted over SCP-5000-B is now underway.

[[tab Initial Events]]

**Incident 5000-40-R-12 Analysis:**

Construction of the SCP-5000-B Containment Seal was completed on the 19/01/2018 and was rapidly transported to SCP-5000-A where it was fitted over SCP-5000-B via drilled anchor points on the 21/01/2018. Site 40-R reported the operation a success and resumed monitoring of SCP-5000-A at 13:28 hours.

At 01:48 hours on the 22/01/2018 Site 40-R ceased transmitting all signals to Site 40. Upon transmitting various messages and orders to Site 40-R, every device within Site 40 received the following email from the account of Dr. Steenstrup, who was lost in action during an early attempt to explore SCP-5000-B.

A small percentage of the staff receiving this email proceeded to undergo anomalous physical changes similar to those seen in D-5000-98. Surgery was able to save 85% of the affected individuals. A Site-wide network scrub was initiated, and it was determined that MTF Gamma-6 ("Deep Feeders") would be needed to re-establish contact with Site 40-R. Due to adverse weather conditions, it was not deemed safe to investigate Site 40-R until the 17/02/2018.

[[tab MTF Gamma-6 Investigation Log]]
**Investigation of Site 40-R:**

**Note:** The following events took place on the 17/02/2018, resulting in the worst losses MTF Gamma-6 ("Deep Feeders") have experienced since 1984. The footage itself was obtained from the body camera of Cpt. ██████ Wallace, one of two survivors of the expedition to Site 40-R. Extraneous detail and dialogue has been removed from this log.

> **{{[05:37:12]}}:** Aboard the marine transport, footage shows the approach to Site 40-R. The site is seen to be heavily damaged and partially submerged, with multiple SCP-5000 instances resting upon it as they do on SCP-5000-A.
> 
> **{{[05:43:30]}}:** Closer inspection of the site from the water shows that both west facing support pillars have been buckled by a significant impact. Three large objects can be seen resting on top of the Site, and there is evidence of multiple now extinguished fires. The protective netting over the Site has been removed. The transport proceeds to moor itself by the water access station.
> 
> **{{[05:48:30]}}:** Initial examination of Site 40-R's exterior begins. Massive structural damage can be seen, with the three large objects appearing to have caused most of this damage. Closer examination of these objects shows these to be the Containment Seal previously fitted over SCP-5000-B. These sections of the seal appear to have been broken apart via massive physical force. Each segment is coated with a thick organic material, from which multiple large eyes were growing. This material is seen to have spread across much of the exterior surface of Site 40-R, and the eyes growing from it can be seen tracking the task forces movements.
> 
> **{{[06:13:27]}}:** MTF enters the site via Corridor 12-B. An examination of an information terminal is conducted, showing that the Site is running on reserve power only, with the reactor having been shut off by automated systems to avoid a meltdown. Continued searching of the Site shows more organic matter growing within the corridor. No On-site personnel are located and the decision to move the search to Level Six[[footnote]] Housing the Main command center, Security, Medical and residential facilities. [[/footnote]] of the Site is made.
> 
> **{{[06:34:03]}}:** Due to structural damage to the stairwells of the Site, use of maintenance tunnels was required to reach Level Six. This led the task force directly to the main command center, where multiple staff members were located. All had numerous large yellow eyes growing across their bodies and internal organs. In some cases individuals whose entire torso had been converted to one massive eye and adhered itself to a nearby surface were seen, whereas other individuals faces had been entirely replaced by a single large eye.
> 
> **{{[06:51:55]}}:** Further examination of Level Six was able to locate 82% of the Site's staff. All had been altered in the same manner as those found in the main command center. The majority of these individuals remained seated or reclined, though some stood or would move throughout the Site. While the eyes growing from these individuals were observed to track the task force, none of the staff responded or interacted with MTF members in any way.
> 
> **{{[07:09:23]}}:** Continuing the search, it was discovered that the stairwell and maintenance tunnels leading to Level Seven[[footnote]] Main research and Containment facilities [[/footnote]] were inaccessible. Analysing the lower level with remote scanners showed that there was no seawater present in Level Seven, and that the main containment facility was several degrees warmer than the surrounding environment. The decision was made to cut through to the containment facility and rappel down.
> 
> **{{[07:52:15]}}:** Footage shows that the main containment facility is largely undamaged save for a large breach in the floor, through which an extremely large black tentacle had entered. The tentacle was coiled around the walls of the chamber before allowing its end to hang freely in the air from the ceiling. Its entire surface was covered in spiralling rows of large eyes, before terminating in a large fleshy mass resembling elements of human, cetacean, reptillian and fish anatomy. The remaining staff members could be seen having arranged themselves into a spiral formation around the end of this tentacle, and were proceeding to enter an opening at the tip in single file. These staff members had undergone similar alterations as those found on Level Six to varying degrees.
> 
> **{{[07:55:27]}}:** The MTF successfully enters Level Seven and proceeds to survey the room. Breathing apparatuses are readied in anticipation of potential flooding. At this point Sgt. ███ Hoctor attempts to communicate with a less altered staff member, resulting in the task force being attacked en masse by all of the affected individuals. 
> 
> **{{[07:58:58]}}:** All members of MTF Gamma-6 ("Deep Feeders") engage the affected staff with automatic weapons. On multiple occasions it can be seen that altered staff fail to die until the destruction of anomalous ocular growths is achieved. Pvt. ███████ Wheatley is non-fatally wounded and all remaining anomalously affected staff were successfully terminated. 
> 
> **{{[08:07:46]}}:** Pvt. Wheatley's injuries are treated. Several MTF members are examining the bodies of the deceased when the tentacle begins to violently attack the team. Sgt. Hoctor, Pvt. Royce, Pvt. Trujillo, and Pvt. Crahan are immediately closest to the tentacle and are either thrown into the walls or crushed beneath the tentacle. The rest of the MTF retreat to the security station and fire upon the tentacle. A distress call was made to Site 40, who proceeded to dispatch a rescue helicopter to Site 40-R. After several attempts to enter the security station, the tentacle then proceeded to exit the chamber, causing rapid flooding. The MTF was forced to equip their breathing apparatuses and abandon Pvt. Wheatley to retreat via the breach. 
> 
> **{{[08:08:03]}}:** Upon exiting Site 40-R, between sixteen and thirty tentacles believed to belong to SCP-5000-C can be seen emerging from the sea floor. Cpt. Wallace can be seen instructing the remaining MTF members to proceed to the submerged scaffolding and to surface before following personally. Sgt. Fehn and Pvt. Schneider can be seen being grabbed by SCP-5000-C and rapidly pulled into deep water, with the tentacles not reacting to the resulting weapons fire in any way.
> 
> **{{[08:08:42]}}:** The MTF reaches the scaffolding and proceeds to ascend toward the surface. Near the surface a large tentacle an estimated seventeen metres in diameter wraps around the entire support column, crushing Pvt. Anders, Sgt. Davis and Pvt. Bredl. Cpt. Wallace and Pvt. Taylor successfully reach the surface and proceed to Corridor 12-B to await rescue.
> 
> **{{[08:56:19]}}:** Three large tentacles are seen lifting the marine transport from the water before throwing it several hundred metres out to sea, where waves force it to be grounded on SCP-5000-A. No more tentacles are seen after this point.
> 
> **{{[09:28:23]}}:** Cpt. Wallace complains of physical discomfort, and proceeds to women’s restroom 12-B and examines herself in the mirror. Clusters of yellow eyes can be seen emerging from her left shoulder, chest and arm and cheek. Cpt. Wallace expresses distress and returns to Pvt. Taylor, who is displaying similar symptoms.
> 
> **{{[11:15:56]}}:** Cpt. Wallace and Pvt. Taylor are successfully recovered via rescue helicopter and returned to Site-40.

**Afterword:**
Both Cpt. Wallace and Pvt. Taylor were able to be saved through extensive surgery removing the anomalous growths, and received commendations for their efforts. It was advised that Site 40-R would be repaired and restaffed. these repairs were completed on the 27/10/2018 without incident, with observation and research of SCP-5000-A,B and C has proceeding smoothly. Site 40-R has resumed the management of Containing of SCP-5000, and no further sightings of SCP-5000-C have been reported.

[[tab Site 40-R Recovered Footage]]

**Analysis of footage recovered from Site 40-R:**

**Note:**
Following the repair and restaffing of Site 40-R, security footage was recovered from on-site servers. This footage required extensive reconstruction, and shed new light on the events of Incident 5000-40-R-12. Following the review of this footage, it was decided that no further efforts to seal SCP-5000-B would be made. A transcript of the recovered footage follows.

> **01:45 hours:** Poor visibility limits the camera's field of vision. Conditions are stormy, and the majority of the visible footage shows the exterior of Site 40-R. A patrol ship can be seen circling SCP-5000-A. The vessels search light is focused on the Containment Seal over SCP-5000-B. There is a series of extremely loud bangs coming from SCP-5000-B, and the containment seal can be seen buckling outwards.
> **01:46 hours:** Containment Seal ruptures. Five large tentacles presumed to belong to SCP-5000-C can be seen emerging from the breach in the Containment Seal, running around its edges and working at prying it from SCP-5000-A. The patrol vessel can be seen opening fire upon the tentacles. Three SCP-5000 instances proceed to lift the vessel into the air before depositing it on SCP-5000-A. A sixth tentacle is seen to emerge from SCP-5000-B before proceeding to seize the vessel and drag it within SCP-5000-B.
> **01:47 hours:** The tentacles emerging from SCP-5000-B manage to rip a section of the Containment Seal from its housing and proceeds to throw it at Site 40-R. This impacts out of frame, and the on-site emergency lighting and alarms activate. Numerous SCP-5000 instances can be seen approaching the Site and removing the protective netting from the structure. Multiple Foundation watercraft are seen departing from the Site towards SCP-5000-A, but are each pulled below the surface of the water by large tentacles before they can reach it.
> **01:48 hours:** Foundation security can be seen engaging the SCP-5000 instances with on-site weaponry, but are largely ignored. SCP-5000-C manages to remove the remaining sections of the Containment Seal and proceeds to throw them at Site 40-R. One of these can be seen impacting the radio communications tower, and the Site now has multiple fires burning across its exterior.
> **01:49 hours:** Multiple SCP-5000-C tentacles can be seen entering frame and attacking the on-site security, forcing a retreat within the site. These tentacles can be seen entering the site via various access points. At this point the cameras view begins to tilt as the sites support pillars buckle under the additional weight of the Containment Seal.

**Afterword:** 
Due to the nature of this attack, the behaviour of SCP-5000 instances throughout the event, and the subsequent lack of activity from SCP-5000-C, it is now believed that this incident was a direct result of SCP-5000'B's sealing. Additionally, the lack of further activity or sightings of SCP-5000-C has led the Foundation to believe that the entity either no longer remembers or no longer regards the Foundation as an enemy.

[[tab Note From 05-4]]
> //I would first like to begin by stating that what happened to site 40-R is a tragedy. We lost hundreds of good people. Friends, relatives and co-workers inhabited Site 40-R. Many had families, and all are deeply missed.//
> 
> //Rumours have been circulating around the events of Incident 5000-40-R-12, specifically in regards to the belief that the 05 Council does not care about these losses, and that we are too cowardly to terminate the entity responsible.//
> //While simply washing off the blood, bodies and ichor and putting this site back into action rather than avenging ourselves upon the entity that wounded us seems callous, it is imperative to keep in mind that this was just a reaction.//
> 
> //SCP-5000-C is just an animal. Perhaps not even that. All evidence we have gathered thus far indicates a significant lack of intelligence and a simple desire to observe the world around it. More importantly, this is all we know about this entity.// 
> //The bottom line is that we believe that this event is over. There is no need to waste resources in constructing a new site, or in attempting to destroy the entity. We are the Foundation after all, not the Global Occult Coalition.//
> 
> //We do regret these losses, but to give into fear would be an injustice to their memories. We will continue to do research. We will continue to explore the reef and the pit. We will learn what SCP-5000-C is.// 
> 
> //And when we know all there is to know about SCP-5000-C, we can lock it up and throw away the key.//
