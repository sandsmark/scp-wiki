[[tab Who The Hell Is This, Anyway?]]

AbsentmindedNihilist, or Niles for the lazy of fingers, is that irritating gay nerd who's always in chat. Claim to --fame-- infamy: the tale series colloquially known as lesbian hunger doggo.

Niles was raised by a family of Cambridge liberals who think Hillary doesn't go far enough --Elizabeth Warren should have run for president she's the candidate we all deserve-- who disparage her for selling out by joining "Big Containment." They would have much rather she joined the Serpent's Hand, but they don't offer insurance that covers her vast array of psychopharmaceutical prescriptions.

She has been involved in the containment of [[[SCP-2376]]], [[[SCP-810-J]]], [[[SCP-2916]]], and [[[SCP-2547]]], as well as documenting the history of the torrid affair between SCP-5760 and one Lakshmi Agarwal in the following documents: [[[Whoa, Here She Comes]]], [[[Show You What All That Howl Is For]]], [[[The Beast You've Made Of Me]]], [[[I Keep The Wolf From The Door]]], and [[[I Slip, I'm Still An Animal]]].

[[[SCP-2376]]] (currently +55)

> In particular, the Special Containment Procedures are well-crafted, as well. I've always felt that the Special Containment Procedures are a great tool to force the reader to interact with the object before knowing what it is. As a result, curiosity about what could possibly require these precautions is heightened. These do an excellent job at just that. //-WrongJohnSilver//

> Creeped me out when you were writing about it, creeps me out now. Terrifying. //-DrMagnus//

SCP-2376 was my second skip and my first successful one. In essence, it's a disease that makes other people think you're a scarecrow. The seed of the idea came from the line in the containment procedures where it mentions that the medical staff treating SCP-2376 patients must be frequently reminded that they're treating human beings. I imagined being in a hospital in awful pain, with everyone around you treating you like you aren't even there. Treatment is so close and yet so far. It's meant to be a symbiotic relationship with crows and the pathogen - the disease spreads, crows get an immobile, defenseless food source. Also - the city where the mannequin version of the disease pops up? Chicago. Think about that for a minute.

People seemed to enjoy this one a lot. People thought the body horror was good but not overdone, and that the use of fridge horror was well-done. I'm very proud of it, myself.

[[[SCP-2916]]]

A love story in the world of metafiction.
 
Altered a lot since its original posting. 

Originally a somewhat altered version of the very first skip I posted - a girl running away from a parent who could follow her due to powers.

Guess who has mommy issues. Not that I hid it well. Eventually, it evolved into something a much richer and more mythical - a tale about archetypes, and stories, and the power they hold over us, and the consequences of what happens when a myth doesn't end the way we expect. 

Oh, and there's lesbians. As usual.

[[[SCP-810-J]]]

I've always loved stuff where it's a long nonsensical buildup to a ridiculous pun (feghoot was a word I needed desperately). Finally, my time has come.

[[collapsible show="SCP-2547"]]

[[[SCP-2547]]]

You've seen hunger doggos. You've seen money doggos. You've seen narrative doggos. Now, get ready for THIRST doggos.

Fun facts: 

The album is a collaboration between Justin Vernon and Kanye West. 

2547-1 is such a perv because mythical Coyote's penis would detach while he was sleeping and seek out things to fuck. 

Oh, mythology.

Ah, yes. The infamous lesbian hunger doggo. The bane of poor Kalinin's existence. Described by Dr. Kens as damn good. Described by weizhong and multiple others as the weirdest thing they've ever read on the site. Almost got me banned from chat for posting the beginning of Part 3 (which was, btw, written by a very drunk Meyers) without an NSFW tag. Good times. 

I wanted to do a piece about a researcher who's ex turned out to be a skip. I'd taken bits and pieces of several unposted drafts and combined them into this unholy monstrosity. I thought I would be struggling to keep this from dipping into the negatives; both tales are above 20 (again, sorry Kalinin). 

If I become famous for anything on the site, I hope to hell it's this.

AveryxLakshmi = OTP.

Also - if you want to know what Lakshmi looks like, picture a sleep-deprived, exasperated Priyanka Chopra in a lab coat and glasses.
