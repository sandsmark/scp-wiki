[[tab Who The Hell Is This, Anyway?]]

AbsentmindedNihilist, or Niles for the lazy of fingers, is that irritating gay nerd who's always in chat. Claim to --fame-- infamy: the tale series colloquially known as lesbian hunger doggo.

Niles was raised by a family of Cambridge liberals who think Hillary doesn't go far enough --Elizabeth Warren should have run for president she's the candidate we all deserve-- who disparage her for selling out by joining "Big Containment." They would have much rather she joined the Serpent's Hand, but they don't offer insurance that covers her vast array of psychopharmaceutical prescriptions.

She has been involved in the containment of [[[SCP-2376]]], [[[SCP-3240]]], [[[SCP-2574]]], [[[SCP-2952]]], [[[SCP-810-J]]], [[[SCP-729-J]]], [[[SCP-2709]]], [[[SCP-3807}]]], [[[SCP-2916]]], [[[SCP-4698]]], [[[SCP-2889]]], and [[[SCP-2547]]], as well as documenting the history of the torrid affair between SCP-5760 and one Lakshmi Agarwal in the following documents: [[[Whoa, Here She Comes]]], [[[Show You What All That Howl Is For]]], [[[The Beast You've Made Of Me]]], [[[I Keep The Wolf From The Door]]], and [[[I Slip, I'm Still An Animal]]]. Also included is the tale [[[And Then It Was Morning]]] depicting the slow and prolonged death of an adorable skip. Don't say I didn't warn you.

**Drinking Game:**

For the most authentic Niles experience, drink cream soda or iced tea from a flask instead of any real alcohol, but give no indication that it is not alcohol. Proceed to intimidate everyone else.

If an SCP that resembles one organism is genetically similar to another organism, take a sip.

If there's an excursion into a creepy forest, take two sips.

If a canine creature appears or is referenced, finish your drink.

Take two sips if characters indicate that they are not straight.

Finish your drink if there is cross species attraction. 

Take a sip for an edgy title.

Take two sips for neuroscience geekery.

Take a shot for no use of [DATA EXPUNGED].

Take a shot for mythology references.

[[tab Author Commentary]]

[[collapsible show="SCP-2376"]]

[[[SCP-2376]]] (currently +55)

> In particular, the Special Containment Procedures are well-crafted, as well. I've always felt that the Special Containment Procedures are a great tool to force the reader to interact with the object before knowing what it is. As a result, curiosity about what could possibly require these precautions is heightened. These do an excellent job at just that. //-WrongJohnSilver//

> Terrific fridge horror with the mental image of the father crucifying his son. //-A Random Day//

> Creeped me out when you were writing about it, creeps me out now. Terrifying. //-DrMagnus//

SCP-2376 was my second skip and my first successful one. In essence, it's a disease that makes other people think you're a scarecrow. The seed of the idea came from the line in the containment procedures where it mentions that the medical staff treating SCP-2376 patients must be frequently reminded that they're treating human beings. I imagined being in a hospital in awful pain, with everyone around you treating you like you aren't even there. Treatment is so close and yet so far. It's meant to be a symbiotic relationship with crows and the pathogen - the disease spreads, crows get an immobile, defenseless food source. Also - the city where the mannequin version of the disease pops up? Chicago. Think about that for a minute.

People seemed to enjoy this one a lot. People thought the body horror was good but not overdone, and that the use of fridge horror was well-done. I'm very proud of it, myself.

A love story in the world of metafiction.
 
Altered a lot since its original posting. 

Originally a somewhat altered version of the very first skip I posted - a girl running away from a parent who could follow her due to powers.

Guess who has mommy issues. Not that I hid it well. Eventually, it evolved into something a much richer and more mythical - a tale about archetypes, and stories, and the power they hold over us, and the consequences of what happens when a myth doesn't end the way we expect. 

Oh, and there's lesbians. As usual.

> See I was wondering how this managed to hit +10 in the ten minutes before I got to it, but then I read it and I can definitely see why. It's cool to see a modern implementation of a mythological figure that shows it adapting to its present circumstances, especially one that works so well with such a dumb punny title. -//Communism will win//

> Absolutely wonderful. And, at least with what I know from my boyfriend, the aspect of the return to prominence is accurate to a lot of Native myth as well. - //ProcyonLotor//

> This reminds me of American Gods in a good way. I really like any fiction that has gods trying to return to prominence, and Small Town Furry Evangelist was a take I didn't expect to enjoy this much. +1, for someone who claims not to be a furry you sure do write some entertaining anthropomorphic creatures, clearly you've wasted your talents on the wrong fandoms :P - //DrArmstrong//

You've seen hunger doggos. You've seen money doggos. You've seen narrative doggos. Now, get ready for THIRST doggos.

This was one of my ideas that came from a "seed:" namely, in this case, the image of a bipedal coyote wearing a leather jacket and crucifix, surrounded by human and canine followers, vomiting up water.

I worked very hard to maintain both the Wild West imagery and the story of a mythological figure using the religions that have replaced him to return to prominence. 

And then I decided to say fuck it, and make him the real Coyote. 

I liked the Desert Grassroots protocol quite a lot, and I got to play with all the different ideas of character and story, which I think, in combination with the Reverend's...distinctive personality, made this article my most popular. That and the pandering to furries.

Fun facts: 

The album is a collaboration between Justin Vernon and Kanye West. 

2547-1 is such a perv because mythical Coyote's penis would detach while he was sleeping and seek out things to fuck. 

Oh, mythology.

I've always wanted to write a skip about bath bombs. My favorite bath bomb is the Guardian of the Forest bath bomb, which features cypress oil. Salvagebar linked me to the myth or Cyparissus, and then I ended up incorporating aspects of a dream I had into the final log.

Ah, yes. The infamous lesbian hunger doggo. The bane of poor Kalinin's existence. Described by Dr. Kens as damn good. Described by weizhong and multiple others as the weirdest thing they've ever read on the site. Almost got me banned from chat for posting the beginning of Part 3 (which was, btw, written by a very drunk Meyers) without an NSFW tag. Good times. 

I wanted to do a piece about a researcher who's ex turned out to be a skip. I'd taken bits and pieces of several unposted drafts and combined them into this unholy monstrosity. I thought I would be struggling to keep this from dipping into the negatives; now all tales are above 30 (again, sorry Kalinin). 

If I become famous for anything on the site, I hope to hell it's this.

> "Wow. That's the first well-executed horror on this site that I can recall actually being unsettled by in… I don't know how long. And you managed to do it with a giant antlion larva. Well done. - //Communism Will Win//

> The expedition did it for me. No one should underestimate how hard it is to create characters like that. Very well done. - //Leveritas//

I thought I couldn't have an edgier title than Crow's Revenge. Nope! But hey, let's look on the bright side: I managed to include a spray can flame thrower. And have it MAKE SENSE IN CONTEXT (sorry, Shaggy!). I have peaked. 

My main regret here - haven't figured out how to hold the suspense while having the info about the thing itself be not in the article. 

Based on a weird incident that happened to me when I was home alone: my dog, who never barks, began barking at something in the forest near my home - as did every other dog in the neighbourhood. Amidst the barks, I heard something like a laugh… Later learned it was probably a coyote, but the image of every animals going crazy at the presence of something just stuck with me.

And then I decided to make it into an antlion, because AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA. {People. Eat. Those things. WHY.)

Some explanation: 
Humans aren't immune to its effects because they're stronger than it - we're not stronger than it. They specifically aren't affected by it because their evolutionary innate fear of it is being suppressed by our frontal cortices. As such, it preys upon us specifically. But someone with an altered brain structure - like Phineas Gage, whos frontal cortex was destroyed, or someone with sufficiently severe anxiety/paranoia... their amygdala is able to send that "GTFO" signal. It's survived for so long on a human-only diet because humans like to send large parties after scary monsters. Whoops. 

All the animals are trying to warn the humans in order to starve it and allow them to live in safety.

This was almost an 001, until it wasn't. Now it's here. I did The Second Coming for a poetry competition in school, and the imagery possessed me so powerfully i knew I had to write a skip about it. 

Definitely the most laborious skip of all the ones I've written: this one took AGES.

Bc fairies used to ride corgis into battle, and the idea of corg transportation just wouldn't leave me alone.

Apparently people enjoyed this one? There's already a CAH card for it, apparently.

Added the log at the suggestion of Soulless. 

The corg is named after SpectralDragon's doggo, who is as much of a lazy food-oriented sausage as my own doggo.

Also seems to be doing well on the reddit!
