**Item #:** SCP-2464

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Restricted access to SCP-2464-1 is to be maintained via 5 checkpoint stations (designated Area 2464-1 through -5) spaced roughly 5 km apart from each other throughout the primary mine (Provisional Site-2464) access tunnel. Access into Area 2464-5 is only to be granted to individuals with Level 4 clearance, or the members of authorized exploration/maintenance teams. Individuals gain access past Area-2464-1 are to be contained, brought to Site 81 for examination, and subsequently administered Class D amnestics or terminated.

The stone slab separating SCP-2464-1 from Area-2464-5 is to be kept in place at all times, except in the event of scheduled exploration or to provide maintenance to SCP-2464-4. Should SCP-2464-2 breach containment, preset charges along the main access tunnel of Site-2464 are to be detonated and the tunnel is to be collapsed. If SCP-2464-2 is able to escape the collapsed tunnel, the on-site nuclear device is to be detonated below the current location of Provisional Site-2464. 

Maintenance of SCP-2464-4 is the primary concern in regards to continued containment of SCP-2464-2. Research into the design and function of SCP-2464-4 is ongoing, and should be considered the top priority. Under no circumstances, even during maintenance of SCP-2464-4, should SCP-2464-2 and SCP-2464-3 be disturbed in any way.

**Description:** SCP-2464-1 is a temporal and spatial anomaly existing within the Morris Limestone Mine located near the town of ████████████, Indiana. SCP-2464-1 is only accessible through the removal of a large stone slab that covers its only entrance, and other methods of attempting to access SCP-2464-1 have proven unsuccessful. Cutting into the space where SCP-2464-1 should be located reveals only solid limestone.

The interior of SCP-2464-1 usually appears to be a large, open field of rolling hills that extends indefinitely in all directions, although the setting is subject to rapid change[[footnote]]Due to the rapid nature of these shifts, attempts to cross SCP-2464-1 are particularly treacherous, as seen when an entire maintenance team was lost after SCP-2464-1 shifted, trapping the team below an ice sheet.[[/footnote]]. Situated roughly 50m in front of the entrance to SCP-2464-1 is a 1960's American farmhouse in a state of advanced disrepair, which will remain constant despite shifts in the appearance of SCP-2464-1. Analysis of plant matter within SCP-2464-1 has revealed no unknown or foreign biological substances. Explorations attempting to find an end to SCP-2464-1's spatial disparity have been inconclusive; while SCP-2464-1 does appear to be an infinite space, certain physical and chemical disruptions begin to appear as one travels further and further away from SCP-2464-2. The "sun" within SCP-2464-1 is perpetually situated at dusk.

Two anomalous entities and one anomalous machine are contained within the farmhouse. Both are located in the 2nd floor master bedroom, which itself contains only a bed, SCP-2464-2, SCP-2464-3, and SCP-2464-4. 

**SCP-2464-2** is a human female, aged at approximately 12 years. SCP-2464-2 is roughly  1.4m in height, with brown hair that appears to have not been cut for several years. Eye color cannot currently be determined.  and is situated on the bed within the 2nd floor master bedroom. SCP-2464-2 is perpetually open-mouthed, but otherwise unmoving and unresponsive, likely due to the effects of SCP-2464-3 and -4. SCP-2464-2 is held to the bed by shackles located on its wrists and ankles, although all are severely rusted. For more information on SCP-2464-2, please see Addendum 2464-2X.

**SCP-2464-3** is the identical twin sister of SCP-2464-2. SCP-2464-3 is suspended on the ceiling above SCP-2464-2 by a series of iron clasps around the knees, ankles, elbows, wrists, and torso. SCP-2464-3 is similarly unresponsive, likely because of the effects of SCP-2464-4. SCP-2464-3 is extremely emaciated, and constantly secretes a viscous black liquid through its mouth, which falls into the open mouth of SCP-2464-2. The source of this liquid is currently unknown.

**SCP-2464-4** is a machine designed and constructed by the late Dr. Michael Banning. It is situated within the 2nd floor master bedroom, against the north-facing wall. SCP-2464-4 consists of a main hub and a number of copper tubes which run up the wall and towards SCP-2464-3. These tubes all enter SCP-2464-3 via copper access ports on its right side, just below the armpit. Additionally, a number of biological components have been discovered at various locations throughout the apparatus, although their purpose is currently unknown. The entirety of SCP-2464-4 is in a state of disrepair, and is the subject of an ongoing attempt to fully restore the entire mechanism.

The apparent purpose of SCP-2464-4 is as a means of extending the lifespan of SCP-2464-3 by means of preventing SCP-2464-3 from aging. While this process appears to have been thusfar effective, an apparent side effect is the degeneration of the cell tissues of SCP-2464-3, resulting in a number of cancers appearing throughout the body. While the rate of expansion of these cancers has been kept to a minimum by SCP-2464-4, due to the machine's state of disrepair, current models predict SCP-2464 will be unable to sustain its current processes for longer than an additional 10 years without repair, likely resulting in the expiration of SCP-2464-3.

**Addendum 2464-2X:** INFORMATION RESTRICTED TO LEVEL 4 PERSONNEL OR ABOVE
[[collapsible show="+ INPUT CREDENTIALS" hide="- CREDENTIALS ACCEPTED"]]
It is currently believed that SCP-2464-2 is a Class V Reality Bending Entity, and that the entirety of SCP-2464-1, outside of the existence of SCP-2464-3 and SCP-2464-4, are a result of that nature. Although SCP-2464-2 has not shown any evidence of reality bending during the its time within Foundation containment, the presence of the spatial anomaly, coupled with the information gathered from Dr. Banning's personal files, it is presumed that the function of SCP-2464-3 was as a means by which to lock SCP-2464-2 in a stasis, within which it would be unable to utilize its anomalous characteristics. Despite this, it also seems as if SCP-2464-2 is capable of bending reality subconsciously, resulting in the creation of SCP-2464-1 and its dramatic shifts in appearance. 

It is also currently believed that, were SCP-2464-4 to malfunction and SCP-2464-3 to expire as a result, SCP-2464-2 would be released from its current stasis. Given the information gathered from Dr. Banning's logs, it is well within the realm of possibility that this event could trigger an RK-Class "Reality Restructuring" scenario, by means of SCP-2464-2's out of control reality disruptions.

> //It is the opinion of both myself, and the Classification Council, that despite having observed no outwardly hazardous qualities of SCP-2464, it must be classified as Keter. The reasoning for this is simple; after thorough dissection of Dr. Banning's logs, especially where they relate to his daughters Olivia and Mary, our summation of SCP-2464-2 is that it is, in fact, a remarkably powerful reality bender. Several abnormal events, which were once that to be freak occurrences or the result of other SCP objects, have now been found to have originated from SCP-2464-2.//
> 
> //However, given the deteriorating mental state of SCP-2464-2 at the time of its containment, it is unknown how dangerous this entity might be. Studies into the minds of Class V entities are few and far between, entirely because of the difficulty in finding and containing these entities. It is entirely possible that, given the documented mental health issues that Dr. Banning observed in SCP-2464-2, it would be harmless outside of stasis, being unable to function at all. Inversely, it is also possible that, by being unable to fully understand and manage its ability to bend reality, SCP-2464-2 could devastate much of the American mid-west in a matter of hours. All of this is left to speculation, and as such, we must assume the worst.//
> 
> //As a matter of personal note, I do not envy the decision Dr. Banning had to make. To be forced to destroy one daughter to keep the other from becoming a monster? As a father, it is simply unthinkable. But in the pursuit of our goal, what must we let stand in our way? What must we deem more precious to us? The answer, simply, is nothing.//
