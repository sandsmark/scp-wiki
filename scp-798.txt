**Item #:** SCP-798

**Object Class:** Safe
 
**Special Containment Procedures:** --SCP-798 requires no specialised constraints or protocols and is currently housed in a 80 cm by 60 cm cage on a wooden table.--

**Retraction:** No personnel should approach SCP-798 alone. SCP-798’s cage is to be kept secure within a low-level cell. 

**Description:** SCP-798 resembles a healthy adult grey/beige rat. SCP-798’s dietary requirements, sleep patterns, and metabolism are normal for //rattus norvegicus//. Blood tests confirm that it belongs to this genus.

SCP-798 has, however, demonstrated signs of heightened intelligence, engaging in behaviours usually associated with corvidae or higher mammals; self-awareness, problem solving, and even limited tool use. SCP-798 possesses the ability to influence other animals from a distance and even control them if allowed to establish physical contact. The SCP’s abilities have proven far less potent when used on cetaceans, corvidae, or primates, to the point that 798 appears incapable of linking with such subjects. 

**Addendum:** X-rays, CRT scans, and [DATA EXPUNGED] indicate that 798 is a normal rat, and no heightened electrical, chemical, or neurological activity has ever been observed in either SCP-798 or any of its targets.

**Log 798-1:**
Request access to Incident Report ███ for further information.

**Log 798-2:**
**Researchers:** Agents ██████ and ████
**Procedure:** Routine observation of SCP-798.
**Details:** SCP-798 preened itself, rearranged its bedding, and began eating. Partway through its meal it stopped and began staring intently at Agent ██████. Agent ██████ slowly got up and reached towards the cage, announcing his intent to let the “little guy run around a bit”. Agent ████ stopped him by grabbing his arm and addressing him directly. 

**Addendum 798-2.1:** Agent ██████‘s experiences imply that SCP-798 can assert a psychological effect on those in close proximity to it. Repeats of this experiment indicate that this effect is easily overcome through application of willpower and/or the subject’s awareness that they are being manipulated. Mostly SCP-798’s subconscious broadcasts are requests for freedom or more food, although it has proved capable of making researchers feel intense guilt during procedures such as shock therapy or blood sampling.

**Log 798-3:**
**Researchers:** Agents ██████ and ████
**Procedure:** SCP-798 was left alone with a housecat belonging to Agent ████.
**Details:** The cat immediately jumped up onto the SCP’s table and began to nudge the cage off, where it struck the ground, dislodging the holding pin. Once 798 had been released, the cat prostrated itself and allowed SCP-798 to [DATA EXPUNGED]
