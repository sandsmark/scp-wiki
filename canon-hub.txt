title:Canon Hub
The idea that there is no canon is a bit silly at times. It's not that we don't have any. It's that we have a multitude which touch, cross, and dip into each other. It's up to you, as the reader, to decide what you believe and what you embrace as the heart of the universe. That doesn't mean, though, that authors lack intent or design, and collaboration is the heart of innovation.

Collected below are links to the recognized, shared canons of the SCP Foundation Universe. To write in one, you should make sure that you read the other material from that canon and try to remember that these things are connected. If you're interested in forming your own canon, read the information at the bottom of the page.

There is a whole new war here, a new type of war, industrial and implacable. The American war machine has become unrecognizable.

Out in the jungle bear-clawed women hunt the Viet Cong through their own tunnels for hours before emerging. Airborne commandos on interdiction patrols carry weapons which calcify their targets in the blink of an eye. Villages suspected of sheltering the enemy are plastered in napalm that collects itself into a moving mass of fire and waits for survivors to emerge from cover before flaring back into life...

The world sucks. No, really, it does. But //we// don't have to suck just because the world sucks. We can make the world a better place. It's cliche, but it's true. And Wondertainment is trying to do just that, one step at a time.

Judy pulled the safety bar off of herself, grabbed her backpack from the luggage compartment on the side of the massive worm-like vehicle, and then struck up a cheery step while emerging into the assault on the senses that was Wonder World!™ proper! The buildings dived and swam and bubbled to create all shapes but what supposed normal buildings looked like, instead opting for archways and gem-like structures, things that looked like they were built from yarn, glass orbs with little to no foundations, and all different assortments of Dali-esque abstractions.

The discovery of an ancient anomaly upends the balance between the anomalous and the Foundation. As Humanity becomes a race of gods and global order falls, the Foundation and its enemies must decide how much they're willing to sacrifice to achieve their ideals.

Magic has infinite manifestations, sources, and rules, none of which universally apply. Except one. Everything has a cost. Nothing is free. Humanity is ascending, perhaps all the way to godhood. What price will be asked of us for this? What will happen when we can't afford to pay it?

Between the gunslingers, the snakes, and the anomalies, there's a good chance you might die in the old west. But there's also a chance you'll find your fortune. Don't matter much. Just put your money on the table and play the hand you're dealt.

The union has seen fit to give the survivors of the Razing a sum of 50 dollars and the promise of land in the west. I will myself go there to find my fortune or my death. As I enter this new period of my life, I would like to thank you for your patronage. If you are to ever find yourself in Riddle, Wyoming, pass me by without a word. I do not wish to be reminded of this chapter of my life.

[[collapsible show="So You Wanna Build A Canon" hide="Hide Instructions"]]

If you're wanting to build a canon and have it added to this page, the important thing to remember is that it must be a shared project. To qualify for inclusion here, your canon must meet the following requirements:

* A minimum of five articles written.
* A minimum of three authors writing the articles.
* Your canon cannot be "closed" to other, new contributors.
* Your canon cannot be "finished."

We're not going to split hairs on this either. Remember: collaboration and innovation. That is the purpose of these creations. If you have any questions, contact an administrator.
