The idea that there is no canon is a bit silly at times. It's not that we don't have any. It's that we have a multitude which touch, cross, and dip into each other. It's up to you, as the reader, to decide what you believe and what you embrace as the heart of the universe. That doesn't mean, though, that authors lack intent or design, and collaboration is the heart of innovation.

Collected below are links to the recognized, shared canons of the SCP Foundation Universe. To write in one, you should make sure that you read the other material from that canon and try to remember that these things are connected. If you're interested in forming your own canon, read the information at the bottom of the page.

She can list what you'd find in 86235 Holt — all the frozen water and organic-rich silicates — without batting an eye. Several minutes ago she did just that.

"There were eighteen of us on that ship- Twelve from the Foundation, six from the GOC. Eleven came back, four of those, myself included, in need of serious medical treatment. Two died in hospital on Minerva Base. The Fyodorov had a crew of 45, not including the captain. I don't know who gave the order to fire on the Nikolai Fyodorov. I know the flight recorder was damaged. I don't particularly care. They were right to do so."

Strange things are done in the Northwest Rains. From the extradimensional antics of Three Portlands, to the cybernetic reign of Anderson Robotics, to a bizarre partnership with Wilson's Wildlife Services, it's up to the fine folks of Site-64 to keep everything contained.

"She then turned her attention back to the sunset and took a deep breath. The smell of pine trees and sea salt filled her nostrils. In the distance, a group of people flew through the skyline on broomsticks. Nearby, a friendly looking pair of young men were putting on a magic show for a group of children, fantastic figures of light and sound dancing around for the little one’s amusement. Distant music could be heard among the hustle and bustle of people of all sorts enjoying the dying light."

Darryl Loyd wasn't a very inquisitive man by nature; he'd add that he'd never been, but he wasn't quite sure how much of his life he'd actually lived. Oh, fine, he was (usually) a researcher, and they were pretty inquisitive about science. After all, that's what researchers do: research. But when it came to the metaphysical questions that plagued his mind, like "am I me, or just a collection of my cells?", "how can one be moral in an existence where the only meaning in the universe is what one makes of it?", or "who created me, and how can I demand a refund?", Darryl Loyd preferred not to think about it too hard.

By the time we made it to Hy-Brasil, the city had already descended into chaos and ruin. The storm was bad enough to cause panic, and then a fire-breathing squid monster crawled out of the ocean. It was a recipe for disaster, and that is what happened.

The world sucks. No, really, it does. But //we// don't have to suck just because the world sucks. We can make the world a better place. It's cliche, but it's true. And Wondertainment is trying to do just that, one step at a time.

Judy pulled the safety bar off of herself, grabbed her backpack from the luggage compartment on the side of the massive worm-like vehicle, and then struck up a cheery step while emerging into the assault on the senses that was Wonder World!™ proper! The buildings dived and swam and bubbled to create all shapes but what supposed normal buildings looked like, instead opting for archways and gem-like structures, things that looked like they were built from yarn, glass orbs with little to no foundations, and all different assortments of Dali-esque abstractions.

[[collapsible show="So You Wanna Build A Canon" hide="Hide Instructions"]]

If you're wanting to build a canon and have it added to this page, the important thing to remember is that it must be a shared project. To qualify for inclusion here, your canon must meet the following requirements:

* A minimum of five articles written.
* A minimum of three authors writing the articles.
* Your canon cannot be "closed" to other, new contributors.
* Your canon cannot be "finished."

We're not going to split hairs on this either. Remember: collaboration and innovation. That is the purpose of these creations. If you have any questions, contact an administrator.

A quote or excerpt from one of the works that allows readers to get a good idea of what to expect from your canon. Preferably, this should be a clever, flavorful, or defining part of the piece instead of self aggrandizing.
