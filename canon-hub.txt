title:Canon Hub
> The idea that there is no canon is a bit silly at times. It's not that we don't have any. It's that we have a multitude which touch, cross, and dip into each other. It's up to you, as the reader, to decide what you believe and what you embrace as the heart of the universe. That doesn't mean, though, that authors lack intent or design, and collaboration is the heart of innovation.
> 
> Collected below are links to the recognized, shared canons of the SCP Foundation Universe. To write in one, you should make sure that you read the other material from that canon and try to remember that these things are connected. If you're interested in forming your own canon, read the information at the bottom of the page.

[[collapsible show="So You Wanna Build A Canon" hide="Hide This Text"]]

If you're wanting to build a canon and have it added to this page, the important thing to remember is that it must be a shared project. To qualify for inclusion here, your canon must meet the following requirements:

* A minimum of five tales written.
* A minimum of three authors writing the tales.
* Your canon cannot be "closed" to other, new contributors.
* Your canon cannot be "finished."

We're not going to split hairs on this either. Remember: collaboration and innovation. That is the purpose of these creations. IF you have any questions, contact an administrator. Currently, TroyL is heading up this project, so he'll be the first to try.
