**Item #:** SCP-3461

**Object Class:** Thaumiel

**Special Containment Procedures:** The development of SCP-3461 is a Class IX research priority.
 
O5-4 has been designated as the HMCL of SCP-3461, to coordinate all involved departments and approve cross-testing of relevant SCP objects. 

To facilitate SCP-3461-α, the Foundation Disinformation and Theology Departments are to receive  {{40%}} budget increases for the {{2046}} fiscal year.

The O5 Council has authorized the use of the [[[roget-s-proposal|PANDORA]]] Protocol to carry out SCP-3461-β.

Under the SCP-3461-γ initiative, a current total of {{021}} anomalies have been reclassified as Thaumiel-class, and a total of {{083}} anomalies have been reclassified as Maksur-class. A comprehensive list is available in Appendix-3461-γ.

The physical components of SCP-3461-δ are to be kept in dedicated, maximum-security containment facilities. No Foundation personnel, except for maintenance engineers with Level 5/3461 Clearance, are authorized to enter the components' respective containment chambers. Component-specific containment procedures are available on a need-to-know basis in Appendix-3461-δ.

Efforts to extend SCP-3461 to the civilian population are underway.

> //I'll keep things concise for now. This effort, while tangential to primary containment, is no less important. It is aligned with the Foundation's zeroth goal, and thus has its full backing.//

**Description:** SCP-3461 designates a multi-faceted Foundation project to engineer an afterlife hospitable to humankind.

SCP-3461-α is a worldwide implementation of the [[[Genius Loci]]] protocol, as to alter collective religious belief on life after death. The goal of SCP-3461-α is to increase the inclusivity/amiability of any possibly extant, Leibniz-class dimensions. This entails a mass-scale social engineering program, promoting belief in universal salvation (or equivalents) in the world's major religions. Foundation-funded theologians, implants in religious institutions, and grassroots religious movements are currently part of the program. As per the [[[scp-2217 | Triumvirate]]] agreement, the Foundation is obliged to help the Horizon Initiative in creating "The Universal Texts". Such efforts are to focus on advancing SCP-3461-α through the discovery and/or forgery of manuscripts that support this soteriological narrative. 

> //There is nothing sacred to the Foundation. Truth and falsehood are only as valuable as they are useful. What is happening here is no different than what has been done for decades, centuries, even millennia.// 
> 
> //It's a small comfort, I know. Even if you presuppose that the Foundation was just "discovering" and spreading the truth, the callousness at which it pays off great minds, manipulates masses, and forges scripture must weigh on the faithful among us. Nonetheless, we have a duty to look after the wellbeing of humanity in all of its forms. If it soothes your conscience, I advise that you consider it less so "doctoring" and more so "progressive revelation".//

> - Yusuf Zafarul, Theology Department Head

SCP-3461-β is the neutralization of all verified, inhospitable afterlives under Foundation purview. This serves to funnel human consciousnesses into Foundation-approved afterlives, created and maintained by the other components of SCP-3461. Under the PANDORA Protocol, the utilization of all assets available to the Foundation, including anomalous objects, is permitted to accomplish this objective.

SCP-3461-γ is MTF α-0 ("Fishers of Dead Men"), an esoteric taskforce composed primarily of Type VI Volitional Spiritual Apparitions. This main squadron is supplemented by a number of Pistiphagic, Tartarean, Infomorphic, or Ectomorphic Anomalous Entities serving as secondary assets. MTF α-0 is tasked with the neutralization of threats to SCP-3461, typically those that prey on human soulforms, offer type-6 geases, or inhabit Leibniz-class dimensions. A secondary function of the taskforce is to safeguard human soulforms until exit from baseline reality.

|| [[[SCP-3004]]] || PoI-6870's secondary anomalous properties, gained from the execution of Protocol Damnatio ad Bestias, make him suited for esoteric combat with Pistiphagic entities. PoI-6870's cooperation is contingent on non-interference treaty with GoI-████. ||
|| [[[SCP-3540]]] || SCP-3540-1 and SCP-3540-2 agree to act as intermediaries to similar psychopompic entities, provided that their containment protocols concerning halloween festivity are loosened. ||
|| [[[SCP-3899]]] || SCP-3899 has suspected psychopompic properties. All attempts at recruitment have failed. Attempts at termination are not advised. Low priority target.  ||
|| [[[SCP-4069]]] || SCP-4069-B, after conversation with the Administrator, offered its services to the Foundation. It has since neutralized SCP-3434 and SCP-4069. Refer to SCP-3461-δ for more details. ||
|| [[[SCP-4999]]] || Communication with SCP-4999 has been achieved. Attempts to enlist it have thus far stalled, but the subject appears amiable to civilian deployment of SCP-3461. ||

Alpha-Zero is emblematic of that change, enlisting anomalies we previously jailed, fighting entities we didn't even know how to classify before. And unlike certain other agencies, we're capable of coexisting with the anomalous, without drafting it or killing it. On top of all that, we're safeguarding Foundation personnel from entropy itself. Soon, all of humanity is going to bear that privilege.//

SCP-3461-δ refers to an artificial afterlife created by the Foundation, designed as to accommodate and comfort an arbitrarily large amount of human soulforms, indefinitely. Further details are restricted to Level 5/3461 personel.

|| [[[SCP-4069]]] || SCP-4069, having been modified by SCP-4069-B, serves as the dimensional substrate on which SCP-3461-δ is superimposed on. ||

> //I'm sure quite a few of you are on this page due to a recent amendment to the Level 4 benefits package: "Should you die while under Foundation employment, you may choose to donate your soul for use in experiments pertaining to the afterlife. All efforts will be made to prevent it coming to harm." Concise, I know. Justifiably, you'll have your reservations. But there are no strings attached, there is no twist. Upper management has decided that each human being is entitled to paradise, and thus set about to create an artificial, pleasant afterlife. Your spirit, should you entrust it to us, will be put in various states approximating eternal bliss. Should our specialists determine that something has damaged it, or should your post-mortem consciousness withdraw consent, we'll cease experimentation and let natural processes occur. You soul won't be kept in a vat, or fed to a dark elder god, or used in bargaining deals with demons.//

**The Foundation exists for the betterment for mankind.**

While our organization concerns itself with the preservation of normalcy, this is merely a means to an end. At the onset, we prided ourselves as a humanitarian effort. Doing good by keeping the natural order, maintaining a precarious peace. This holds true, but we didn't know the full scope this mission entailed.

It seemed like the more we advanced, the more daunting our duty was. As our numbers rose, so did theirs. The more we learned, the more we realized what we started out with didn't make sense.

**But we must keep mankind protected.** And we've now found ourselves in the position to do the ultimate good. 

I won't sweep aside the sacrifices and moral calculus that we've had to do, but this is the opportunity to to ensure the safety and sanity of every soul. We can make up for every wrong.
