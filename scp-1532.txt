**Item #:** SCP-1532

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** As the exact location of SCP-1532 is unknown, current containment procedures are focused on preventing public awareness of its capabilities. Mobile Task Force Gamma-5 (aka "They're on our side, Sir!") has created a media campaign informing the public that SCP-1532 is an illegal company guilty of mail fraud, and that all copies of SCP-1532-b should be turned over to the proper authorities as soon as possible. Any instances of SCP-1532-b are to be found and destroyed, and Class-C amnesiacs are to be given to any witnesses. Any suspected instances of SCP-1532-a found outside of Foundation custody are to be captured and tested to confirm or deny if they are SCP-1532-a. Confirmed instances of SCP-1532-a are to be kept for study or termination as necessary. Instances of SCP-1532-a may be tested in conjunction with other SCP objects by personnel with Level 5 clearance.

**Description:** SCP-1532 is an unknown facility that artificially creates and sells human beings. SCP-1532 will advertise itself by spontaneously generating catalogs (collectively referred to as SCP-1532-b) in the mailboxes of residential addresses across the U.S.A. and Canada. Tests of these catalogs show that they are not anomalous and are printed on normal rotogravure paper with ordinary printing ink. SCP-1532-b instructs the reader to create a human being by selecting a large number of available traits and writing them into the order form in the back of the catalog, then mailing it in using the included pre-paid envelope. Individual traits found in SCP-1532-b have specific prices, with the average purchase costing [REDACTED] per human purchased. Purchases can be paid for either by including cash with the order form or by writing in a credit card number on the form, in which case the appropriate amount of money will be removed from the bank account and transferred to an unknown destination. Tests have shown that SCP-1532 only accepts United States or Canadian dollars for cash payments, and will accept all major credit cards.

When an SCP-1532-b order form is properly filled out and placed in a mailbox, it spontaneously disappears within six hours of placement. Three to five weeks later a human being identical to the order placed (collectively referred to as SCP-1532-a) is delivered to the address of the sender by a blue van with the words “Dr. Gale’s Human Emporium©” painted on the side. The van spontaneously appears eight kilometers away from its destination, drops off an instance of SCP-1532-A, and then disappears after traveling another eight kilometers. All attempts to follow or track the van have failed.

Instances of SCP-1532-a appear physically indistinguishable to normal humans; however, they all share certain properties that make them possible to identify and locate. All instances of SCP-1532-a have an identical fingerprint pattern, which has been given to police forces across the continental U.S. under the pretense of a missing person. All instances of SCP-1532-a are completely sterile and unable to sexually reproduce. DNA tests of instances of SCP-1532-a shows that they all contain an identical specific non-coding sequence on Chromosome 19 that is not found anywhere else in nature.

Excerpt from an interview conducted by Dr. E█████ with an instance of SCP-1532-a purchased by a Foundation front company. The purchase included the “Supreme Sycophant” personality matrix.
> **Dr. E:** Hello.
> **SCP-1532-a:** Hello, sir.
> **Dr. E:** Please state your name, for the record.
> **SCP-1532-a:** Well, I was purchased as “Test Subject 1”, but you can call me anything you want, sir.
> **Dr. E:** So, you are aware that you were purchased from Dr. Gale’s Human Emporium?
> **SCP-1532-a:** Of course I am, sir.
> **Dr. E:** What exactly are you?
> **SCP-1532-a:** I’m sorry sir, but I’m afraid I don’t really understand the question. I’m sure it’s my fault.
> **Dr. E:** Well, how were you created?
> **SCP-1532-a:** I’m really, really sorry, sir, but I don’t remember.
> **Dr. E:** Do you know where Dr. Gale’s Human Emporium is located?
> **SCP-1532-a:** Dr. Gale’s Human Emporium is located at 143 Short Street, Lempster, Wyoming. P.O. box 7236C.
> **Dr. E:** Can you point out the location of Lempster, Wyoming on a map?
> **SCP-1532-a:** Of course, sir.
> [Dr. E shows SCP-1532-a a map of the state of Wyoming. SCP-1532-a inspects the map for three minutes.]
> **SCP-1532-a:** I’m sorry, sir, but this map is all wrong. Would you like me to go find you a better one?
> **Dr. E:** No. Let’s move on.
> **SCP-1532-a:** Whatever you say, sir.
> **Dr. E:**  What’s the very first thing you can remember?
> **SCP-1532-a:** I was in a van, sir. They gave me a name and an address to go to. I think it was... about two hours ago.
> **Dr. E:** And this doesn’t bother you at all?
> **SCP-1532-a:** No sir. Should it bother me?

On 11/04/20██, over two thousand copies of a new version of SCP-1532-b appeared in mailboxes across the North American continent. This version included several new traits not found in previous editions. The new edition also included a telephone number for “customer support”. The customer support number is fifteen digits long, significantly longer than any normal telephone number for the North American continent. Attempts to trace the phone number have failed. The following is a log of a phone conversation between Dr. C████ and one or more unknown entities. Dr. C████ was instructed to prolong the conversation for as long as possible to maximize potential information gained. Due to the context of the conversation and the distinct change between the voices from the other end of the line, it is most likely that at least three separate individuals spoke to Dr. C████, hereafter referred to as Entity-1, -2, and -3.
> **Entity-1:** Good Morning, thank you for calling Dr. Gale’s Human Emporium, my name is Ted. How can I help you?
> **Dr. C:** Hello, Ted. May I ask where your facility is located?
> **Entity-1:** Dr. Gale’s Human Emporium is located at one-four-three Short Street in Lempster, Wyoming.
> **Dr. C:** And where is Lempster, Wyoming located?
> **Entity-1:** It’s on the map, sir. Just west of New Dunsmouth, and south of Pale Sun.[[footnote]]Both names did not correspond with any city or town found anywhere in the United States.[[/footnote]]
> **Dr. C:** Do you have longitude and latitude coordinates?
> **Entity-1:** I’m afraid I don’t have that information. Do you have a specific complaint about one of our products? Because I have other customers on the line.
> **Dr. C:** Yes, actually. I recently bought a human from your company, but he died after less than a week.
> **Entity-1:** Can I have the product’s name and the delivery address?
> **Dr. C:** He was purchased as “Test Subject One” by my company [REDACTED].[[footnote]]Test Subject One had been purchased by a Foundation front company (see interview 1) and had been terminated prior to this call.[[/footnote]]
> **Entity-1:** Okay, here we go. According to our records, the product was alive and healthy when it was delivered to you.
> **Dr. C:** Yes, I know that. But it just dropped dead yesterday.
> **Entity-1:** Are you sure the human had access to food and water?
> **Dr. C:** Yes.
> **Entity-1:** Did you physically harm or damage the human prior to its death?
> **Dr. C:** No.
> **Entity-1:** Do you still have the body?
> **Dr. C:** Yes.
> **Entity-1:** Well, the best I can do is allow you to send the body back to us for a discount on your next purchase.
> **Dr. C:** That’s unacceptable. I want a replacement.
> **Entity-1:** I’m not authorized to issue a replacement, sir. Would you like to talk to the manager?
> **Dr. C:** Yes, please.
> **Entity-1:** Please hold.
> [audio on the other side becomes famous classical pieces being played by a jazz band for approximately ten minutes]
> **Entity-2:** Hello, thanks for calling Dr. Gale’s Human Emporium, my name is Clair. I’m told you have a complaint about a recently purchased human?
> **Dr. C:** Yes, he died yesterday and I’d like a replacement.
> **Entity-2:** Are you sure the human had access to food and water?
> **Dr. C:** Yes.
> **Entity-2:** Did you physically harm or damage the human prior to its death?
> **Dr. C:** No.
> **Entity-2:** Well, I suppose that we could offer a replacement, if you could bring the human back to our factory.
> **Dr. C:** Where is your factory located?
> **Entity-2:** A-hundred-and-forty-three Short Street, Lempster Wyoming.
> **Dr. C:** I have a map of Wyoming in front of me right now, and I don’t see anywhere called “Lempster”.
> **Entity-2:** Well, I guess you need a new map. [laugh] Just follow interstate twelve south from Pale Sun and you’ll run right into it.
> **Dr. C:** Interstate twelve doesn’t run through Wyoming.
> **Entity-2:** Are you sure you're looking at a current map?
> **Dr. C:** I’m sure.
> **Entity-2:** Well, I’m sorry. But unless you can return the human to our factory, we can’t offer a replacement.
> **Dr. C:** That’s unacceptable. I demand to speak to your superior.
> **Entity-2:** All right, if you insist. I’ll transfer you, but it might be a while before Dr. Gale answers the phone.
> [audio on the other side becomes famous classical pieces being played by a jazz band again for approximately one hour, twenty minutes]
> **Entity-3:** What speaks to I?[[footnote]]Linguistic analysis of Entity-3's syntax shows that Entity-3 is significantly less fluent in English than Entities-1 and -2. Voice analysis cannot determine where Entity-3's accent originates from, nor can it conclusively determine Entity-3's gender.[[/footnote]]
> **Dr. C:** Am I speaking to Dr. Gale?
> **Entity-3:** That is who I am named.
> **Dr. C:** Are you a human being?
> **Entity-3:** I create humans.
> **Dr. C:** But are you, yourself, a human?
> **Entity-3:** Put up the phone, Dr. C████. You have nothing to complain about.
> **Dr. C:** How did you know my name?
> **Entity-3:** Put up the phone. You have nothing to complain.
> **Dr. C:** Tell me how you know my name.
> **Entity-3:** Does anyone like being eaten?
> **Dr. C:** What?
> **Entity-3:** Put up the phone.
> **Dr. C:** What was that about being eaten?
> **Entity-3:** Put up the phone. Go back to your foundation.[[footnote]]It is currently unknown if Entity-3 is aware of the existence of the SCP Foundation, or if it was using the word "foundation" to mean something else.[[/footnote]] You have nothing to complain.
> **Dr. C:** What do you know about the Foundation?
> **Entity-3:** I have another work that needs doing. Goodbye.
> **Dr. C:** Wait-

//- These things are biologically indistinguishable from humans and aren’t that expensive. If we could purchase them in bulk we could eliminate the need for D-class all together. – Dr. E█████//

//- Negative. Until we find the location of SCP-1532 and discover how these things are being made, we must consider them as potentially hostile entities and deal with them appropriately. – O5-██//

//- Why are we spending so many Foundation resources to attempt to locate SCP-1532, when we don’t even know that it exists in any way we can comprehend? Everything we know about it comes from instances of SCP-1532-a and -b. What if it only exists in whatever realm of reality the delivery vans come from and go to? – O5-█//

//- The potential gains for the Foundation warrant further investigation. Furthermore, the entity identified as “Dr. Gale” knew Dr. C████‘s name and appeared to know about the existence of the SCP Foundation, representing a serious security breach we must pursue. – O5-██//
