**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4966 is to be kept within a modified humanoid containment cell sized appropriately for a big fuckin' sandwich to move freely. This cell is to be furnished with several pieces of furniture, most importantly a sizable toppings bar for the big fuckin' sandwich. Toppings such as lettuce, tomatoes, and various condiments have also been provided. SCP-4966 is to be socialized with tri-weekly by on-site researchers. Tests involving SCP-4966 are to be approved by Dr. Bannock. Personnel wishing to provide SCP-4966 with additional toppings for the big fuckin' sandwich are to purchase them using their own funds.

**Description:** SCP-4966 is an African American male holding a big fuckin' sandwich. All attempts to pierce or damage this sandwich have failed. X-rays and other examinations of the big fuckin' sandwich have shown the presence of standard sandwich ingredients, although really fuckin' big. SCP-4966’s sandwich is completely devoid of markings or orifices, most likely due to it being a sandwich, and not a person. Vocalizations made by SCP-4966 are similar to that of an American male, very exited to consume a big fuckin' sandwich. SCP-4966 is highly social and will become anxious and withdrawn if not socialized with on a normal basis. SCP-4966 has a tendency to imitate the actions of other entities it interacts with, most notably if those individuals are eating similarly sized sandwiches. SCP-4966 shows no apparent need to eat, drink, or breathe, although it will imitate these actions if another entity is doing the same. 

When presented with the corpse of an organism, SCP-4966 will turn the corpse into a big fuckin' sandwich. These sandwiches are universally recognized as "fuckin'" and "big". No limit has been found to the amount of dead tissue SCP-4966 is able to convert into a big fuckin' sandwich, with it having completely converted the corpse of an adult //Balaenoptera musculus//[[footnote]]Blue whale[[/footnote]] during testing.. Consumption of these sandwiches have produced no anomalous effects, despite their nature as being fuckin' big. 

**Addendum:** Included below are several excerpts from the SCP-4966 experiment log for the purpose of further understanding SCP-4966’s big fuckin' sandwiches.

> **Introduced Corpse:** The corpse of D-01763, who was an upholsterer prior to her incarceration.
> 
> **Corpse Integrity:** Well preserved.
> 
> **Developed Alterations:** No physical alterations were observed. Upon consumption, SCP-4966 emitted several strained vocalizations before speaking in slightly incoherent English. SCP-4966 began commenting on the construction of its furniture, claiming that its provided bedding material was far below standard requirements for domestic pets. 
> 
> **Sandwich Result:** Turned into a big fuckin' sandwich.

Following this discovery, a raid on Site-17 was conducted by operatives of GoI-003 (“Chaos Insurgency”) where operatives attempted to gain access to SCP-4966’s chamber among other anomalous objects. Once the raid was repelled, a damaged Insurgency document was discovered among the corpses that gave detailed information regarding several anomalous objects, including SCP-4966. SCP-4966 was provided with the corpses of several GoI-003 members in the hopes of discovering how this information was acquired. A transcript of the interview conducted with SCP-4966 has been provided below.

> **Interviewed:** SCP-4966
> 
> **Interviewer:** Dr. Randall Bannock 
> 
> **Additional Information:** Due to a lack of relevant information, 2 hours and 14 minutes of the interview have been excluded. For a full transcript of the interview, see Document-4966-IV.

> **Dr. Bannock:** SCP-4966, can we please get back to the subject at hand.
> 
> **SCP-4966:** I want a big fuckin' sandwich. 
> 
> **Dr. Bannock:** You’ve already been given seven big fuckin' sandwiches. You’ll get some after we’ve finished the interview.
> 
> **SCP-4966:** No, I want a big fuckin' sandwich now. 
> 
> **Dr. Bannock:** (//Holding his head in his hands//) SCP-4966, this would go much smoother if you simply cooperated. 
> 
> **SCP-4966:** I want a better toppings bar. The one you guys have is lacking key condiments. How hard is it to get some fuckin' barbecue sauce for my big fuckin' sandwich? 
> 
> **Dr. Bannock:** SCP-4966, if you answer the question, I’ll give you another big fuckin' sandwich.
> 
> **SCP-4966:** (//Pauses//) If I get the good big fuckin' sandwich this time. 
> 
> **Dr. Bannock:** How did the Insurgency know where you were?
> 
> **SCP-4966:** The Insurgency? They found the room with my number on it.
> 
> **Dr. Bannock:** (//Sigh//) How did they know that was your item number?
> 
> **SCP-4966:** I was in the room, so the room had my number on it. Do you not know how the anomaly naming system works? Also I want my new topping bar faster, or I'll commit a crime of some kind. Don't know which one yet, but I'll do it. 
> 
> **Dr. Bannock:** Your new topping bar is coming soon. Ho-
> 
> **SCP-4966:** How soon?
> 
> **Dr. Bannock:** Tomorrow. How did they know where the building was?
> 
> **SCP-4966:** Big fuckin' sandwich.
> 
> (//SCP-4966 is given a big fuckin' sandwich. The big fuckin' sandwich is consumed by SCP-4966. No matter is regurgitated, because that would be weird.//)
> 
> **SCP-4966:** (//Leans in//) Alright, here's the deal.
> 
> **SCP-4966:** I've got no fuckin' clue.

After some difficulties, SCP-4966 admitted that they knew nothing about the raid. Dr. Bannock has requested a temporary leave of absence, although this has been tentatively denied due to his in-depth knowledge of big fuckin' sandwiches.
