**Item #:** SCP-1621

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** One colony of SCP-1621 is to be kept intact within the specified containment chamber of Bio-Containment Area-09. BCA-09 is an isolated facility specifically designed for the purpose of containing SCP-1621, as well as collecting and storing its chemical byproduct for use by the Foundation as a component in rocket fuels, in industrial cleaning and etching operations for semiconductors, in nuclear reactor fuel processing, and other industrial operations. The containment facility, byproduct collection apparatus and storage containers must be constructed entirely from stainless steel, copper, any of the "monel" nickel alloys, or else regularly treated with a coating of PTFE (Teflon), PCTFE (Kel-F) or another similar dry, highly flourinated polymer to prevent the risk of a CL2F6 reaction and subsequent breach of containment. Any site-necessary equipment that cannot be provided under these conditions is to be either treated with an appropriate polymer coating. If a polymer coating would neutralize the purpose of the equipment, it is to be located within one of the specially designed 'safe rooms.' 

Safe rooms are to be located against the exterior walls of BCA-09 and equipped with both manual and automatic thermal and atmospheric seals, an external air lock and air to last at least one hour. Personnel responsible for manning BCA-09 are required to perform all direct interactions with SCP-1621 in full-body, encapsulated hazardous material suits complete with self-contained breathing units. These must have been thoroughly treated with an appropriate polymer, to be reapplied regularly without exceptions.

The containment chamber is to be accessible only via air lock, and is to provide 10m x 10m x 5m bed of soil native to the colony's point of origin. The soil is to be irrigated from the base of the soil bed- at no point is water to be released above soil level. Water release above soil level will cause a CL2F6 reaction and will breach containment. A ventilation system to deliver carbon dioxide is to be installed, as well as a gas collection apparatus to collect and deliver the chemical byproduct to specialized polymer filters to isolate CL2F6 and then divert it to storage containers. Light is to be provided from behind polymer-sealed diffuser sheets to prevent CL2F6 vapors from destroying the light or breaching containment. A Foundation-crewed transport is to replenish soil stores and CO2 canisters, as well as provide transportation to the surface during staff rotation once every two months. In the event of a containment breach, all personnel is to immediately report to their assigned safe room. Upon detection of CL2F6 vapors beyond .01PPM within the safe room, or once all reported personnel are within the safe room, the safe room will seal. When all safe rooms have been hermetically sealed, BCA-09 will flood the facility and containment chamber with liquid nitrogen. Foundation agents will retrieve surviving personnel and investigate the cause of the containment breach, while a clean-up of the facility is executed. Once the neutralized colony has been removed, the facility will be prepped to await discovery and delivery of another colony of SCP-1621. This downtime is to be used to train replacement personnel for those killed by the containment breach or subsequent facility purge.

All colonies of SCP-1621 not earmarked for transfer to BCA-09 are to be isolated and destroyed. Permanent flooding of the area of infestation is a viable option, as SCP-1621 cannot survive underwater and the byproduct is effectively- though violently- neutralized by complete immersion in water. If this option is unavailable, an area extending 10m beyond the contaminated surface area to a depth of 5m must be tilled under and treated with liquid nitrogen to purge the vines, stalks and roots.

**Description:** SCP-1621 is an invasive, flowering vine colony that bears some slight genotypical similarity to various members of the order //Malphigiales//, most notably //Rhizophora, Tetracoccus, Rafflesia, Viola// and //Passiflora//. Consistent features across the several variations include: central stalks, widespread root structures, and flowers of varying size amongst of a network of expansive vines. Phenotypical variations include presence/absence of fruit; flavoring of fruit if present; coloring of vines, leaves, stalks, flowers as well as fruit if present. While no specimen of SCP-1621 has ever exhibited intelligence or sapience of any sort, all specimens found in the wild mimicked one or more indigenous species of flora to a high degree of accuracy and originally lead to the sub-classification of SCP-1621. Note, however, that only one genotype of SCP-1621 has been identified- all variants are, in fact, merely adaptive camoflage and do not indicate divergent evolution nor development of a subspecies of SCP-1621. Fruit-bearing specimens do not contain CL2F6 and, in fact, if they can be harvested safely, have proven safe to eat and a close approximation of the fruit mimicked. 

SCP-1621 has proven strangely resilient to indirect force, radioactivity and heat, theoretically as a defense against its own CL2F6 reactions. The most effective means of disposal is flooding the contaminated area with liquid nitrogen.

The flowers, roots and vines of SCP-1621 secrete a chemical in place of sap or nectar which, following the initial containment of a colony in C████████, R████ was identified to be the compound CL2F6, chlorotriflouride. CL2F6 vaporizes in the open at temperatures higher than 13 degrees celsius, is colorless and smells sweet. This is its primary method of attracting nutrients. While a stalk can sustain itself indefinitely given soil, water, sunlight and carbon dioxide, it must be able to fertilize the ground surrounding itself to expand the colony. As insects and animals are attracted to the scent of the chemical, they inhale greater and greater amounts of CL2F6. At 800 PPM, this results in death within fifteen minutes (compare to carbon monoxide, which requires 6400 PPM to reach the same level of lethality). Considering the rapid increase in concentration as a victim approaches the stalk, and the speed of incapacitation even after realizing their danger, the vapors prove to be highly dangerous.

In liquid form- in which the plant stores the chemical internally and secretes it- CL2F6 is corrosive, toxic, hypergolic on contact with most combustible materials without a spark or ignition source, reacts violently when in contact with water, ice, or silicon- containing compounds (including sand, asbestos and glass), is incompatible with oil, grease, reducing agents, organic compounds, fuels and combustibles and most metals and metal oxides, cannot catch fire and so cannot be neutralized by ignition and decomposes into chlorine, flourine and hydrogen flourine gasses- all of which are highly dangerous in their own rights, much less together- if exposed to temperatures higher than 220 degrees celsius. It does not react with dry, highly fluorinated polymers such as PTFE (Teflon) or PCTFE (Kel-F), the metals used in storage containers (monel, copper, and stainless steel) or gaskets (teflon), nitrogen or air, and the inert gases (neon, etc.). 

The stalks of SCP-1621 possess expansive root structures, approximately twice as broad as the root structures of the native species SCP-1621 is mimicking. If the roots are provided with nutrients- typically in the form of animals that fall prey to CL2F6's toxic qualities- it will also extrude vines in all directions at a visibly observable pace that continues until the the nutrients provided by the rapid dissolution of the victim's body by the continuous action of CL2F6 is expended. Provided with enough biological material, they can expand at a rate of ██m/h. If they encounter stationary objects, they can climb the object at a much slower pace, but typically one or more instances of a CL2F6 reaction have reducted the object to rubble or ash. When a vine extends to a length from the stalk equivalent to twice the median radius of the root structure, it penetrates the soil and begins to sprout, creating a new stalk and spreading the colony. It is a highly competitive plant and in all but the most arid climates wipes out all other plant life around the colony by way of corrosion, and CL2F6 reactions triggered by rainfall.

It is unknown if SCP-1621 existed prior to the aforementioned incident at C████████, but clearly the proliferation of gasoline, gas mains, water mains and other sources of explosive potential, combined with the rapid expanse of the SCP-1621 colony when supplied with sufficient nutrients, such as those provided by the dead and dying after a CL2F6 reaction in a populated area, leave even a single uncontained SCP-1621 colony a dangerous threat- not to mention the obvious danger of infestation of a nuclear power plant.

As CL2F6, despite attempts to synthesize it, can only be acquired directly from a specimen of SCP-1621, and it is available for purchase from K███████████ Co., there is at least one colony of SCP-1621 being maintained by an organization supplying K███████████ Co. A team headed by Agent W█████ is researching the identity of this organization.
