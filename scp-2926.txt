**Item #:** SCP-2926

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2926 is kept at Electronic Storage Facility 83-Beta. No known copies of SCP-2926 exist outside of containment.

**Description:** SCP-2926 is a computer program that, when provided with a digital image, will provide a short verbal description of its contents, along with one of seven "judgments" at random. The descriptions are always somewhat inaccurate.

> **Sample Input:** [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-2926/sphinx.jpg elephant.jpg]
> **Sample Output:** An elephant with the proper number of wings. Judgment: A squeeze play that works two ways.

SCP-2926's outputs have cognitohazardous properties depending on which judgment is selected, provided that the viewer has also seen the input image.

||~ Judgment ||~ Effects ||
|| I feel so empty. || Viewer will become capable of identifying the patterns in SCP-2926's "inaccuracies", as well as in the program's delivery of judgments. ||
|| I'm not the tooth fairy. || Viewer will become capable of identifying the inaccuracies present in SCP-2926's input images. ||
|| It grew to the size of an orange. || Viewer will become capable of identifying consensuses regarding the subjects of SCP-2926's input images and modifying them for accuracy. ||
|| These are strange times. || Viewer will be compelled to arrange for a judgment of "A squeeze play that works two ways." by any means necessary. ||
|| God, wouldn't it be beautiful? || Viewer will coordinate all aforementioned viewers in order to create a consensus reality in which SCP-2926 can take the form of the sphinx. ||
|| I think I broke it. || Viewer will identify and attend to the sphinx momentarily, after its receptacle is prepared. ||
|| A squeeze play that works two ways. || The sphinx is realized in the viewer. You possessed no inaccuracies. The situation is immanent. ||
