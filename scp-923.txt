    **Item #:** SCP-923

    **Object Class:** Safe

    **Special Containment Procedures:** None.  SCP-923 is currently in orbit at an altitude of ███ km.  This, combined with its automated defenses, makes retrieval impossible.  SCP-923 reports that it has no control over its defense mechanisms.

Since the object ignores all queries and instructions that lack O5-level authorization, termination of the object has been suspended until it becomes unusable.

    **Description:**  SCP-923 is a satellite that includes a large, parabolic dish constructed of unknown alloys.  The object is also equipped with a ███████ reactor, which satisfies the power needs of its "firing mechanism."  It is unclear how SCP-923 generates the effects of firing on a target, but tests have shown that subjects placed between SCP-923 and its target are unaffected.

Much of the information about SCP-923 has been gathered from SCP-923 itself.  The object reports that it was constructed by the Foundation at Site ██, which was planned to be constructed in ████████, ██, but cancelled due to logistical concerns.  SCP-923 is not to be informed of this under any circumstances.  The object is semi-sentient and capable of basic deductions, but appears to use this ability solely for information queries.

SCP-923 first came to the Foundation's knowledge on ██/██/██ when it started reporting back "successful termination" messages from various points around the globe on the O5 secured information relay system.  These reports continued over the course of █ hours, totalling 57 terminations around the globe at intensities between ██ and ███.  55 of these deaths have been confirmed since the original incident.  To access the list of terminated individuals, see Document 923-0014-K.  The Foundation has been unable to determine how SCP-923 gained access to the O5 secured information relay system.  Adjustments have been made to prevent SCP-923 from gathering any information on that system unless it is meant specifically for SCP-923.

SCP-923 is capable of rapidly shifting its orbit in order to reach a target quickly.  When given O5-level authorization, the object will accept firing orders.  It requires standard GPS coordinates, altitude, a time, and an integer value for the intensity.  An experiment log for determining what the numbers mean has been included.  Special permission has been granted to keep some D-Class personnel alive beyond the normal expiration date for the purpose of study.

**Intensity:  10**
Response:  Error reported by SCP-923 stating that it was incapable of firing at an intensity lower than 23.

**Intensity:  25**
Response:  Subjects reported hearing voices, interacting with people not present, overwhelming paranoia, compulsions to harm others, and terror.
Time until recovery:  15-19 days.

**Intensity:  35**
Response:  Similar to intensity 25, but with the subjects also reported compulsions to harm themselves, constant suicidal thoughts.  Researchers within 10 meters of the target reported having panic attacks.
Time until recovery:  6-8 months.

//Note from Dr. ████:
It looks like this thing actually has a blast effect to it and not just a laser of madness.  From now on, researchers are to observe remotely and D-Class personnel are to be secured so they can't harm themselves.  We need them alive for study.//

**Intensity:  50**
Response:  Identical to the above test.
Time until recovery:  Subjects have not recovered.

**Intensity:  75**
Response:  Target went completely catatonic.  A number of D-Class personnel within 15 meters of the target were able to break free of their restraints and proceeded to kill all D-Class personnel they could see by [DATA EXPUNGED] with their teeth before eventually turned on each other.  Subjects up to 50 meters away reported panic attacks lasting up to one hour.  

//Note from Dr. ████:
This is crossing the line from scientific to just barbaric.  SCP-923 has said that its maximum output is 238, which it promptly converts to "keter" intensity.  Lets just see what this does and report our findings.//

**Intensity:  Keter**
Response:  It is strongly advised that this intensity never be used again because, in addition to causing permanent insanity in all subjects in a 2 kilometer radius around the target, surveillance equipment at the epicenter observed the materialization of [DATA EXPUNGED], which dissipated after ██ minutes.  The site, located at ██°██'██", -██°██'██", is now designated as SCP-923-02, due to the permanent effects to the landscape at and surrounding the epicenter, and is to be quarantined with standard containment prodecures.  Subjects attempting to reach the epicenter experience greater and greater feelings of panic, beginning at a distance of ███ meters, eventually resulting in insanity similar to the lower intensity tests.  Post-incident investigation of the site has revealed spatial and temporal disturbances consistent with [DATA EXPUNGED].  Due to [DATA EXPUNGED] and the damage done to ground-zero, SCP-923 is currently undergoing O5 review for its potential to cause an XK-Class event.

    **Addendum:**
Firing SCP-923 causes some internal damage, resulting in the minimum intensity it can fire at increasing.  SCP-923's internal diagnostics report that it can no longer fire at an intensity below 66.  It is highly recommended that the object not be used for anything that it isn't absolutely required for.
