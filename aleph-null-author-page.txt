Ah, the infamous first SCP. Some can claim to make on their first shot. I am not one of those people, This bombed twice before Jim came along helped make it presentable. There’s no real origin for this besides me thinking a joke self conscious about how funny it is would be interesting.

My first tale was for the Original Character Tournament featuring SCP-3369, SCP-3416, and SCP-3947. Enough people thought it was good and so it remains.

In the how to write an SCP guide it says to use an unconventional fear. So I used what is probably my weirdest fear: the Nazca lines. I can’t describe what makes them so creepy to me, just that they give me a feeling of dread. I also noticed a lack of geoglyphs on the wiki and I sought to fix that.
