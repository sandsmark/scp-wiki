++++ **__Description__**

SCP-5108 is a collective designation for the CIA's Operation MKDalton[[footnote]] MKDalton is a top-secret para-science project experimenting with remote viewing.[[/footnote]] and all anomalies, events, and technology derived therefrom.

SCP-5108-1 is the corpse of a Class/2 Clairvoyant humanoid which was capable of remote viewing[[footnote]]Clairvoyant ability to view distant or unseen targets using psionic projection.  [[/footnote]]. SCP-5108-1 had received extensive biological and technological modifications to amplify its natural abilities and allow for integration with SCP-5108-2.

[[include :scp-sandbox-3:image-blur name=http://topia.wikidot.com/local--files/drakimotosdonkument/girl|caption=SCP-5108-1 prior to autopsy.|width=300px|align=right]]
**Date:** 1967/12/02

**Subject:** SCP-5108-1

**Operator:** Dr. William Strauss 
------
Sex: Female
Body Weight: 66.2 kg
Height: 161.5 cm
BMI: 19.7s
Brain Weight: 1625 g
------
**External Examination**

The subject is approximately 15-18 years old; an x-ray of SCP-5108-1's left wrist and hand confirmed estimation. Subject's wrists and ankles have severe ligature marks and the appendages are in a state of atrophy, clear signs of long term captivity. The externally visible modifications include:

* Eyes have been surgically removed.[[footnote]]Older subjects show significant scarring  around the supraorbital indicating self-inflicted damage.[[/footnote]]
* Occipital bone has been removed and replaced with a steel-plated fiberoptic port. 
* The jaw bone has been wired shut. [[footnote]]Extensive scarification and damage found in older subjects indicate substantial self-inflicted damage done to the entire vocal structure.[[/footnote]]
* Tongue shows signs of damage, assumed to be self-inflicted.
* Extensive surgical scarring along subject's sternum and spine.

**Internal Examination:**

Scans indicate a total of 32 foreign objects within SCP-5108-1's body. These internal adjustments include: 

* Neural interface connected to the occipital lobe.
* Vocal cords have been replaced with a device of unknown function. [[footnote]]This device is absent in older subjects, which suggests this device serves as a subvocal communication device in order to prevent damage from excessive vocalizations.[[/footnote]]
* Titanium couplings replacing the Axis C2 cervical, T1 and T3 thoracic, L3  and L4 lumbar vertebrae.
* 6 fiberoptic cables integrated into the spinal cord.
* Intra-arterial port imbedded in the jugular artery.
* 4 unknown electronic devices implanted in the chest cavity, wires connecting the heart to the spinal column.
* Both Achilles' tendons have been surgically removed.

**Toxicity**

SCP-5108-1's toxicology screening shows signs of long term exposure to LSD, mescaline, opiates and 2 previously undiscovered chemical compounds. 

**Cause of Death**

SCP-5108-1 died from cardiac arrest due to a high voltage current. Scarring in and around the subject's right ear indicate that being the point of entry.

SCP-5108-2 is the collective designation for the equipment used to amplify SCP-5108-1's clairvoyant abilities.  Radio transmitters, an audio/video interface, an infusion pump, and a data storage unit are among the various components of SCP-5108-2, all of which were powered by a series of Tesla coils.  It was capable of connecting to SCP-5108-1 through a fiberoptic port at the base of SCP-5108-1's skull as well as an Intra-arterial port in the jugular. Detailed schematics were taken of SCP-5108-2 prior to its disassembly.

SCP-5108-Ω was a psionic cognitohazard caused by over-amplification of SCP-5108's clairvoyant abilities through the use of SCP-5108-2. Targets viewed by SCP-5108-1 under these conditions would begin to experience the following symptoms:
* Auditory and visual hallucinations
* Pareidolia
* False memories 
* Temporary blindness
* Loss of speech
* Anxiety 
Of these symptoms, pareidolia and false memories are the most common. These symptoms are psionic manifestations of events and afflictions experienced by SCP-5108 during its time in Operation MKDalton.

++++ **__Discovery__**
On 1966/02/23, Foundation assets within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Illinois State Police reported an outbreak of mass hallucinations and other abnormal medical phenomena in and around Nixon, Illinois. The number of affected individuals was estimated to be approximately 5000 civilians. 

The event was considered an immediate threat to normalcy and O5 Command authorized use of the recently developed  CH/6077, an auditory cognitohazard capable of exerting selective retrograde amnesia of specific events. After the successful results of CH/6077, Cover Story-Z6X78 (Unknown Flu Epidemic) was enacted. 

A Foundation listening post in Chicago deciphered the SCP-5108-Ω cognitohazard within a radio broadcast originating from Pattonsville, Illinois. Investigation Task Force Charlie-6 ("Brakon's Hope") examined local electric records for irregularly high power usage; this traced the broadcast to a warehouse 2 miles south of Pattonsville. 

Upon arrival, the warehouse was abandoned but had shown signs of recent occupation. ITF Charlie-6 utilized tax records to trace the ownership of the warehouse to the Calnon company, a subsidiary of Valchem Technologies. Valchem Technologies was later discovered to be a black-ops front organization directed by the CIA and the Institute of Defense Analysis (IDA). 

Following the Little Hill Event and before the Morningstar Treaty was enacted, the Foundation seized several CIA black sites, including Warehouse K70. SCP-5108 was among the anomalies and para-technologies found within Warehouse K70 during its acquisition on 1967/11/30.

**Date:**  1968/01/05 @ 11:02
**Briefing Attorney:** Michelle M. Franks, Esq., L4 Senior Counsel, Foundation Inter-Governmental Affairs
**Attendees:** O5-█, on behalf of Overwatch Command; Dr. John Freemont, L5 Department Chair, Foundation Inter-Governmental Affairs
**Foreword:** //In order to expedite the process, Foundation Senior Counsel has been directed to provide an overview briefing to the interested parties.//
-----

[BEGIN LOG]

**Franks:** Thank you for coming today, gentlemen. In the interest of brevity, I will begin.

**O5-█:** You can skip the preamble and the general boilerplate, Michelle. John and I have both read it and we trust your assessment on the legitimacy of the language used. I don't want to waste any of our time going over the endless distinctions of "shall" and "will".

**Franks:** Of course, sir. The Forward and Preamble are pretty much that. It does lay out the concept //in toto// that the CIA wishes to utilize anomalous artifacts, entities, etc. to conduct operations where such things would be most advantageous and agrees to Foundation oversight when such anomalies within our purview are to be used. 

**Dr. Freemont:** Wait, does it also include that we're the final arbiters of what is and isn't considered anomalous?

**Franks:** Yes, explicitly. In Article I, subsection C, the language defines an anomaly as per the Foundation Charter. Additionally, Article I, subsection FF outlines that the Foundation may choose, at its discretion, to classify essentially anything it so desires as "anomalous".

**Dr. Freemont:** And the CIA agreed to that?

**O5-█:** We didn't give them much of a choice in that, John. Our standing agreement with the US Government explicitly outlines that such things are within our purview. If we are to be able to do our jobs effectively, we also have to enjoy complete freedom to decide what is and what is not "anomalous".

**Franks:** Exactly. This document, in numerous places, states that it neither supersedes nor replaces any of the previous standing agreements with the US Government, or the Foundation Charter itself.

**Dr. Freemont:** That's fair.

**O5-█:** No, it most certainly is not. Our purpose is to protect the people of the world, not pander to the interests of any nation-state, no matter how large. Go on, Ms. Franks.

**Franks:** In Article III, we have what is essentially an agreement to discuss outside influences and their //ex post facto// impact upon this arrangement. 

**Dr. Freemont:**  So, people talking about it afterwards? Are we talking about what happens if one of the CIA's operations gets leaked to the media?

**Franks:** Precisely. If this gets out, how both of us will be forced to react to its knowledge being out in the public sphere. 

**O5-█:** We'd handle that just as we'd handle any other veil breach event, I'm assuming.

**Franks:** More or less. This agreement assumes that the CIA's internal security measures are in no way comparable to our own. Despite the tremendous amount of freedom that the CIA enjoys within the apparatus of the US Government, they still have to answer (at least in part) to representatives of the American people. 

In the event of an information breach, the CIA will disavow all knowledge or complicity in the affair, and we will be free to react accordingly. This will also be considered grounds for termination of this agreement.

**O5-█:** Kinda like what brought us to this mess in the first place? Or the Little Hill event for that matter.

**Franks:** Yes. That brings up another point. The MKDalton project failed in a dramatic way precisely because the CIA didn't know what it was doing. They were way out of their depth, and the degree to which they agreed to this treaty is an example of how desperate they were for our help. In return, they've agreed to pay for all costs associated with any cleanup effort another "mistake" might cause. 

**O5-█:** Is this in addition to the funding already appropriated by the US Government for Foundation operations?

**Franks:** Yes. If you look inside the file that I've provided, you'll find the funding details itemized on page two.

<//The sounds of rustling paper can be heard for a few moments.//>

**Dr. Freemont:** <//grunts//> Are you sure this isn't coming out of the funds already promised? I didn't realize that the CIA had that kind of ready funding.  

**O5-█:** <//chuckling//> You've spent too much time working with the Soviets, John. The US has money to burn, especially with the Apollo missions essentially - 

**[Several minutes of conversation have been redacted. A full copy of this transcript is available to those with 05+ clearance only.]**

**Franks:** The funding issue and my pending amnestic treatments aside, the MKDalton event also has provided the impetus to give us greater oversight and access to the CIA information network. If you turn to Section VII, Anomalous Espionage, you'll see that the operational control over MKDalton and similar projects will be entirely under our jurisdiction. 

**O5-█:** So, not only do we get to decide what is to be considered anomalous, we also get to decide what information gets shared with the CIA? 

**Franks:** As well as how it gets shared. 

**Dr, Freemont:** <//low whistle//> I bet the J. Edgars loved that little treat. 

**Franks:** It was a point of contention for several weeks. They initially wanted several of their agents involved directly with the project, but that would have required either provisional clearance for their operatives, or the creation of an entirely new joint Site. Both of which would have been in violation of the Charter. 

**O5-█:** Do it our way, or don't do it at all. Excellent work, Michelle. Please send a copy of the complete agreement to my office at Site-01, and I'll have Jason make the appropriate copies and get all the signatures required. John, it's been a pleasure.

**Dr. Freemont:** Yes, sir. It always is. Thank you as well, Michelle. Your work has been exemplary.

**Asset Summary:** The following system is collectively designated SCP-5108-3. 

Site-51 Medical Department staff were successful in implanting 8 D-Class subjects with sections of SCP-5108-1's brain and spinal cord (designated SCP-5108-3/A), for use in Operation MKDalton. These entities have been surgically modified for optimal performance; instances lack arms, legs, and sensory orifices[[footnote]]Eyes, ears, mouth, and nose.[[/footnote]]. Subjects are suspended a lithium based conductive fluid. This acts as receiver for subdermal fiberoptic nodes across the subject's brain and along its spinal cord. 

The SCP-5108-3/A vats are held within an updated amplification array that was designed using the schematics of SCP-5108-2. This array uses its various psionic and biochemical components, as well as six satilites and a nuclear fusion reactor in order to amplify and project extrasensory perception. Unlike its previous iteration SCP-5108-3 is able to fully function without negative side-effects. Designed to be self sufficient, SCP-5108-3 requires limited human interaction. 

**Operational Capabilities:**  SCP-5108-3 continuously monitors a preregistered list of coordinates and records visual and audio perception into its external server. It is capable of monitoring 12 locations simultaneously and specific coordinates can be viewed via the command panel. Each viewing session is recorded as an .mp4 file and is then transcribed, archived, and forwarded to the appropriate departments. 

Operation MKDalton currently has a sustained success rate of 100%.

##red|**Notice:**## On 1994/01/30, Operation MKDalton was re-approved with a 25 year contract. Due to moral and ethical concerns this approval was rejected by the Ethics Committee on 1994/07/12.

**Chairperson:** Jonathon DeCroix, Director, Ethics Committee
**Attendees:** O5-█, on behalf of Overwatch Command; Samatha Hines, PsyD.; Ayo Oluwafeyisayo, DDiv; Maïté Chevotet, DDiv.; Niklas Söderholm, PhD, JD;
**Foreword:** //The subject of MKDalton and the ongoing SCP-5108 project was put to the Committee during a regularly scheduled session. The portions of the meeting not relevant to SCP-5108 have been omitted.//
-----

[BEGIN LOG]

**DeCroix:** Now on to agenda item D-28, SCP-5108 and the MKDalton Project. I assume everyone has read-

**O5-█:** This one has already been voted on by the Overwatch Command, and it has been designated as Essential.

**DeCroix:** Forgive me, sir, but are you saying that Command has already considered this, without advice from the Ethics Committee?

**O5-█:** That's //exactly// what I'm saying, Jonathon. This one is going to continue, whether you like it or not. 

**Oluwafeyisayo:** I certainly do not like it. These people are //alive//, and I don't give a fuck if they're D-Class. Yes, they've all been sentenced to death, but what you're doing to them is not death, it's worse. It's goddamn //criminal//.

**Söderholm:** Ms. Oluwafeyisayo, the Foundation has a pretty broad mandate to interpret what is and is-

**Oluwafeyisayo:** I don't give a damn about the Foundation's mandate in this, Söderholm, and you know that. I don't need you to remind me that the Foundation operates "beyond the law". MKDalton was illegal as hell when the CI-fucking-A started it, and we've only made it worse. How are we supposed to do our jobs if the O5's just plow on through without even consulting us?

**O5-█:** Let me assure you that Overwatch is very much aware that what is going on in MKDalton isn't even remotely ethical. This isn't the first time that an Ethics Committee board has discussed this project. It was overruled in the 70s, and it's been overruled now. The benefits of this project far outweigh the ethical concerns and-

**Oluwafeyisayo:** How can you even say that without-

**O5-█:** Sit. Down. Ms. Oluwafeyisayo. <//short pause//> I understand your concern, and believe me when I say that this has been given ample consideration. There is //nothing// you can say that hasn't already been brought up before. 

**DeCroix:** With all due respect, sir. It is still our purview to vote and issue advisement. Even when we know it isn't going to be followed.

**O5-█:** By all means, please carry on.

**DeCroix:** On the subject of SCP-5108 and the MKDalton project, do you vote Termination or Continuation?

**Hines:** Termination

**Oluwafeyisayo:** Termination, obviously.

**Chevotet:** Termination

**Söderholm:** Abstain.

**DeCroix:** By vote of 3-0 for termination, with one abstention, the Chair declines to vote. The Ethics Committee so advises Overwatch Command. 

**O5-█:** Recommendation overruled by Overwatch designation: Essential. If non-essential employees wish to be re-assigned, they are welcome to submit a request.

[END LOG]

In a unanimous decision, O5 Command overrode the Ethics Committee's objection and proceeded to reinstate the project, citing Operation MKDalton's success rate and the overwhelming value of information gathered therefrom.
