**Item #:** SCP-3858

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Until such a time where a permanent containment solution has been established, Foundation web crawlers have been set up to detect and remove links to SCP-3858 on publically-visible websites. SCP-3858-A instances created by civilians should be confiscated and incinerated, any .lmb files deleted from their computer and the civilian amnesticised.

**Description:** SCP-3858 is an anomalous filesharing network named "Hugbox", formerly available at the URL "@@http://beararms.right.to@@" prior to Foundation intervention. The front page of SCP-3858's website advertises "end-to-end organic encryption": this is believed to refer to the primary anomalous property of SCP-3858, where it converts all files submitted by the user into an anomalous format with extension ".lmb".

At the time of writing, only one application known to the Foundation is capable of viewing .lmb files: namely the web-based client for SCP-3858 itself. Attempting to open .lmb files with any other application results in the secondary anomalous effect of SCP-3858 manifesting: namely, the creation of multiple objects resembling human arms (designated SCP-3858-A) in the immediate vicinity of the user. The quantity of SCP-3858-A instances manifested is proportional to the .lmb file's size.

SCP-3858-A instances consist of a plastic "skeleton" articulated in a way similar to an actual human arm, covered with human epidermal tissue at a thickness of 5 centimeters. They experience a large force of attraction towards the user that opened the .lmb file proportional to the distance from the user: the only known ways of stopping this force of attraction is by deleting the .lmb file from the computer that opened it, killing the user or physically destroying the SCP-3858-A instances.

**Recovery:** SCP-3858 was initially identified by the Foundation following a routine investigation of suspected web-based anomalies by MTF Mu-5 ("Debuggers"). When attempts to trace the location of SCP-3858's hosting proved inconclusive, Mu-5 specialists managed to secure temporary access to the root account of the host and recovered several files from other users' accounts before being locked out; further attempts to compromise the website made by the Foundation have failed.

One of the files recovered belonged to the user "[[[gamers-against-weed-dossier|gcmp4]]]" and notably did not possess the ".lmb" extension, instead being a file named "UNIVERSAL DONOR [WIP].org". Analysis and comparison of the file in question (SCP-3858-B) shows some similarity to ".lmb" files, although SCP-3858's web client is unable to preview it, rendering its contents impossible to view and thus analyse at present.

When SCP-3858-B is opened with an improper application, instead of SCP-3858-A instances manifesting, a cube of O-negative blood approximately 3.9 liters in volume and at -85Â°C in temperature will appear nearby the user. Notably, the date of upload of the file approximately coincides with several hundred donations of O-negative blood made across the Southwestern United States: the names of the donor in each case appears to have been corrupted by [[[SCP-2586]]].
