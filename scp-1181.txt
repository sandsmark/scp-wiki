**Item #:** SCP-1181

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** Site-916 is situated 100 meters from the northern edge of SCP-1181. Patrol teams monitor the perimeter of SCP-1181 and any civilians that come near the perimeter of SCP-1181 are to be escorted away by personnel posing as game preserve rangers.

**Description:** SCP-1181 is a circular clearing 2048 meters in diameter in a forest, located in a game preserve in [REDACTED]. 

When a person, or portion of a person, passes through the center of SCP-1181, SCP-1181 activates. No other person will be able to pass through into SCP-1181 from the outside, until SCP-1181 is deactivated. Any other person inside SCP-1181 when it is activated will not be able to leave.

The outside of the barrier of SCP-1181 is impenetrable by any objects until SCP-1181 is deactivated. The barrier is a sphere, surrounding SCP-1181. The barrier cannot be sensed, except by touch; the sensation is described as touching ice-cold glass or similar. It also cannot detected by any known instruments. Any objects present on the perimeter when SCP-1181 is activated will be split apart either side of the perimeter.

Once the subject moves more than 2 meters away from the center of SCP-1181, 3 other exact copies of the subject will appear around the center of SCP-1181, facing outwards from the center, arranged equally separate from each other, 90 degrees apart. Each of the 3 copies will move identically to the subject.

Whenever the subject or any copy moves past distances 2m, 4m, 8m, 16m, 32m, 64m, 128m, 256m, and 512m from the center, they will be copied again. The three additional copies will appear around a point 1 meter behind the subject or copy. This works in both directions, whether the subject or its copies move away from or toward the center of SCP-1181.

Should any simultaneously created copies occupy the same space, their bodies will be fused together. Usually the fusing results in rapid expiration of these copies. If a newly created copy occupies the space of the subject or an already existing copy, the newly created copy will be spawned missing the portions of their body where the existing occupant of the space was, usually resulting in quick death from blood loss, if not instantaneous death.

Living fused and/or mutilated copies and copies that block each others' paths will still attempt to the best of their ability to mimic the original person's movements.

If the subject or copies touches the inside of the barrier of SCP-1181 they will begin to combust. If the person or a copy on fire runs backwards and passes a copying mark they will spawn copies that are also aflame. Tests with D-Class personnel asked to touch and describe the physical texture of the inside of the barrier have so far been inconclusive.

SCP-1181 will deactivate if the subject passes through the center point a second time, or dies. Should the subject die, they, all their copies, and any remains will disappear. Should the subject pass through the center for a second time, all copies, and any remains of the copies, will disappear, and any injuries the subject sustained will be healed.

> **Subject:** D-Class-1033
> 
> **Procedure:** D-1033 was asked to walk in a straight line from point A, on one side of SCP-1181, through the center of SCP-1181, to point B, opposite side of of SCP-1181, and not stop for any reason.  D-1033 would be the only subject present in SCP-1181. A UAV fitted with a video camera would record the test from above.
> 
> **Results:** When  D-1033 passed through the center, SCP-1181's barrier activated. Once  D-1033 had walked 2 meters past the center of SCP-1181, 3 copies appeared around the center of SCP-1181, at 90 degree intervals. The subject did not notice the copies. 
> 
> When  D-1033 passed the 4 meter mark, he and the other three copies of himself manifested 3 additional copies. The subject turned and noticed the copies of himself which caused him to panic, he and his copies screamed and ran toward point B, despite warnings to remain at a walking pace.
> 
> The 4 copies that had spawned facing backwards ran toward the center of SCP-1181. When the copies came into contact with each other they attempted to mimic D-1033 movements further, despite physically obstructing each other to the point of futility. 
> 
> As  D-1033 continued toward point B, he activated several copying points. When The subject was 256 meters from the center of SCP-1181 there were over 16 thousand copies, some fused or otherwise mutilated. Uninjured copies continued to run in various directions, mimicking the subject. 
> 
> Immediately after  D-1033 had passed the 512 meter mark, there were over 60 thousand copies, interfering with each others progress, and spawning more copies. At this point the much of the ground was covered with fused and mutilated corpses, as well as blood. Copies continued to mimic  D-1033 and spawn more copies, or attempt to despite impediments and/or injury.
> 
> When  the subject arrived at point B, he and all copies of himself yelled; "Yes, finally!" As  D-1033 and all copies which came into contact with the perimeter, they burst into flame, screaming and rolling around. All other living copies rolled and screamed regardless of if they were on fire.
> 
> Seven minutes after coming into contact with the perimeter the subject died of severe burns. The extensiveness of these burns was not able to be verified. The subject and all copies disappeared, including blood, organs and smoke. SCP-1181 and its barrier deactivated.

> 
> **Subject:** D-Class-1059
> 
> **Procedure:** The subject was told to walk in a straight line from point A, on one side of SCP-1181, through the center of SCP-1181, to point B,  10 meters from the center, then turn and head back through the center to point C, 2 meters from the center. The subject would wait at point C for 10 minutes, then walk through the center of SCP-1181 again toward point D, 500 meters from center, then turn around and return to the center of SCP-1181.  
> 
> D-1059 was told not stop for any reason.  D-1059 would be the only subject present in SCP-1181. The subject was informed of the clearing's nature prior to the test to lessen the chance of panic during the test. A UAV fitted with a video camera would record the test from above.
> 
> **Results:** After activating SCP-1181,  D-1059 moved to point B, being forewarned, she did not panic when she saw the copies of herself, although visibly startled. The subject turned and walked towards the center of SCP-1181.
> 
> 2 meters from the center,  D-1059 began to struggle through the scrum of her copies as she made her way to the center.
> 
> After two minutes, all the copies of  D-1059 disappeared. SCP-1181 deactivated.  D-1059 was seen crawling towards point B, where she waited for ten minutes, before walking through the center point, towards point D, reactivating SCP-1181. Upon reaching point D, the subject turned and headed toward the center of SCP-1181.
> 
> Once  D-1059 was 260 meters from the center of SCP-1181, she ran into resistance from her copies, and her progress towards the center slowed. Five minutes later,  visual confirmation of D-1059 was lost in a pile of bodies 50 meters from the center. Four minutes later,  D-1059 and all her clones disappeared, and SCP-1181 deactivated.  D-1059 presumed suffocated.

//Study of the UAV recordings of subjects interacting within SCP-1181 show SCP-1181 rotational symmetry. Any one quarter of SCP-1181 is identical to the other three, no matter how many copies there are or how they are moving, despite mutilation, pile-ups, blood etc. So far it seems that nothing can be done by the subject interacting with SCP-1181 to ruin SCP-1181's perfect symmetry. If one can distance and dehumanize themselves from what is occurring, it is actually quite beautiful.//
