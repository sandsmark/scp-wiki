**Item #:** SCP-XXXX

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-XXXX is to remain within the confines of its graveyard territory. The outskirts of SCP-XXXX's territory must be guarded by no less than four security personnel. In the event that SCP-XXXX exits its territory, personnel are required to fire upon SCP-XXXX to severely damage it and draw it back to its graveyard.

SCP-XXXX is to be herded away from visiting civilians by assigned field agents[[footnote]] Field agents assigned to SCP-XXXX are to be supplied with false ID's and deployed under cover as cemetery tenders.[[/footnote]]. In the event that any civilian observes SCP-XXXX, they are to be administered a class-A amnetic and removed from the cemetery perimeter.

**Description:** SCP-XXXX is a humanoid figure standing 2.57 meters in height, and weighing 85 kilograms. Its body is comprised of finely-knitted pale and dark grey straw. SCP-XXXX wears a black tuxedo and petty coat and a wide-brimmed bowler's hat comprised of the same material. SCP-XXXX's face has several large bulbous eyes on its head. These eyes are not fixed in place, and SCP-XXXX is able to shift them across its surface to point in a desired direction. SCP-XXXX's eyes emit a lavender-scented liquid that drastically accelerates floral growth when spread over a burial site.

SCP-XXXX resides within a cemetery in Sunderland, Massachusetts, measuring 120 meters by 200 meters. It displays no unprompted aggression to living organisms and will display passive behavior unless its territory[[footnote]] As defined by the cemetery borders. [[/footnote]] is vandalized or violated in any way. This includes committing acts of graverobbing, littering, damaging headstones, and graffiti.

When SCP-XXXX's territory is damaged or vandalized, it will begin to display hostile behavior. SCP-XXXX will attempt to hunt down the cause of the damage to its territory and attack them.

All attempts to relocate SCP-XXXX to a controlled facility have failed. When removed from its territory SCP-XXXX will fall apart and dissolve, and a new instance of SCP-XXXX will appear at its graveyard.

SCP-XXXX displays extreme resilience to damage and will not attack living individuals that attempt to damage it. If SCP-XXXX sustains significant damage it will return to its graveyard and enter the central mausoleum where it will encase itself in a stone coffin. After 24 hours, SCP-XXXX will exit its coffin in a state of full repair. SCP-XXXX's mausoleum displays no anomalous properties on its own. The entrance has a plaque which reads:

> Jackson M. Maywall
> October 19th, 1936 - [DATE SCRATCHED OUT]
> A kind-hearted public servant and friend to all who knew him, may his soul find eternal peace in the land of his love.

Under the approval of level-2 administrative personnel an investigation into the whereabouts of the corpse of Maywall has been put underway. The agent assigned to investigating the possible link to SCP-XXXX recorded the following conversation, with a local grave keeper.

> **Interviewed:** Harold F. Tanner, grave keeper
> 
> **Interviewer:** Agent Franklin E. Ville
> 
> **Foreword:** Agent Ville questioned several inhabitants around the town of Sunderland, Massachusetts, before concluding his investigation with an interview with one of the night-shift grave keepers of the town.
> 
> **<Begin Log>**
> 
> **Agent Ville:** So, I've asked around, and you seem to have been the closest person to the late Mr. Maywall. Is that true?
> 
> **Harold Tanner:** Aye, yeah. You could say closest, but to be fair he was everyone's friend. Real kind man, he was.
> 
> **Agent Ville:** Right. So I've come to gather that he was an admired figure in the community, yeah?
> 
> **Harold Tanner:** Absolutely! He and his wife worked in the library, down by the corner store. They kept the place colorful. The kids loved 'em.
> 
> **Agent Ville:** Can you tell me about them? Jackson and his wife, I mean. I haven't heard much about the wife from anyone.
> 
> **Harold Tanner:** Mmhm. Yeah... Sure, I can tell you whatever you need. Care if I ask a question of my own?
> 
> **Agent Ville:** Not at all. Ask away.
> 
> **Harold Tanner:** Why're you asking around about the Maywalls? Extended family get into some trouble?
> 
> **Agent Ville:** Not at all. Jackson knew my mom when she was a little girl, she told me a lot of stories, just thought I'd come ask about, then pay my respects.
> 
> **Harold Tanner:** Mm... Good a reason as ever. Anyways... Georgia Maywall was a nice enough woman. Real religious, but Jackson never was. They had a lot of differences, but you couldn't ask for a closer couple.
> 
> **Agent Ville:** That sounds nice. Not many people get that any more.
> 
> **Harold Tanner:** Mmhm. It was real nice, up until a few years back. She'd gotten liver cancer, but Jackson stayed with her all the way through. Wouldn't leave her side for more than a few hours, right up 'til the end.
> 
> **Agent Ville:** And after she'd passed away?
> 
> **Harold Tanner:** Well, he didn't last much longer after she passed, maybe three years? He died in bed, though. Died happy, with some of his oldest friends by his side.
> 
> **Agent Ville:** What about before he died? What was he doing then?
> 
> **Harold Tanner:** Well, afterwards... He dropped his job at the library, and took one up where Georgia was buried, as the day time tender. Kept things tidy in the cemetery. It's a bit of a grim job, but he always smiled. I guess, in a way, he really was with her until the very end.
> 
> **Agent Ville:** I guess we should all hope to be that lucky. My grandfather died overseas a long time back. So, did anyone see Maywall much during his time in the cemetery?
> 
> **Harold Tanner:** Oh boy, yeah, plenty! We all visited him, couple of times a week at least but he spent every day in the cemetery. Every Thursday, he'd bring a bouquet of lavenders to her headstone, and spend the evening reading to her. I'm sure he'd have given anything to pass on, right there next to her. I can't imagine how it must've been for him, losin' the closest person he's ever had.
> 
> **Agent Ville:** I certainly couldn't imagine it. I should probably be hitting the road soon, but I want to thank you for taking the time to talk with me.
> 
> **Harold Tanner:** Ain't a problem... Any friend of the Maywalls is welcome to take my time as they please.
> 
> **<End Log>**
> 
> **Closing Statement:** as per investigations regarding the Maywall family, SCP-XXXX displays thematic similarities to Jackson Maywall before his passing such as the lavenders Jackson would leave at Georgia's grave, and the lavender-colored fluid that leaks from SCP-XXXX's eyes, as well as its constant presence in the area surrounding both Jackson and Georgia's grave and mausoleum.
