See Interview Log 393-1a for further information.

Note: //Well, at least this proves it doesn't change history. Just the subject’s memory of it. Additionally, SCP-393 seems to fill in details for the memory, such as for the girlfriend's name, and the location of the park. More tests will have to be done to find its limits.//- Dr ████
