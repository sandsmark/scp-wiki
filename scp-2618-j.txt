**Item #:** SCP-2618-J

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** The five known trees that produce SCP-2618-J are to be kept in an open-air arboreal habitat of Site-59. To minimize risk of a Hubris Event, watering and other maintenance operations of the trees are to be carried out through automated systems. 

**Description:** SCP-2618-J is a banana cultivar that originated from the former French colony of █████ ██████████. In its appearance and genetic makeup, SCP-2618-J is indistinguishable from the common Cavendish banana. 

SCP-2618-J's anomalous effects surface when a human subject makes visual contact with an individual SCP-2618-J fruit. The subject will invariably perceive the banana to be an item the subject needs to accomplish a future or pre-existing goal. This has been designated a "Hubris Event". 

The perception can only be broken through the following means:
# A different human subject will remind the affected subject that SCP-2618-J is a banana.
# The affected subject attempts to use SCP-2618-J as they had originally intended.

SCP-2618-J first came to the attention of the Foundation after a failed assassination attempt of United States Senator ████████ ███ on 12/20/██. A radical animal rights activist named Kevin Jarvis had charged the stage at a campaign rally and attempted to shoot the senator point-blank, only to discover that his pistol was actually an instance of SCP-2618-J. While major news outlets gave a cover story of the attack being an unusual prank, a 40-page manifesto was discovered in Mr. Jarvis's apartment detailing his desire to assassinate the Senator in retaliation for his alleged track record of animal cruelty.

**Addendum - Incident 2618-J-████:** On 4/19/██, during the initial containment efforts of SCP-2618-J, Site-59 experienced multiple containment breaches by SCP-████, a Keter-class amphibian entity. After several unintentional Hubris Events on the part security staff, SCP-████ has been designated uncontained and reclamation efforts are underway.

SCP-2618-J has been declared uncontained as of 4/22/██, when the automated watering and maintenance systems were revealed to have been independent instances of SCP-2618-J all along. The five SCP-2618-J trees were never brought to Site-59 from their original plantation in █████ ██████████, as the recovered trees were also instances of SCP-2618-J all along. 

Final containment efforts of SCP-2618-J are to be carried out via autonomous drones as soon as possible. Should the drones return with independent SCP-2618-J instances rather than the actual trees, Contingency Fuqqdithshet-Alpha is to be enacted as soon as possible.
