||||||||~ Initial Report||

||~ Interest||High/Medium||~ Identifier||Personal Concert Experience||
||||||||The concept first came to our attention through contacts in the Three Portlands anart scene; during a review of proposals for the upcoming 1974 "//Sommes-Nous Devenus Magnifiques?//" convention, an anonymous member of the primary //Are We Cool Yet// cell in Three Portlands passed information on a rejected proposal to Perispirit Records executives on the grounds of high market potential. I have directed Perispirit employees to establish contact with one Michael Jameson, PhD. listed as the proposal's author. A former Professor of Music at Deer College in Three Portlands, Dr. Jameson submitted his proposal on 3 January and was notified of its rejection on 16 January. Proposal is attached below (External Report 01). It should be noted that the proposal was rejected for failure to adhere to established formatting guidelines, along with a lack of "individual originality"; it seems proof-of-concept was not the issue here.||

**Title:** //A Personal Musical Experience//

**Material Requirements:** 
* 1 blank vinyl disc
* 1 Long Play vinyl record
* one or more items (preferably of sentimental value) obtained from a live performance by the same artist(s) whose LP record is used
* 1 Mnestic Resonance Recording Device (modified)
* 1 alarm stopwatch made of Beryllium-Bronze alloy
* a variable amount of blood, to be drawn by way of a blade forged of Beryllium-Bronze alloy
* 1 ordinary record player

**Abstract:** //A Personal Concert Experience// is an effort to capture the fleeting magic of a live performance, allowing listeners to relive their favorite concerts again and again with their friends and family. Though the power of one's memory is used in its creation, it can be enjoyed afterwards by any who can appreciate musical expression.

The creation process is simple, provided the creator has attended the concert he wishes to replicate. During his time at the concert, he should have his Mnestic Resonance Recording Device active and his Beryllium-Bronze stopwatch running for the duration of the concert (and no longer). With this done, the creator may start his work at any time.

Upon his return from the performance, after gathering his materials, the creator should prick his finger with the Beryllium-Bronze blade and trace his finger along the circumference of the blank vinyl disc such that his blood should coat the outer edge. Once the edge is bloodied, the LP record (which should contain music performed at the concert in question) should be placed atop the blank disc, both of which should be placed upon the turntable of the record player. Then, the Mnestic Resonance Recording Device should be connected to the stopwatch by way of the modifications I have made (see attached document[[footnote]] Internal Note: Document not received. [[/footnote]]). 

The sentimental paraphernalia should be arranged in a radial pattern surrounding the record player to enhance the Mnestic induction process; while only one object of sentiment is necessary, more items will drastically improve the quality of the finished product.

Finally, place the stopwatch and Mnestic Recording Device within close proximity to the record player, making physical contact if possible. If the record player has a cabinet or is placed atop a cabinet, the watch and recording device should be placed within the cabinet. The stopwatch should then be let to run for the same amount of time as the concert, without interference from other persons until it rings. The record player's turntable should be turned on for this duration. Upon the ringing of the watch, the two discs should merge to become one, and upon being brought into contact with the player's tonearm shall have the effect on those listening of sending them to the concert memorialised,,[sic],, with the Mnestic Resonance Recording Device.

**Intent:** The dream of reliving a concert has been with me for many decades and more. I am, of course, well aware that the technology to relive and record memories is within the grasp of modern science. However, no photograph or video recording (even those recorded in color) can truly capture the magick,,[sic],, of an experience. And though arcane means of vividly reliving one's memories are available in many of the more unusual places of the world, these cannot be shared with others and they lack tangibility. After all, I should know; I am one of but a handful of mortal men who possesses the ability to relive my memories on my own.

I have always known I possess gifts of memory that far exceed most men, and I wished to share that with those I knew, especially my beloved Genevieve. Our marriage has been long and prosperous, but of late in her old age she has been subject to a decline of memory which has pained my heart. It was my desire to give to her a gift which would allow us to relive the moment we first met: a performance of Franz Josef,,[sic],, Haydn's greatest works. 

Our son Robert, who works as a scientist in the employ of a prestigious Laboratory, helped me develop the process for the creation of this wondrous device; without him I would have given up out of frustration years ago. When I told him of my desire, he told me he had just the solution: a way to use my memory as a metaphysical gateway to the past. And with little delay he and I set to work on our creation. Using my gifts, I revisited the moment I wished to capture, outfitted with a device created by my son's colleagues. The result of our efforts exceeded my wildest expectations, and my final moments with her were spent in bliss.

But now I wish to share our invention with the world! Indeed, I created it not for my own indulgence, but to share with others. This accomplishment may be the means by which art truly transcends death. By our creation, music may survive exactly as its composers intend, and the greatest performances of instrumentalists may be experienced in the flesh by the whole world. And the endless march of time may be stopped, if but for a brief moment, to capture that which is no more.

||||||||~ Memo 01||
||||||||~ DM437/25P16F/PSR77 ||
||~ Sender || Maximilian Driscoll ||~ Recipient || Ruprecht Carter||
|||||||| I have met with Dr. Jameson, the man in whom our friends at Perispirit have been so interested lately. Though I'm not entirely convinced of his scientific grasp of the technology behind his creation, his technique certainly works (at least, to the point he showed me). It seems his son Robert, a former employee of Prometheus Labs, handled most of the scientific aspects of the original prototype; however, the younger Jameson has not been seen for several months, an incident about which the elder Jameson refuses to speak, though he did seem to grow emotional when I brought it up. I suggest looking into this as the opportunity arises. _
 _
These reservations aside, Dr. Jameson is certainly open to working with us, and his requests apart from the needs of his project are surprisingly limited. However, his...personal tendencies may make working with him a bit challenging. From our interview, I have concluded that Dr. Jameson is a bit of a perfectionist, and he fails to understand that his concept may be applied to a wider range of media. His dedication to this project is borderline maniacal, so we shouldn't have any problem motivating him to get us results. However, he may need some additional persuasion to put aside his personal wishes and see things our way. All things considered, what he has to offer has too much potential to ignore. ||

||||||||~ Memo 02||
||||||||~ DM437/25P16F/PSR77 ||
||~ Sender || Ruprecht Carter ||~ Recipient || Maximilian Driscoll ||
|||||||| I have discussed this with Marshall, and we are inclined to agree with your conclusion. I trust you to handle it from here. Such a product may finally give us the control we've been looking for over the ever-growing anomalous music market. But we'll need to get the product on the shelf quickly if we are to maximize our profits; musical tastes change quickly. Make sure Doctor Jameson understands this fact. _
 _
As for the younger Jameson, I have authorized a quiet investigation into his current whereabouts. He could be a vital asset to us, or he could be a liability if the technology were sold to a third party. I will have all information on this matter sent to you as well.||

------

||||||||~ Memo 04||
||||||||~ DM437/25P16F/PSR77 ||
||~ Sender || Maximilian Driscoll ||~ Recipient || Ruprecht Carter||
|||||||| My men in Perispirit have reached out to various contacts in the industry. So far, our proposals have been met with interest across the board. We have selected an initial run of eight acts, despite Dr. Jameson's apparent distaste for our choice of genres. Due to the personal interest of our established client, Mister Waters, we have chosen his band to serve as the basis of our first prototype. We have made sure to record the selected concerts of our other contacts in advance, though negotiations are still ongoing. However, based on what I've heard from Waters, Mason, and Parsons of this upcoming album of theirs, it has the potential to be a classic of its own right. _
 _
I will impress on Jameson the importance of suppressing his distaste for modern music, as well as ensuring all necessary precautions are taken to prevent our product from being misused. And, as always I will keep you abreast of this project.||

||||||||~ Memo 09||
||||||||~ DM437/25P16F/PSR77 ||
||~ Sender || Maximilian Driscoll ||~ Recipient || Michael Jameson ||
|||||||| Dr. Jameson, my superiors are not pleased with your lack of results. Despite all the time and money that have gone into this project, you have only managed to create a single half-working prototype, which leaves listeners even more obsessed with finishing the concert than you! Now, I want this project to succeed just as much as you, but at this rate the music we've got recorded so far will become passe long before we can release one of your products. I admire your artistic dedication to this project, but I cannot ignore the lack of results. Nor can Mister Carter or Mister Marshall. _
 _
My superiors have informed me that you will be given three more months to produce a finished product; otherwise, the project will be cancelled and you will be dismissed.||

||||||||~ Memo 10||
||||||||~ DM437/25P16F/PSR77 ||
||~ Sender || Michael Jameson ||~ Recipient || Maximilian Driscoll ||
|||||||| Mister Driscoll, I assure you that I am trying my very hardest. You would do well to remember that I did create, at one point, a working prototype, but it was rejected due to its supposed lack of "marketability". If you wish to have a production model that badly, I am certain you would find customers interested enough in Haydn's musical genius to purchase it for the exorbitant prices your company sees fit to charge. But without Robert, I do not know if I shall be able to ensure the safety of our listeners; he made it very clear to me before his incident that the fabric of time is far more delicate than it seems to us mortals. I'm sure your superiors can understand the importance of customer safety. _
 _
I apologise for my bluntness, but these past few years have worn me quite thin. I shall continue to put forth my best effort in this endeavour, even until death or insanity should take me. We are on the cusp of greatness; I cannot turn back now.||

||||||||~ Incident Report 01||
||||||||~ DM437/25P16F/PSR77 ||
||~ Author || Maximilian Driscoll ||~ Date || November 9, 1973||
|||||||| The results of the investigation into the younger Jameson finally came back, and they are far from encouraging. I had hoped that, if we could find him, we would be able to kick this project into gear. However, it seems that will not be the case. _
 _
According to our findings, Robert Jameson has been dead since 1936, when he was apparently caught in the crossfire during a shootout between two members of the Chicago Spirit in Three Portlands. Of course, this seems absurd; Robert Jameson was not even born until 1939 and his parents had only just met the previous year (they would not be married until 1937). When I saw this, I thought that the shared name was only a coincidence. _
 _
But the evidence doesn't lie. The coroner's report included a photograph and biological information, which was checked against Prometheus Labs records and testimony from Dr. Jameson himself. He was reported to have no next of kin at the time of death, and no records of him existed until a year prior to his death. _
 _
I don't know everything about the arcane, but I do know it is highly unusual for a man to die as an adult before he is even born. Given the information we currently possess, we have come to the conclusion that Jameson was the victim of a temporal incident that resulted in his being stranded in the 1930s. It's not so unbelievable; he was a member of the Prometheus Labs Temporal Projects division, and he and his father were working on a limited form of temporal recursion in their spare time. It would also explain Dr. Jameson's reluctance to broach the topic, as well as his obsession with the all-too-vague "difficulties" plaguing his project. _
 _
Either way, it is my opinion that this information should be kept from Jameson. If we can work through whatever problem may (or may not) have caused his son's death, this product will surely pay for itself within the first two weeks of release. But if he can't fix it with the resources provided, then I say we should cut our losses.||

||||||||= //The following document is transcribed as written.//||
||||||||To the Honorable Executives Officers of Marshall, Carter & Dark, Ltd. _
 _
Though it pains me to say, I must resign from your employ for my own good. Though the terms of our contract have not yet been breached, the failure of my final attempt to resolve the issues plaguing this project last night has sealed the fate of our cooperation. I will be unable to provide a finished product by the designated deadline of 31 January. I embarked upon this endeavour so that I could relive what I thought to be the greatest moment of my life. But it has only brought me disappointment, anxiety, and loss. _
 _
It is my hope that our separation shall be amicable; to facilitate this, I request nothing but to take what you have paid me and to be left alone. I will leave all my work to you, to do with as you will. I wish not to be involved with it any longer. _
 _
I offer you my sincerest thanks for your generosity and my sincerest apologies for my inability to fulfill your expectations. I wish you all the best in your future endeavours. _

Sincerely yours, _

||||||||~ Incident Report 03||
||||||||~ DM437/25P16F/PSR77 ||
||~ Author || Maximilian Driscoll ||~ Date || January 21, 1974||
|||||||| Well, this weekend has been rather "lively" for Perispirit Records; it seems that, on the night of 18 January, the main office was raided by a number of possibly anomalous persons of as-yet unknown affiliation. Though the investigation is still in its early stages, we do not suspect the involvement of a major organized group; the perpetrators ignored most of what we would consider to be important in favor of records and tapes stored in the archives. However, this unfortunately includes our single working Personal Concert Experience prototype, which was left in its packaging in the archives pending a more permanent storage solution. _
 _
I will be closely involved with this investigation; that prototype, with its unresolved issues, could be dangerous in the wrong hands. We certainly don't want any temporal mishaps it might cause coming back on us. Item documentation will be updated accordingly, once we know more. Tracking an object through the Three Portlands black market will not be easy, but I think we will not be the only ones doing so. I believe our friends in the UIU could be convinced to do the hard work for us. _
 _
As for Perispirit Records, I recommend that actions be undertaken to ensure this kind of security breach is avoided in the future.||

|||||||| I've been overseeing digitalization of some older records and I came across this item.

||~ Sender || Marcus Fordley ||~ Recipient || Robert Carter||
|||||||| First batch of market survey results are in; demand seems to be higher than ever, especially with the recent resurgence of vinyl record sales. And production is cheap too. This could be a real long-term winner (I'm talking decades down the road), but it may have even more potential; we're basically selling a limited form of time travel here. Some folks would pay billions for that kind of capability. But as a consumer product, I'd say a rental model would maximize our profits; we wouldn't even have to produce that many copies. We'll keep you updated on any new developments.||

||~ Sender || Millicent Concord ||~ Recipient || Iris Dark ||
|||||||| Based on what I read of the experimentation logs, I think I'll be able to fix the problem. It's not too different than some of the stuff I worked on at Prometheus, other than the fact that there's a lot more "faerie magick" than I'm used to. The guy who made this seems like he had no idea what the hell he was doing. I'll need materials to replicate the design, but once I figure that out it should be more time consuming than difficult.||

||||||||~ Memo 27||
||||||||~ DM437/25P16F/PSR77 ||
||~ Sender || Millicent Concord ||~ Recipient || Iris Dark ||
|||||||| Latest tests were successful; we officially have a working product. We solved the psychological effects the first copies had on our test subjects by normalizing the mnestic resonance signature of each variant; that keeps the experience from being corrupted by the emotions of the person recording, so it should prevent the psychological issues that the original prototype had back in the 70s. Still can't figure out how to apply the tech to a digital format, but I've been told I don't have to. Probably for the best to leave marketing decisions up to you. _
 _
I feel obliged to let you know that, because this product is little more than a pre-packaged temporal recursion device (no matter what the crackpot who invented may have thought), time travel has a number of inherent dangers. Anybody using this product could have an unimaginable effect on history as we know it, whether they mean to or not. I don't know what legal ramifications that has, but the possibility of alterations to history would be drastically reduced if customers were provided with era-appropriate clothing and told to keep interaction with others to a minimum. Make them sign a waiver or a contract or something; I just don't want any paradox this may or may not cause coming back on me. _

I've done my part. Don't say I didn't warn you.||

|||||||| It can be "paused" from the outside, but at the cost of trapping listeners in the concert. I can try to figure out a way for listeners to extract themselves, but time travel is difficult. Especially since this "technology" doesn't really follow most of the rules of time travel (at least, as we understood them at Prometheus). I would've much preferred mnestic immersion or "astral projection" (for lack of a better term) since we understand them better, but the execs say it wouldn't be as "immersive". TL;DR: I'll do what I can, but don't get your hopes up.||

||~ Author || Stuart Estes ||~ Date || February 28, 2027||
|||||||| There's an issue with the "B" variant that somehow went unnoticed in the decade between recording and release; apparently, one of MY people forgot about the railing collapse that injured 42 people (even though our quality control team swears they couldn't find anything on that incident before we released it. Now that count is up to 43 because our customer came back with several broken bones. Our lawyers are handling it, but it's best if we just quietly pull this variant from the shelves. That should prevent any further trouble. After all, demand wasn't anywhere near projections; the "vintage" release tactic just fell flat on this one.||

||~ Author || Stuart Estes ||~ Date || April 4, 2027||
|||||||| Yet again, one of our less popular variants (variant "D") is subject to a critical oversight. But I think this one is too big to be a coincidence; I mean, ignoring a railing collapse is one thing, but a terrorist attack is too big of a deal for that many people to have just "forgotten" about it. Latest customer went in and came back a corpse. Our lawyers are pissed, and I can't blame them. I'll get in touch with Millie and see if her team can figure out what's wrong. _
 _
__UPDATE__: The investigators we sent in didn't come back out. A thorough search of historical records revealed that two of the three of them were killed in the attack, while the third popped up in an SCP Foundation registry of all places. We're still trying to figure out how the hell the Foundation got their hands on them, but my gut says that misplaced prototype has something to do with it. Millie has mentioned that the problem most likely isn't our quality control, but the nature of the product makes that hard to determine. But we did have to successfully record these concerts in order to use them, and we certainly wouldn't have been recording through a terrorist attack. Considering preemptively recalling the remainder of our stock, but some of our clients likely wouldn't comply. Either way, we need to fix this.||

||||||||~ DM437/25P16F/PSR77 ||
||~ Author || Stuart Estes ||~ Date || September 19, 2027||
|||||||| Tests using the G variant have confirmed that the Foundation has been running a retroactive interference campaign against concerts we've recorded. I'm honestly impressed that they even figured out what we were doing, but this is **bad** news. This probably means we'll have to recall every release for testing, which is a load of trouble by itself; preorders for the second run were through the roof, and now we'll have a bunch of angry customers to deal with along with the Foundation. _
 _
There is a bright side to this development. I've consulted with our lawyers and they've determined that neither Perispirit nor MC&D are legally responsible for any injuries to customers or concertgoers due to these attacks. That fault falls on the Foundation. I don't know if it's been attempted, but maybe there's some legal action we could try to take against them. I'm sure there are more direct options as well, but I'm not very familiar with those. _

Either way, we can't let this stop us. The other first-release variants have been tested and are confirmed safe, and the C variant singlehandedly paid for this project in the first quarter of circulation. It's too profitable to give up. We'll just have to fight the problem at its source; after all, we have all the time in the world, don't we?||
