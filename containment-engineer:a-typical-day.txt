title:Containment Engineer: A Typical Day
Avery Zhang considered himself pretty lucky to work at Site-11. Working at Site-11 meant that instead of living out of an on-Site dormitory, he got to go home at the end of most days. Zhang liked being able to go home to his quiet, suburban house. It was a nice house in a nice community--a community where half his neighbors were his co-workers, granted, but Zhang appreciated any semblance of normality wherever he could find it.

Being an employee of the SCP Foundation gave him a gracious perspective on life^^1^^. 

[[footnote]] When your job involves confronting the universe's eldritch horrors and the apocalypse's rejects, you tend to feel grateful for things like fresh air, sunshine, and your morning commute. [[/footnote]]
