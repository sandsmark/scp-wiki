title:Containment Engineer: A Typical Day
Avery Zhang considered himself pretty lucky to work at Site-11. Working at Site-11 meant that instead of living out of an on-Site dormitory, he got to go home at the end of the day. Zhang liked being able to go home to his nice house in his nice community--a nice community where half his neighbors were his co-workers, granted, but Zhang appreciated any semblance of normality wherever he could find it.
