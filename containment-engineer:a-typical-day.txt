title:Containment Engineer: A Typical Day
Avery Zhang considered himself pretty lucky to work at Site-11. Working at Site-11 meant that instead of living out of an on-Site dormitory, he got to go home at the end of most days. Zhang liked being able to go home to his quiet, suburban house. It was a nice house in a nice community--a community where half his neighbors were his co-workers, granted, but Zhang appreciated any semblance of normality wherever he could find it.

Being an employee of the SCP Foundation gave him a gracious perspective on life [[footnote]] When your job involves confronting the universe's eldritch horrors and the apocalypse's rejects, you tend to feel grateful for things like fresh air, sunshine, and your morning commute. [[/footnote]]. It also gave him a sweet office in a secret underground facility and access to some really cool toys, but those perks weren't the reason why he stayed with the Foundation. Zhang stayed with the Foundation because he woke up every morning [[footnote]] Or night, depending on what sort of anomalies he was assigned to. [[/footnote]]
