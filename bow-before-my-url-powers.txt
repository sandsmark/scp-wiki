Researcher Ryan joined the Foundation as a Junior Researcher in the last year of college. Since then, he has not participated in a single specific research project for more than three weeks, preferring instead to take a small part in the containment and testing of various Safe and Euclid class SCP’s as needed. So far, he has shown a basic proficiency in the majority of tasks that he has been assigned to, without any specific specialties. Attempts to discern what degree he actually earned in college have been temporarily halted until all SCP-447-2 has been cleared from the employee records’ hard drive. [[size 0%]] Turns out that green goo really can do anything.[[/size]]

Researcher Ryan has shown a strong interest in testing with [[[SCP-261]]], having returned to the project several times. As he has followed all testing protocols to the letter, Site Staff see no reason to bar him from the SCP, so long as he joins a gym. [[size 0%]] Exercise is NOT good for you. It makes you live LONGER, for gods’ sakes! [[/size]]

[[size 0%]] Note: Researcher Ryan (That is myself) possesses a strong dislike for phrases used in popular culture, specifically "swag", but //apparently// this isn’t important enough to be noted in my official documentation. Seriously though, don’t say those words.[[/size]]

Researcher Ryan is adept at improving group morale in any project that he is included in. Seen below is a list of false SCP Documents filed by Researcher Ryan noted to amuse coworkers.

[[[SCP-1212-J]]]
//Does anyone actually get this joke? It’s a serious item with horrible deadly properties. I’d be just as frustrated as the Researcher in the interview log. What// is //a downvote?// -Dr. ████ [[size 0%]] The reason you don’t get the joke is the same reason that you can’t see these words. YOU aren’t meta. [[/size]]

NOTICE TO ALL PERSONNEL:
[[[SCP-423]]] has breached containment and is currently making its way through Foundation records. The contamination appears to have begun in this personnel file. As such, a record of contaminated documents will be retained here, rather than creating a new page through which the object may learn that we have discovered it.

As far as can be ascertained at this time, SCP-423 is searching for something within Foundation records. It can only be detected by looking at the page source, as it uses zero-point font. From the files already breached, we have determined how SCP-423 behaves upon contaminating a new page.

* SCP-423 always begins with a personnel file. Personnel without a file are not at risk (If you don't have an author page, you can't add to the story).
* SCP-423 is incapable of interacting with ordinary SCP-Object files, using them solely as a means to further its story. 
 * The narrative universe inside of "Tales" and other nonstandard pages __may__ physically interact with SCP-423, and vice-versa.
* SCP-423 may only remain on each page for one sentence unless detained by a dialogue with another character(characters show no awareness outside of their Tales) or some other narrative obstacle (example: a powerful character that //is// aware of the greater SCPverse)
* SCP-423 always moves down the works listed in the personnel file. If more works are added at a later date, SCP-423 may or may not immediately contaminate that document. However, it still follows narrative order.(If you make a new page, you still need to pick up where the last person left off)

All Foundation personnel are required to list documents under their jurisdiction that have been contaminated by SCP-423 in narrative order:

>__Honor Unwilling__

>People filed in to the onsite chapel. It was small, sparse, and nondenominational enough to work for about half of the world's religions. It was very rarely used, and even then, not by a great deal of people. Today was different. The people crowded in until it was standing room only. A small number of them were here to mourn. A slightly larger number had come to make sure that bastard was really gone. The vast majority, however, were people who had seen or lived with the results of his work and were just curious to see the legend that they had built up in their minds brought down to mortality.
>
>Someone stepped up to the altar and cleared his throat.
>
>"We are not gathered here today to discuss the circumstances in which Minister Plenipotentiary Carlos R. Kalinin left us," he began. "Like many of his actions, it has left a considerable amount of hubbub in its wake. Whether his vehement opposition to Alpha-9 was justified or paranoid, whether he saw something he couldn't deal with or just ended it in a fit of passion and rage, ugly topics like that. So I would like to ask everyone here to forget about that for the duration of this service, and focus on what mattered: the considerable legacy he left behind."
>
>"I was not privileged to call the minister my 'friend,' as such. As a matter of fact, I think that, if he were here now, he would punch me in the face. This, the eulogy, the ceremony, all of this is exactly the kind of thing that he would have //hated.// You may wonder, then, why we have chosen to honor him in such a way. The simple truth is, that that was when he most useful to us. When he hated. And I think that that was what finally got him."
>
>"Minister Plenipotentiary Kalinin was... difficult. To please, to get along with, to discuss things with. He was very rarely satisfied, and his dissatisfaction was something he tended to spread around liberally. It could get infuriating, the way that he would strip your work down, enumerate every single problem that you had, then leave you to put it back together again right. He was almost certainly working like a dog to do it, but when we get bad news, we tend not to worry about the bearer. The minister wasn't always right, but the way that he tore you apart could make you want to just disagree out of spite, even when he //was//."
>
>"However, nobody in this room can deny that what he did, he was one of the best at. He did his work amazingly, and quite often he did other people's work amazingly too. He'd fight and argue and even lose his temper if he had to, just to ensure that the Foundation would not only survive, but prosper. And regardless of how many of you deny it, we //have// prospered from the three years plus change he gave us. We're stronger for them." 
>
>"He could be a bit blunt at times, and that's choosing my words carefully, but, as I said, just being good and right most of the time doesn't make you popular. The best it will get you is a sort of respect from those people who know you better, and the disdain of those who don't know you so well."
>
>"I didn't know Kalinin very well, but I respected him. And it is out of respect, not malice, that  I deliver his eulogy in such a style as he would have so ardently objected to. And to Kalinin, I will say, your name will not be forgotten. Your legacy will not be expunged. Farewell to one of the best Foundation employees I have ever known."
