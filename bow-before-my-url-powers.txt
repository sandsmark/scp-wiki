Researcher Ryan joined the Foundation as a Junior Researcher in the last year of college. Since then, he has not participated in a single specific research project for more than three weeks, preferring instead to take a small part in the containment and testing of various Safe and Euclid class SCP’s as needed. So far, he has shown a basic proficiency in the majority of tasks that he has been assigned to, without any specific specialties. Attempts to discern what degree he actually earned in college have been temporarily halted until all SCP-447-2 has been cleared from the employee records’ hard drive. [[size 0%]] Turns out that green goo really can do anything.[[/size]]

Researcher Ryan has shown a strong interest in testing with [[[SCP-261]]], having returned to the project several times. As he has followed all testing protocols to the letter, Site Staff see no reason to bar him from the SCP, so long as he joins a gym. [[size 0%]] Exercise is NOT good for you. It makes you live LONGER, for gods’ sakes! [[/size]]

[[size 0%]] Note: Researcher Ryan (That is myself) possesses a strong dislike for phrases used in popular culture, specifically "swag", but //apparently// this isn’t important enough to be noted in my official documentation. Seriously though, don’t say those words.[[/size]]

Researcher Ryan is adept at improving group morale in any project that he is included in. Seen below is a list of false SCP Documents filed by Researcher Ryan noted to amuse coworkers.

[[[SCP-1212-J]]]
//Does anyone actually get this joke? It’s a serious item with horrible deadly properties. I’d be just as frustrated as the Researcher in the interview log. What// is //a downvote?// -Dr. ████ [[size 0%]] The reason you don’t get the joke is the same reason that you can’t see these words. YOU aren’t meta. [[/size]]

NOTICE TO ALL PERSONNEL:
[[[SCP-423]]] has breached containment and is currently making its way through Foundation records. The contamination appears to have begun in this personnel file. As such, a record of contaminated documents will be retained here, rather than creating a new page through which the object may learn that we have discovered it.

As far as can be ascertained at this time, SCP-423 is searching for something within Foundation records. It can only be detected by looking at the page source, as it uses zero-point font. From the files already breached, we have determined how SCP-423 behaves upon contaminating a new page.

* SCP-423 always begins with a personnel file. Personnel without a file are not at risk (If you don't have an author page, you can't add to the story).
* SCP-423 is incapable of interacting with ordinary SCP-Object files, using them solely as a means to further its story. 
 * The narrative universe inside of "Tales" and other nonstandard pages __may__ physically interact with SCP-423, and vice-versa.
* SCP-423 may only remain on each page for one sentence unless detained by a dialogue with another character(characters show no awareness outside of their Tales) or some other narrative obstacle (example: a powerful character that //is// aware of the greater SCPverse)
* SCP-423 always moves down the works listed in the personnel file. If more works are added at a later date, SCP-423 may or may not immediately contaminate that document. However, it still follows narrative order.(If you make a new page, you still need to pick up where the last person left off)

All Foundation personnel are required to list documents under their jurisdiction that have been contaminated by SCP-423 in narrative order:
