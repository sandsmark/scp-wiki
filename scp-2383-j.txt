**Item #:** SCP-2383-J

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2383-J is to be kept in a room measuring 10m x 10m, on a pedestal two (2) metres high. The containment room must be on the ground floor of the facility, as the effective range of SCP-2383-J is capable of penetrating surfaces (See report 2383-Alpha). A warning stripe is to be painted at a radius of six (6) metres from the SCP, and no personnel should enter this circle outside of testing. The containment room is to be guarded by at least one armed guard at all times, who must also be issued a tranquilizer gun containing sedative DH-6. Movement of SCP-2383-J is to be done by robotic means.

Any usable products of SCP-2383-J testing are to be stored in with appropriate containment procedures, and are designated SCP-2383-X, where X denotes the numerical order of the item's acquisition. Any overly dangerous items are to be destroyed, unless storage is approved by the overseeing Level 4 researcher. SCP-2383-1 to -5 are currently contained off site. SCP-2383-6 and -7 have been destroyed.

**Description:** Remote surveillance has shown SCP-2383-J to be an empty █████ brand beaker. However, interviews with test subjects have resulted in varying descriptions, from a test tube containing a boiling green liquid to a Erlenmeyer flask containing smoke. 

When a subject enters the effective range, SCP-2383-J will appear in their right hand. Affected subject will then demand that any other personnel move back, as the subject intends to perform an experiment. Any personnel in the vicinity of a SCP-2383-J affected subject are advised to move back several metres or more, please see test log [[[SCP-2383-J-T]]] for more details.

Once the SCP appears in the hand of a subject, it will visibly fill with a liquid. The liquid that fills SCP-2383-J is chemically unidentifiable, with both mass spectrometry and chemical analysis returning conflicting or nonsensical results.  While still holding the SCP, the subject will move in a direct line towards the nearest item that can be used in an "experiment" at considerable speed. On ██/██/████, this was shown to be up to ██km/h, suggesting that SCP-2383-J is partly responsible for the speed of a subject, as well as the distance required for contact with "experiment" items (see report SCP-2383-Alpha). Please note that most commonly available items appear to quantify as "experiment worthy", and as such, testing of SCP-2383-J requires approval by at least two Level 4 researchers.

While the subject is engaged in experimentation, SCP-2383-J is put down, and retains the colored liquid inside. It is possible to remove the SCP at this point, however this will not stop the subject, nor will SCP-2383-J revert to its natural state until the current subject has completed their work. Each experiment will involve the addition of the liquid inside SCP-2383-J, unless the SCP is removed before that point. In these cases, no changes in the end product have yet been observed. Sedation of the affected subject is an effective means of stopping experiments.

The visible colour of SCP-2383-J affects the final product of any experiment performed, and appears to be based on the nature of nearby items. Colors observed in testing so far include red, blue, green and white. Below is a short table detailing the expected results of experiments, however the actual items used in the experiment cause the end result to vary.

**Red:** Red is currently considered to be the most dangerous state of SCP-2383-J. The most common product of SCP-2383-J displaying this color is an explosion. Any tests where the subject causes SCP-2383-J to create a red liquid are to immediately enact protocol 2383-Rho.

**Blue:** Results of a test where SCP-2383-J creates a blue liquid are currently unknown, as the results mostly vaporize or cease to exist in our universe. Tests where a blue liquid is formed are to utilize protocol 2383-Beta if the experiment result can be collected. The only notable product with continued existence is SCP-2383-1.

**Green:** Tests where SCP-2383-J has displayed a green color have resulted in the creation of a form of life. The organisms created by all tests to date have died almost instantly, with the exceptions of SCP-2383-2 and -3. Violent life-forms are to be terminated and the remains disposed of by incineration after testing.

**Purple:** Purple tests have always resulted in the formation of some kind of weapon. Most items produced this way have relatively harmless outward appearance, but 90% are extremely deadly. Of note are SCP-2383-4 and SCP-2383-5. Both exhibit superconductive properties in non-metallic materials, and as [REDACTED]. Retrieval of test results are to be done after sedation of test subject, by armed Agents.

**White:** Only one test subject to date has caused SCP-2383-J to create a white liquid. The result of this test [REDACTED] and classified as SCP-2383-████. How the subject was able to cause [DATA EXPUNGED] currently unknown, as the current particle standard model denies the existence [REDACTED].

**Report SCP-2383-Alpha:** On ██/██/████, D-3412 entered the room directly below the previous storage area for SCP-2383-J. At this time, the spherical nature of the SCP's effect range was unknown, and class D personnel were being utilized to refit the chamber underneath. Upon moving inside the established 5 meter radius at roughly ██:██, D-3412 immediately started demanding the other class D personnel move back, as he was about to [REDACTED]. After other Class D subjects in the chamber retreated approximately 3 metres, SCP-2383-J materialized in the right hand of subject. As the room was bare at the time, D-3412 moved in a straight line towards the adjacent research area at roughly ██km/h.

Cleanup crews were dispatched at ██:██, SCP-2383-J relocated to ground floor containment.
