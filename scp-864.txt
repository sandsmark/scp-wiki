title:Scp 864
**Item Name:** SCP-864

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:**
SCP-864 is not to be filled with water except for experimental purposes. Object must be stored in a 60 cm x 60 cm x 15 cm container, and the container locked. The container must be stored in an air-conditioned room with the humidity turned all the way down. This is to prevent SCP-864's possible escape.

**Description:**
SCP-864 is a washbasin with a 30 cm radius and is 15 cm tall, made from black, resilient plastic commonly found in washbasins of similar design. The object has some lettering on the side, 'Made in China' and 'Black Dragon Co.' being the most distinct. After an extensive research, it is determined that no company of that name is found anywhere in China. SCP-864 shows extensive wear and tear. When object is filled with water until it covers the bottom and any person comes within 5 cm of it, the person will be dragged down into the washbasin by varying appendages. The person will disappear completely and SCP-864 will dry completely.
