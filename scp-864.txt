title:Scp 864
**Item Name:** SCP-864

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:**
SCP-864 is not to be filled with water except for experimental purposes. Object must be stored in a 60 cm x 60 cm x 15 cm container, and the container locked with triple-combination locks. The container must be stored in an air-conditioned room with the humidity turned all the way down. This is to prevent SCP-864's possible escape.

**Description:**
SCP-864 is a washbasin with a 30 cm radius and is 15 cm tall, made from black, resilient plastic commonly found in washbasins of similar design. The object has some lettering on the side, 'Made in China' and 'Black Dragon Co.' being the most distinct. After an extensive research, it is determined that no company of that name is found anywhere in China. SCP-864 shows extensive wear and tear. When object is filled with water until it covers the bottom and any person comes within 5 cm of it, the person will be dragged down into the washbasin by varying appendage(s). If the person fits through the washbasin, the person will disappear completely and SCP-864 will dry up if no interference is applied. However, if the person is too large, the appendage(s) will only reach out for a few seconds, then retreat back to the washbasin, and SCP-864 still retains the water. In some occasions the appendage(s) fail to appear at all.

**Note:** Appendage(s) sighted

- Apr ██, ████. Seven jet-black chepalopod tentacles approximately 90 cm long and about 10 cm in diameter at the base. Managed to drag down a D-class personnel, and went in with the subject. SCP-864 found dry afterwards.

- Jul ██, ████. Three blackish green insectoid claws about 70 cm long. Held down a D-class personnel until supervising guards managed to release the subject. Appendages retreated into the washbasin and still retained water.

- Oct ██, ████. Four pale human arms about 60 cm long. Lurched after an obese D-class personnel, but after a second retreated. Washbasin still retained water.

- Jan ██, ████. Six six-segmented mechanoid arm with cogs and gears visible, about 1 m in length. Managed to drag down a D-class personnel and a guard trying to pry subject loose. Appendages remained still two seconds after the attack, and mechanically folds into SCP-864. Washbasin was found dry afterwards.

- Mar ██, ████. Three tentacles similar to first incident appeared. Tried to grab for a D-class personnel, but one of the tentacles was severed by a guard with a knife. The two other tentacles retreated, and the severed tentacle turned to fine dust. Dust disappeared shortly after. SCP-864 retained the same amount of water as predicted.
