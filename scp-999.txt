**Item #:** SCP-999
 
**Object Class:** Safe
 
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-999 is allowed to freely roam the facility should it desire to, but otherwise must stay in its pot either between 8PM-9PM for watering, or during emergency lockdowns for its own safety. Subject is not allowed out of its pot at night or off fertile grounds at any time. Pot is to be kept freshly soiled and watered weekly. All personnel are allowed inside SCP-999’s greenhouse, but only if they are not assigned to other tasks at the time, or if they are on break. Subject is to be tended to when bored and spoken to in a calm, non-threatening tone.
 
**Description:** SCP-999 appears to be a large variegated nerve plant, weighing about 54 kg (120 lbs) with coloration similar to that of peanut butter. Subject’s size and shape is easily grow-able and can add new leaves at will, though when rooting, SCP-999 becomes may plateau in its growth once it is roughly 2 meters wide and 1 meter in height. The surface of SCP-999 consists of a thin, photosynthetic material composed of plant cells which is roughly .5 cm thick, and is highly elastic, allowing SCP-999 to flatten portions of its body up to 2 cm thin. This surface is also hydrophallic, with SCP-999 being described as "gleeful" in how quickly it can absorb liquids (see Addendum SCP-999-A). The rest of SCP-999's leaves are a vibrant orange color, which should not be eaten no matter how appetizing it may appear.
 
Subject’s temperament is best described as static and plant-like: when approached, SCP-999 will often not react with overwhelming elation, exhibiting no movements such as slithering, leaping, or “hugging” commonly associated with animals. When a face is placed in its bush, there is a pleasant sensation like the skin is being lightly brushed by dozens of firm leaves. The surface of SCP-999 is said to emit a pleasing odor that differs with whomever it is interacting with. It is believed that this is a result of the placebo effect, as SCP-999 is non-flowering and thus cannot emit any odors.
 
Simply viewing SCP-999’s surface causes an immediate mild euphoria, which intensifies the longer one is exposed to SCP-999, and lasts long after separation from the plant. Subject’s least favorite activity is "tickle-wrestling", anyone attempting to wrestle SCP-999 will be politely, but firmly, asked to stop and forcefully removed by Foundation botanists if they do not immediately comply with this request. Despite any bent stems or spilled soil, SCP-999 has never been found to purposefully attempt to harm others, because it is a plant.
 
SCP-999 will interact with anyone, with no special interests in those who are unhappy or hurt in any way. Persons suffering from crippling depression or PTSD, despite this, have reported having a far more positive outlook on life after multiple interactions with SCP-999. The possibility of manufacturing antidepressants from SCP-999's leaves or possibly giving its cuttings to depressed personnel to propagate is currently being discussed.
 
In addition to a lack of playful behavior, SCP-999 is indifferent to all other animals (especially humans). It has been documented as refusing to eat any meat or other non-water foodstuffs. SCP-999 has never been known as one who would risk its own life to save others, although on one occasion it was thrown in front of a person to take a bullet fired at them (subject’s intellect is still up for debate: though its behavior is inanimate, it seemed displeased after its pot was shattered by a bullet and stopped any new growth for six months). SCP-999’s diet consists entirely of water, it should not be given candy and sweets, with M&M’s™ and Necco™ wafers being especially forbidden. Its eating methods are similar to those of an plant.
 
> **Addendum SCP-999-A:** //"Reminder to all staff: SCP-999 is not to be watered with caffeinated soft drinks of any kind. Last week someone gave SCP-999 a can of cola along with its usual water- Not only is that not what you water plants with, the excess liquid caused several slip-and-fall accidents, and those personnel refused to move or work for the rest of the day. SCP-999 has thankfully recovered since, but the staff member in question has been put on an all-water diet."//

**Addendum SCP-999-B:** The following is a report from an experiment in which [[[SCP-682]]] is exposed to SCP-999 in the hopes that it will curb the plant’s omnicidal rage.
 
> SCP-999 is released into SCP-682’s containment area. SCP-999 immediately slithers towards SCP-682.

> SCP-682 and SCP-999 appear to fall asleep. After fifteen minutes with no activity, two D-Class personnel enter the room to retrieve SCP-999. When SCP-999 is removed, SCP-682 immediately wakes up and unleashes no identifiable energy from its leaves, instead continuing to lay on the ground.
>
> Despite the tragedy that SCP-682 had brought upon the facility, SCP-999 has not shown any fear towards the plant but also has made no gestures suggesting it wants to “play” with SCP-682 again. SCP-682, however, has stated, “[DATA EXPUNGED]."
 
//Memo from Dr. ████: “While the test was unsuccessful and ended in tragedy, that had to be the funniest thing I have ever seen. Please send me a copy of the security tapes ASAP.”//
