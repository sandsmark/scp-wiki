**Item #:** SCP-4000

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4000 is to be kept within Storage Locker-23 at Site-13. Testing is to be performed in Testing Chamber 17 under the approval of Level 3 personnel.

**Description:** SCP-4000 is a hardcover children's pop-up book titled "Dr. Wondertainment's Guide to History" with a stylized W at the center of the cover. The back of the cover there is a small pocket holding SCP-4000-1. SCP-4000-1 is a 0.147 meters tall origami depicting an individual with a purple suit, bow tie, and hat along with a cane. On the torso piece, is a small stylized W.

SCP-4000's anomalous properties occur when it is opened within a room. The room in which it is opened will begin to convert to an infinite purple space. An invisible barrier matching the measurements of the room will prevent any exploration and a door will be present to allow exit or entry into the altered environment. As this occurs, SCP-4000-1 will activate by being shrouded in a large puff of smoke instantaneously to become 1.4 meters tall and animate.

SCP-4000-1 is sapient and capable of vocalization in English. It speaks in a mostly enthusiastic tone and identifies itself as "Dr. Papertainment" to personnel. SCP-4000-1 possesses control of the infinite space by altering the surrounding space to appear as historic periods or events and acts as a guide in regards to what is presented. Although, sometimes details mentioned by SCP-4000-1 can be inaccurate, ridiculous, or lack any evidence of ever occurring. Individuals present may make requests to SCP-4000-1 to view a specific time period or it will automatically select one. See Addendum 01 and Addendum 02.

As the environment alters, the pages of SCP-4000 will flip to reveal a page displaying an image corresponding to the forming surroundings. It also unknown how many pages SCP-4000 contains and efforts at determining it has been inconclusive.

SCP-4000 was found on 7/14/2009 at a library located in Lincoln, Nebraska by Foundation agents during an unrelated investigation.

**Addendum 01:** The following transcript was of Dr. Galesburg interacting with SCP-4000-1 within Testing Chamber 12 during earlier testing.

The following is a portion of a transcript with SCP-4000-1 when it was asked to tell the first war in history. The surroundings that formed were silhouettes.

> Long ago, men huddled in caves, afraid of the strange world. When man started, they roamed along side their siblings, whom were [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1788 odd] or [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1000 hairy], and witnessed great beasts and entities they called gods that refused to share the Earth and sky as home. Oh my!
> 
> One day, there came a great war, the first war. Men, along with their siblings, marched on armed with gifts and the aid of sympathetic gods to face an army of great nightmares. Eventually, man and their allies won the war and those that remained of the nightmares fled into the shadows of the world. They celebrated but they still lost many of their siblings. Tragic.
> 
> That's all! I could go into detail but it's so much and not enough time. Besides, it makes it easy for me. Also, you are all technically still fighting the good fight! Anyway, anything else you want to know?

Despite requests, SCP-4000-1 has refused to discuss the subject further.
