**Inactive Projects**

These projects appear to not have been updated in quite a while, whether they've been put on hiatus, suspended, or abandoned.

* [[[SCP Game Project]]] - In particular, the SCP Choose Your Own Adventure Game. **Last Status** - Done recruiting members (//unless you're XNA programmers//), and is currently producing concepts and story lines.
* [[[SCP-TCG]]] - One of two proposed card game projects. **Last Status** - The foundations have been laid, but much more work needs to be done.
* [[[SCP.pdf Project]]] - Transforming all of the current articles into atmospheric .pdfs. **Last Status** - More then half-way done now, only four entry blocks remain.  A periodic update will be needed after this is finished, to take in to account edits, additions and deletions.
* [[[Site 19 Employee Handbook]]] - A mock instruction manual on what the Employee Handbook of Site 19 would look like. **Last Status** - Only one of the beginning sections have been completed, and even then, not all of it. This Project is currently waiting for any persons willing to take out the time and effort to attempt and finish the remaining sections.
