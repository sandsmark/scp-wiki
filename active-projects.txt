These projects appear to not have been updated in quite a while, whether they've been put on hiatus, suspended, or abandoned.

* [[[SCP-TCG]]] - One of two proposed card game projects. **Last Status** - The foundations have been laid, but much more work needs to be done.
* [[[SCP.pdf Project]]] - Transforming all of the current articles into atmospheric .pdfs. **Last Status** - More then half-way done now, only four entry blocks remain.  A periodic update will be needed after this is finished, to take in to account edits, additions and deletions.
