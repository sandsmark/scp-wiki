**Item #:** SCP-1312

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1312 is to be contained behind a perimeter of electrical fencing two (2) meters in height. All potential exits from SCP-1312 are to be kept under guard at all times. Any entities attempting to leave SCP-1312 are to be subdued and taken into containment immediately. No objects or individuals are to enter SCP-1312 without specific authorization.

Any testing of SCP-1312 must be approved by at least three (3) members of Level 3 personnel.

**Description:** SCP-1312 is the designation given to the unfinished Site 41, which experienced an incident seven (7) months into construction in which the entire site relocated three (3) kilometers north. All staff present within SCP-1312 at the time are presumed killed or in such a state that they are to be considered lost. 

SCP-1312 is home to a large amount of humanoid entities[[footnote]]Information regarding these humanoid entities was gleamed through a rover which was placed in SCP-1312-1. The rover recorded the capturing process and subsequent behavior of the entities.[[/footnote]], all of which resemble featureless human beings of solid coloring. These entities show limited intelligence and are docile until they become aware of the presence of an object or organism foreign to SCP-1312. At this point, they will take the object or organism and contain it utilizing the facilities already present in SCP-1312. In cases where the foreign presence is an organism, they will subdue it first by rendering it unable to move or unconscious. These humanoid entities are divided into three separate types:

* **SCP-1312-1:** Humanoid entities of a solid white color. SCP-1312-1 will engage in acts which are assumed to be attempted experimentation with objects or individuals which have been captured. They will typically not approach captured objects themselves, instead directing SCP-1312-3 instances via a series of clicking and groaning noises. SCP-1312-1 also appear to write documentation regarding objects or individuals they have captured. (See Recovered Documents 1312-1.)

* **SCP-1312-2:** Humanoid entities of a solid black color. SCP-1312-2 appear to be in charge of the capture and subduing of foreign objects and individuals. They are capable of speech, but this appears to be limited to the shouting of 'containing breach' when they sight a foreign presence in SCP-1312. 

* **SCP-1312-3:** Humanoid entities of a solid orange color. SCP-1312-3 are directed by SCP-1312-1 in experimentation involving objects foreign to SCP-1312. They will usually follow SCP-1312-1 instances throughout SCP-1312 in large crowds. SCP-1312-3 appear incapable of independent thought and will not act unless prompted by SCP-1312-1.

On ██/██20██, a small expedition was attempted into SCP-1312, the humanoid entities having been distracted by the placement of several objects in SCP-1312 shortly before. During the brief expedition several documents which SCP-1312-1 entities had been observed to write previously were discovered in offices and empty containment chambers. Unfortunately, one member of the expedition was captured by SCP-1312's humanoid entities during the attempted exit. (See Recovered Document 3.)

**Recovered Document 1312-1:**

> **thing number:** scp-1910200?
> 
> **safeness:** really safe
> 
> **containing things to do:** to contain it you need to put it in THE BOX. do not let it out of THE BOX. if it tells you to let it out of THE BOX do not listen to it because it could be trickying you. so far it does not talk but you can never be too careful so keep it in THE BOX. securitymen have to watch THE BOX all the time in case it doesnt escape. it has to be kept in THE BOX forever no matter what unless im using it to write on papers.
> 
> **what it is:** its a thing of wood with a little thing at the end made of black thing. when you put it on a paper it makes  a blackness on the paper too so we are using it as experiments to write this. d-classmen do not get to write this because they are not smart enough. if you hit yourself too hard with it sometimes that hurts but that is just the nature of reality i suppose. 
> 
> when we asked a d-classman to eat it he went on the floor and was dead so we had to take it out of him with sharp things. but you know what they say when a d-classman chokes on the floor on a thing the show has to go on even though. that is a thing i say sometimes
> 
> **other things:** there arent any other things sorry
> 
> //i think you are doing a very good job with this dr. █████.[[footnote]]On the original document, this was originally a large scribble.[[/footnote]] you are a master of the scp things.// - Oh 51[[footnote]]Note that the same entity wrote both the document and the addendum from 'Oh 51.'[[/footnote]]

**Recovered Document 1312-2:**

> **thing number:** scp-0293019201992
> 
> **safeness:** could be unsafe maybe?
> 
> **containing things that you need to do:** dont touch it because it could be a bad thing to do that. dont drink it unless i tell you to drink it because I AM THE BOSS AROUND HERE OK. if i tell you to drink it then you have to drink it though. d-classmen are the only ones to drink it unless i say they arent. securitymen keep their eyes on the thing unless it tries to do a thing. if it doesnt dont get worried though because it could be nice.
> 
> **what it is:** its a white thing with a thing on the side of the thing for holding the thing. theres stuff in it that you can drink but you cant drink it unless i say so. d-classmen say the thing is nice to drink but i didnt trust them so i got dr. doctor to drink it and he thought it was nice too and i trust his opinion because he is my friend and sometimes we nod at each other in the hallway well i nod at him but i know he notices so thats nice. 
> 
> when we first got the drinking thing in the thing it was warm but now it isnt but that might be because of the rooms coldness making the drinking thing sad and making it cold too. i dont know i am not a rocket scientist i am an scp scientist. dr. barmabies says that he used to drink the thing and that he remembers other things but he is A LIAR A LIAR A LIAR A LIAR A LIAR A LIAR (This continues for several pages.)
> 
> but its cold now so maybe we dont have to worry about it but we should still be careful because of our motto people. we have a duty to secure the contain and protect. 

**Recovered Document 1312-3:**

> **item number:** scp-THEMOSTDANGEROUSTHING
> 
> **safeness:** --THE MOST DANGEROUS THING-- actually nevermind we broke it
> 
> **containing things to do:** securitymen have to stop the thing from getting out of the room its in. we tried feeding it d-classmen but it doesnt eat so maybe its not hungry. i dont know but keep trying to feed it d-classmen just in case. make dr barmabies stop talking about things because HE IS A LIAR WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH THIS AND HE IS A LIAR i am going to make securitymen get him if he keeps telling his lies. securitymen dont listen to what the thing tells you. sometimes the thing will say hurtful things but i trust you and know you can deal with it. if it tries to get out hit it and put it back in
> 
> **what it is:** it is like a man but pink and with stuff on it like a thing with things on it. i dont know how to say what it is because it is weird and not right. he says he is an scpman like us but i do not trust him because he is scp-THEMOSTDANGEROUSTHING. we dont have agentmen anyway so thats proof of a liar right there. sometimes i try to tell the thing that lying is wrong but he just says hurtful things to me and makes me feel sad about myself and my achievements but i know that im the best doctorman in site 41. i have papers from Oh 51 that tells me it come to my office if you dont believe me and i will show them to you.
> 
> it has a thing with hurting things in it that we took off it. when we pointed it a d-classman and pulled the pulling bit the d-classman died because there was a thing in his head. we did more tests and now it doesnt work so i think we broke it. we asked the thing how to fix it but he just said more hurtful things.
> 
> it had a thing with it as well where you pressed the button and the voices said hello agent banks are you there and we said hello are you the scp and it said its an insistence of scp13121 and im glad there are other people who know about the dangers of scps but I AM THE TOP DOG AROUND HERE AND NO TALKING SCP THING IS BETTER THAN ME AT BEING A DOCTORMAN and i said that and they stopped talking to me so i think we broke that too.
> 
> **experimenting that we did:** we used sharp things to check what was inside the thing because we thought there might be more scps there. there were some red things and the thing was making noises and we told it to be quiet because we were doing important experiments but it didnt for a bit then it did stop. we found a red thing that was moving a little when we found it but when we pulled it out it stopped moving. we took out the white things from the things head and saw if it killed a d-classman when we threw it at him but it didnt and made a mess on him instead. the thing doesnt move or talk or do anything anymore so i think we broke it too.
