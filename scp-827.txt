**Item #:** SCP-827

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** A week-long quarantine, both before and after assignment, is required for work on SCP-827. Researchers assigned to SCP-827 are not allowed to leave the designated areas of the campus where SCP-827 is being kept. Due to these stringent requirements, it is suggested that staff be frequently (twice-yearly, depending on human resource availability) rotated to keep morale high.

Research on SCP-827 must be conducted in a setting involving protocols suitable for Biohazard Level 2 or higher.

The majority of SCP-827 cells are contained in the SOUP BOWL. The SOUP BOWL is the code name for the dedicated cell reactor that extracts waste from and provides nutrition to the cell broth. When organ consumption/generation is not taking place, the SOUP BOWL agitates the broth to keep cell density constant. Twice-daily maintenance checks must be conducted on the SOUP BOWL system to ensure integrity and to maintain the precise environment needed for SCP-827.

Due to the results of experiment 827-██, experiments involving nerve material from the central nervous system are no longer allowed. Please take all precautions to ensure that central nervous tissue are not present in organs treated for placement in the SOUP BOWL.

**Description:** SCP-827 is a mass of biologically active human stem cells, capable of self-renewal and totipotency. The cells are, when not active, completely undifferentiated. Prepared human organs placed in SCP-827 are digested in a manner of hours. Over the next few days, the previously undifferentiated cells begin generation of copies of these organs. A few weeks after the consumption of the initial organ the SCP-827 reset themselves. Any tissue or organs remaining in SCP-827 return to an undifferentiated state. 

The organ copies are occasionally plagued by errors in the assimilation and/or construction process, leading to generation of anomalies that are not suitable for human organ transplantation. The likelihood of an anomaly is increased when incomplete organs are consumed.

Organs grown from SCP-827 and removed before the reset remain intact, and have heretofore been transplanted with no obvious harm to the recipients. However, the Overseers wish to be sure that, while the organs may appear to be human-transplantable, there is no risk that unseen errors in the growth process will harm the host. 

Due to cells lost to creating organs, testing will be spaced so 827 may replenish its cell count.

**Addenda:**
**827a:** //A warning to new researchers -- when we talk so dispassionately about "anomalies" we're referring to things like the "broken-tooth tree". We put part of a jaw in the Soup, hoping we'd get something we could use in a reconstructive surgery experiment, and the Soup grew this central trunk of thick muscle tissue. We think that the muscle tissue was based on the tongue. From this central trunk partially constructed jaws grew. Rhythmic muscle moves would cause the jaws to open and snap shut. They did this over and over and over. By the time the Soup reset itself, the teeth were shattered, and we were clearing tooth pieces from the soup bowl filter on an hourly basis.//

//So, yeah, keep that in mind that's what an "anomaly" is.// -Dr. ████████

**827b:** Researchers have requested use of samples of [[[SCP-253]]] to test similarity in cell potency and replication mechanisms, and to test under what conditions 827 may become cancerous or virulent. Request denied by O5-██: SCP-253 is Euclid.

**827c:** Researchers have requested use of samples of the remains of [[[SCP-541]]]. Initial experimentation to investigate 827's interaction with  541's unique metabolism. Request denied by O5-██: SCP-541 has no useful qualities to replicate for normal human consumption.

**827d:** //The Overseers have asked me to remind researchers that our focus with 827 is generating a patentable commercial technology. We need to establish safe procedures for the production and commercial use of this stuff, and using other SCPs would make those procedures restricted to the Foundation. It may seem like mercenary greed overwhelming scientific curiosity, but consider this: It seems likely that whoever made this in the first place will make more. Their product will be desperately sought, and desperately flawed.//

//The Foundation dearly wants to corner and tame this particular part of the biotechnology market. We must be what sets the pace of human modification and supplementation over the next century.//

//The Overseers want us to get a superior, safe version of 827 in the public consciousness, before whoever made this tries again.// 

//Please tailor future research proposals to this end.// -Dr. ███
