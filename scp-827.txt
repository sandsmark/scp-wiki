**Item #:** SCP-827

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** A week-long quarantine, both before and after assignment, is required for work on SCP-827. Researchers assigned to SCP-827 are not allowed to leave the designated areas of the campus where SCP-827 is being kept. Due to these stringent requirements, it is suggested that staff be frequently (twice-yearly, depending on human resource availability) rotated to keep morale high.

Research on SCP-827 must be conducted in a setting involving protocols suitable for Biohazard Level 2 or higher.

Twice-daily maintenance checks must be conducted on the SOUP BOWL system to ensure integrity and to maintain the precise environment needed for SCP-827.

Due to the results of experiment 827-██, experiments involving nerve material from the central nervous system are no longer allowed. Please take all precautions to ensure that cental nervous tissue are not present in organs treated for placement in the SOUP BOWL.

**Description:** SCP-827 is a mass of biologically active cells. Genetic analysis, as well as analyses of the cell structure itself, indicates that these cells are human stem cells. These stem cells have both the properties of self-renewal and totipotency. The cells are, when not active, completely undifferentiated.

Currently, the majority of SCP-827 cells are contained in the SOUP BOWL. The SOUP BOWL is the code name for the dedicated cell incubator that is able to extract waste from and provide nutrition to the cell broth. When organ consumption/generation is not taking place, the SOUP BOWL is designed to keep the broth agitated to keep cell density constant.

When appropriately prepared human organs are placed in SCP-827, they are digested in a manner of hours. Over the next few days, the previously undifferentiated cells begin a complex process that results in the generation of copies of the organs consumed by the broth.

However, these copies are occasionally plagued by errors in the assimilation and/or construction process, leading to generation of anomalies that are not suitable for human organ transplantation.

//A warning to new researchers — when we talk about anomalies we're referring to things like the "broken-tooth tree". We put part of a jaw in the Soup, hoping we'd get something we could use in a reconstructive surgery experiment, and the Soup grew this central trunk of thick muscle tissue. We think that the muscle tissue was based on the tongue. From this central trunk partially constructed jaws grew. Rhythmic muscle moves would cause the jaws to open and snap shut. They did this over and over and over. By the time the Soup reset itself, the teeth were shattered, and we were clearing tooth pieces from the soup bowl filter on an hourly basis.//

//So, yeah, keep that in mind that's what an "anomaly" is.// -Dr. ████████

-----

A few weeks after SCP-827 begins the consumption phase of its behavior, the cells reset themselves. They consume any remaining tissue and organs left inside the SOUP BOWL and return to an undifferentiated state.

Organs grown from SCP-827 and removed before the return to undifferentiation remain intact, and have been placed with no harm within recipients. However, the Overseers wish to be sure that there is no risk that while an organ may appear human transplantable unseen errors in the growth process introduce the potential for harm to the host.

**Addenda:**
__827a:__ Researchers have requested use of samples of [[[SCP-253]]] for experimentation with SCP-827. Request denied by O5-██.

__827b:__ Researchers have request use of samples of the optimized organism produced by [[[SCP-427]]] for experimentation with SCP-827. Request denied by O5-██.

__827c:__ Researchers have requested use of samples of the remains of [[[SCP-541]]]. Request denied by O5-██.

__827d:__ Researchers have requested use of samples of [[[SCP-347]]] for experimentation with SCP-827. Request denied by O5-██.

//The Overseers have asked me to remind researchers that our focus with this SCP is generating a patentable commercial technology. We need to get this to market. Please tailor your research proposals for such a goal.// -Dr. ███

__827e:__ [[[SCP-542]]] has requested use of SCP-827. Request was quickly denied by O5-██. An inquiry into how 542 obtained knowledge of this SCP is ongoing.

//Trust me, whoever let THAT particular SCP know about SCP-827 is going on immediate Keter duty.// -O5██

__827f:__ Researchers have requested use of samples of [[[SCP-682]]] for experimentation with SCP-827. Request strongly denied by O5-██.

//That's the final straw. Hence forth any submitted research proposal must have as a goal the investigation of the safety and immediate commercialization of this technology. Any proposal not of major strategic importance (i.e. neutralization of Keter-class objects) for use of SCP-class resources will be denied, and the submitter will be assigned to Keter duty.// -O5-██

__827g:__ On ██/██/20██ Researcher ████ placed [[[SCP-963]]] within a prepared vat of 827. 

Researcher ███ was reassigned to D-class duty for [[[SCP-527]]].

//I only wish I could've stuck ████ in the broth instead of Bright. I especially like the part where he tried to form a mouth to scream. I think I'm going to force my researchers to watch this for a few days to curtail this experimentation in the future.// -O5-██

The sample of 827 was placed under observation and designated 827-1. After three (3) days 963 was retrieved. Though presumably Bright's consciousness was no longer present in sample of 827, it continued to develop. To date, this sample of 827 has yet to return to a state of undifferentiation, and continues to develop disorganized structures in the manner of a teratoma.

O5-██ has expressly forbid destruction of 827-1, and two (2) hours of observation of the sample is required to submit any research proposal to the Overseers.
