**Item #:** SCP-3143

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Attempts to contain SCP-3143 are ongoing. A Foundation-operated bot (I/O-ISMETA) is to monitor online fiction communities for signs of its emergence. When found, an authorized member of the [[[operation-overmeta|Pataphysics Department]]] is to be assigned to deconstruct it. 

MTF Iota-10 ("Damn Freds") is to investigate any leads regarding possible locations of SCP-3143-A. If found, he is to be apprehended and taken into Foundation custody.

**Description:** SCP-3143 is an intrafictional construct. When active, this construct exhibits the ability to temporarily 'flatten' portions of reality into a script-like narrative. This narrative is derivative of the genre established by North American writers of hard-boiled and noir fiction[[footnote]]Notable examples include Dashiell Hammett's //[[[red-harvest|Red Harvest]]]// (1929) and Raymond Chandler's //[[[the-long-goodbye|The Long Goodbye]]]// (1953).[[/footnote]].

During this period, SCP-3143 takes on the role of the main character (a 1930s private detective) hired to solve a case. All entities flattened by its effect become characters within the narrative surrounding it, exhibiting personalities and attributes typical of the genre's style. The narrative will continue until SCP-3143's actions lead to a resolution consistent with the genre; at this point, the narrative will conclude and reality will revert. Events which occurred within the narrative will be projected into reality; however, entities involved in these events will typically have no recollection of what occurred. 

SCP-3143 was first noted in 2005 in the [[[scp-3043|aftermath]]] of a containment breach at Site-95. In 2012, the Foundation's Pataphysics Department worked alongside the [[[to-be-noir-not-to-be|Department of Analytics]]] to make contact with and apprehend SCP-3143.

SCP-3143-A is Murphy Lawden, SCP-3143's author.

> ----
> **DATE:** 2012/02/02
> **INTERVIEWER:** Dr. Thaum
> **SUBJECT:** SCP-3143, SCP-3143-A
> **NOTE:** Dr. Thaddeus Thaum is part of the Pataphysics Department. He has a degree in English Literature, and specializes in the analysis of fiction.
> ----
> {{FADE IN:}}
> 
> {{INT. MURPHY LAW DETECTIVE AGENCY - NIGHT}}
> 
> {{A light-skinned man sits alone in his office; a blade of moonlight cuts across his face. His trademark trilby hat is tossed thoughtlessly across his desk; a bent cigarette is nearby, left smoldering in an ashtray. His shirt is stained with blood -- some of it might even be his own.}}
> 
> {{He's got a slug of bourbon in his hand, a slug of lead buried in his chest, and 6 more waiting for the next son of a bitch who comes through that door -- courtesy of his .44.}}
> 
> {{His name is MURPHY LAW, and if you think his number is up, then you haven't been counting. He's the sort of man you pray for when you need him -- and the sort you curse when you don't.}}
> 
> {{He is also our NARRATOR. His voice is a husky snarl; as if he's got a throat stuffed full of sand-paper and rusty nails.}}
> 
> = {{**NARRATOR**}}
>> {{If there's one thing the Foundation is good at, it's tying up loose ends. I knew it was just a matter of time before the lab-coats tried to shove me in a box.}}
> 
> {{The door to the office flies open. An old man in a lab-coat enters; he's got a scowl so deep it's been carved down into the bone. This is DR. THAUM, and he's here to get to the bottom of this -- no matter what the cost.}}
> 
> = {{**NARRATOR**}}
>> {{But if they wanted to contain //me//, they were gonna need a bigger box.}}

> 
> = {{**NARRATOR**}}
>> {{He wanted answers. I just wanted out.}}
> 
> {{MURPHY finishes the shot of bourbon and levels his pistol at DR. THAUM's chest.}}
>

>> {{Give me one good reason why I shouldn't ventilate you right now, doc.}}
> 
> {{DR. THAUM raises an eyebrow, folding his arms across his chest.}}
> 
> = {{**DR. THAUM**}}
>> {{Because you can't.}}
> 
> = {{**NARRATOR**}}
>> {{If he thought I didn't have the moxie to plug him full of lead, then he had another thing coming. Specifically, a whole lot of lead.}}
> 
> = {{**DR. THAUM**}}
>> {{You //do// know that I can hear you narrating, right?}}
> 
> = {{**NARRATOR**}}
>> {{What the hell was he on about? Something wasn't right.}}
> 
> = {{**DR. THAUM**}}
>> {{You're an infrafictional construct; a sapient story that can warp reality. Specifically, you flatten it into a movie script that mimics crime-fiction and hard-boiled noir.}}
> 
> {{**NARRATOR**}}
>> {{This wasn't... what?}}
> 
> {{**DR. THAUM**}}
>> {{And let's be honest -- it's not even proper noir. The defining element of the style is the anti-hero; the character with no prospects, trapped in a world with no future. But after reviewing your file, I can see that you don't qualify.}}
> 
> {{**MURPHY**}}
>> {{I don't... qualify...?}}
> 
> {{**DR. THAUM**}}
>> {{Your narrative is heroic and simple, with clear villains and heroes. In the end, the day is saved without consequence. That's not hard-boiled -- it's certainly not noir. You're just fantasy escapism dressed up in a suit, a hat, and a drinking habit.}}
> 
> {{**MURPHY:** Where -- where are we? What's happening?}}
> 
> {{**DR. THAUM:** You rely on the //tropes// of noir -- outwardly rejecting the notion of appearances and style while secretly embracing them -- engaging in a hyper-masculine narrative based around the myth of the frontier, only projected in an urban environment...}}
> 
> {{**MURPHY:** What is this?}}
> 
> {{**DR. THAUM:** ...but you fail to faithfully replicate their complex, dense settings where moral action is all but impossible. You fail to connect to the essence of what makes noir what it is. You are, in a sense, merely parodying it. An unintentional satire, if you will.}}
> 
> {{**SCP-3143:** What's going on?!}}
> 
> {{**DR. THAUM:** And on top of it all, your name is based on an absurdly contrived pun.}}
> 
> {{**SCP-3143:** What are you doing?!}}
> 
> {{**DR. THAUM:** I'm deconstructing you, SCP-3143. I'm //containing// you.}}
> 
> {{**SCP-3143:** I... I don't understand...}}
> 
> {{**DR. THAUM:** I'd like to speak with the author, please. Mr. Lawden? Are you there?}}
> 
> **SCP-3143-A:** How...?
> 
> **DR. THAUM:** Hello, SCP-3143-A.
> 
> **SCP-3143-A:** Where am I? Who am I?
> 
> **DR. THAUM:** You are Murphy Lawden, a retired shoe-salesman from New Jersey. You live alone -- save for your two cats.
> 
> **SCP-3143-A:** I'm...? Oh, God. How did I get here?
> 
> **DR. THAUM:** We believe you accidentally created an intrafictional construct. Do you recall a screen-play of yours? //It Always Rains//? 
> 
> **SCP-3143-A:** I... I think so. I don't -- oh, God. 
> 
> **DR. THAUM:** I think we've done enough for today, Mr. Lawden. I'll give you a chance to rest and settle in; we can continue this interview later, if that's alright with you?
> 
> **SCP-3143-A:** I... yeah. Uh, yeah. Okay. Okay. I need to gather my thoughts.
> 
> **DR. THAUM:** Of course.

> 
> **DR. THAUM:** Something like that, yes. We found an unfinished copy of your script, //It Always Rains//. That's how we determined who you were.
> 
> **SUBJECT:** God, I remember that. It was... yeah. I wanted to write, um, write a story, or something, I think? Something like what I read as a little kid? 
> 
> **DR. THAUM:** Somehow, you managed to bring the narrative to life -- literally. You 'became' the main character, in a sense.

> My thoughts:
> 
> It might not have worked, but this was nevertheless an excellent test-run for 'Dr. Thaum' and the 'Pataphysics Department'. I recommend we keep them on the books -- they might come in handy, particularly in regards to developing allegorical and metafictional countermeasures. Besides, it's not like a fictitious department with fictitious employees has a costly upkeep.
> 
> Otherwise, leave the article as is. It might contain several inconsistencies (the fact that neither Murphy Lawden nor //It Always Rains// actually exist being the most glaring) but further edits could invite unwanted attention from SCP-3143.
> 
> On that note: Let's leave SCP-3143 alone for a while. Yes, we've learned quite a bit about him, but he's also learned quite a bit about us. Until we know precisely how his abilities work, further efforts to contain him could be dangerous. I'm particularly concerned with what he said during the final interview -- it sounds like he thinks we're all just as fictitious as he is.
> 
> On a final note: [[[SCP-423]]] is currently missing. I'm concerned it might have something to do with our little experiment. I'm having some of my people look into it; I'll keep you updated.
