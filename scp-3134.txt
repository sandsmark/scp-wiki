**Item #:** SCP-3134

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** As removing SCP-3134 from its current habitat is impractical at this time, containment is instead to focus on keeping it from exiting Zone 29-Job. Containment teams in the area are to maintain their assigned front ('Department of Mine Clearance'), while patrolling said Zone regularly to maintain SCP-3134's containment. Zone 29-Job is currently defined as region near Verdun, France, publicly referred to as 'Zone Rouge'; an area environmentally devastated by combat during World War I.

As tourist activity was present in Zone 29-Job before the existence of SCP-3134 came to light, it is currently not feasible to remove civilian presence from the area. Instead, tourist presence in Zone 29-Job is to be influenced away from areas in the Zone frequented by SCP-3134. Any civilians who do report sightings of SCP-3134 are to be dosed with Class-A amnestics by on-site plainclothes personnel immediately.

Local spiritual clean-up organizations (See Addendum 3134-1) are to be monitored for any activity or communications regarding SCP-3134, and any suspected action on their part is to be neutralized at the first opportunity.

Food appropriate for SCP-3134, as dictated by Nutritional Chart 3134-1, is to be placed periodically within the center of Zone 29-Job in order to influence its movements. Planning and construction for permanent containment of SCP-3134 in an on-site facility is ongoing, and expected to be complete soon.

**Description:** SCP-3134 is a large mammalian creature of black colouration, weighing 460kg with a standing height of 2m and a length of 2.6m. It appears to have suffered severe injuries in the past, including lacerations, burns and severe bruising throughout its body. SCP-3134 possesses features from a wide number of species, including multiple horns and antlers on its head, growths throughout its body resembling human facial features, and overall morphology similar to that of a bear. Despite these features, DNA analysis has revealed that SCP-3134 is genetically identical to a common rabbit.

Current evidence suggests that SCP-3134 can only survive within the bounds of Zone 29-Job. When removed from Zone 29-Job, SCP-3134 exhibits symptoms consistent with respiratory difficulties, followed by severe seizures and existing burns spreading over its body. These symptoms reverse themselves upon SCP-3134's return to Zone 29-Job. While it is unknown whether these symptoms would result in SCP-3134's death, it has been determined that testing of that nature presents an unacceptable level of risk to further SCP-3134 study.

Observation by on-site personnel has revealed that SCP-3134's diet consists mainly of unexploded shells, grenades and human remains. Although the first of these invariably explode during consumption by SCP-3134, it will quickly regenerate from such injuries.[[footnote]] Curiously enough, SCP-3134 does not display these regenerative abilities after undergoing any other type of injury. [[/footnote]] While SCP-3134 will not actively seek out humans, it does display severe hostility when it encounters them, often attempting to maul or otherwise attack them. SCP-3134 appears to prefer resting in trenches left from battles within Zone 29-Job.

Despite its animalistic behaviour and aggression, SCP-3134 has been known to display signs of intelligence, primarily through the forms of emotional response to presented media. (See Interview 3134-1)

**Interview 3134-1:** 

On 12/08/2010, analysis of SCP-3134's living area while it was away feeding revealed what appeared to be a collection of photographs, arranged in a loose pile, believed to have been originally left behind by soldiers serving in the area which became Zone 29-Job. As SCP-3134 had not demonstrated such behaviour with any other items in Zone 29-Job[[footnote]] Including modern photographs dropped by tourists in the area. [[/footnote]], this was taken as possible evidence that SCP-3134 had higher levels of intelligence than originally believed, as well as a possible connection to the history of Zone 29-Job.

As a test of SCP-3134's intellectual capacity and the nature of its connection to Zone 29-Job, approval was given for an experimental interview to be conducted by the Abnormal Interrogations Department. Through the efforts of MTF-Psi-2 ("The Answer"), SCP-3134 was temporarily restrained in a manner suited for interview[[footnote]] Secured to the ground via bindings around its torso, allowing it only limited movement. [[/footnote]] forest within Zone 29-Job. Interview was conducted via SCP-3134 being presented with several enlarged photographs by Dr McCall to test for emotional response. Although most presented photographs yielded no clear results, the following stimuli resulted in abnormal responses:

||~ Stimuli ||~ Response ||
|| Photograph of one of the individuals who attempted to enter Zone 29-Job to neutralize SCP-3134. (See Addendum 3134-1) || Aggression response. SCP-3134 attempted to attack photograph. ||
|| Photograph of a field in the French countryside. || Curiosity response. SCP-3134 attempted to sniff and further inspect photograph. ||
|| Photograph of a World War I-era combat boot. || Fear response. SCP-3134 turned away from the photograph and cowered. ||
|| Photograph of a field in the British countryside. || Confusion response. SCP-3134 ignored the photograph after several seconds of inspection. ||
|| Photograph of a German soldier deployed to the area that became Zone 29-Job. || Aggression response. SCP-3134 attempted to attack photograph. ||
|| Photograph of Georges Clemenceau, Prime Minister of France during World War I. || Unknown response. SCP-3134 attempted to adopt a bipedal stance for several minutes before resuming normal behaviour. ||
|| Photograph of an officer in the French army deployed to the area that became Zone 29-Job. || Aggression response. SCP-3134 attempted to attack photograph. ||
|| Photograph of a World War I-era rifle. || Unknown response. SCP-3134 attempted to take photograph from Dr McCall using front paws, looked at it for several minutes further when provided, then dropped it to the ground and resumed normal behaviour. ||
|| Photograph of a French soldier deployed to the area that became Zone 29-Job. || Sadness response. SCP-3134 lay down and whimpered until the photograph was removed.[[footnote]] SCP-3134 gave an identical response to photographs of other soldiers who had been deployed to the area. [[/footnote]]  ||

Shortly after the final photograph was presented, SCP-3134 broke through its restraints and escaped into the surrounding forests. Construction of a covert installation in Zone 29-Job dedicated to containing SCP-3134 was approved after this point.

**Addendum 3134-1:** On ██/██/20██, several professional exorcists associated with the PWSSR[[footnote]] The Post-War Society for Spiritual Restoration, one of several societies formed after World War I to restore areas of France spiritually affected, through exorcism and other thaumaturgical means. [[/footnote]] attempted to infiltrate Foundation-controlled areas of Zone 29-Job in a presumed effort to neutralize SCP-3134. These individuals were intercepted, dosed with Class-B amnestics and released.[[footnote]] Although normal policy would dictate a more severe response, this measure was taken so as to not initiate hostilities with the PWSSR, an organization with primarily good relations with the Foundation. [[/footnote]] Investigation is ongoing regarding how this group gained knowledge of SCP-3134.

Several items of interest were retrieved from these individuals while in custody, including several coded crystal matrixes[[footnote]] A method of data-storage popular among thaumaturgical organizations in which information is stored in a crystalline form, usually worn as a necklace or ring. [[/footnote]], large amounts of holy water and refined chalk, as well as a copy of A.A. Gilford's //Guide to Feral Exorcism: Eviscerating Malevolent Spirits from Animals//[[footnote]] Copies of this text are currently available in the Foundation's Thaumaturgical Database.
