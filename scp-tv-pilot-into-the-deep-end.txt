                                   VOICEOVER
                         We will bring them forth, with
                         blood and pestilence. It cannot be
                         stopped. It is only a matter of
                         time.

               EXT. BIG RIG ON A US HIGHWAY

               ANGLE ON big rig heading down a US highway at dawn. We hear a
               tinny radio version of "Fast Freight" by The Kingston Trio as
               the truck approaches.

                                                                CUT TO:

               INT. CAB OF BIG RIG

               CLOSE SHOT on cab radio, the source of the music, then ANGLE
               ON DRIVER listening to music. (S)he seems to notice something
               in the distance, and as we cut, the music becomes higher
               fidelity.

[[>]]
                                                                CUT TO:
[[/>]]



               EXT. POV FROM CAB

               We see a sign for a weigh station, whose light switches from
               "Closed" to "Open." Below the main sign is another reading:
               "Mile sponsored by: Society for Cetacean Protection".

                                                                CUT TO:

               INT. CAB OF BIG RIG

               Driver seems noticeably perturbed. (S)he starts to turn the
               truck into the weigh station, as we...

                                                                CUT TO:
[[/>]]



               EXT. WEIGH STATION

               WIDE SHOT of truck pulling in as an ATTENDANT waves the truck
               into a lane near a series of bays.
               As the truck comes to a stop, this should be timed with the
               end of the final musical phrase "If you go, you can't come
               back," around 1:15. Music ends here (background music may
               commence).

               WIDE SHOT of Attendant near cab driver door. Door opens, then
               ANGLE ON each speaker in turn. Driver does not leave cab. 

[[=]]
                                   DRIVER
                         What the hell?

                                   ATTENDANT
                         New state regs. Random survey crap.
                         15 minutes, 20 tops. Over here.
[[/=]]

               WIDE SHOT as Attendant points towards one of the bays. Driver
               closes door and maneuvers the big rig into the bay, which
               Attendant accompanies and SHOT FOLLOWS. CLOSE IN again on
               door as it opens, driver exits cab, ANGLE ON each speaker in
               turn.

[[=]]
                                   DRIVER
                         Anywhere to get a cup of coffee at
                         least? Long way to Fall River.

                                   ATTENDANT
                         (takes notice, then smiling) Sure,
                         I can put on a fresh pot. This way.
[[/=]]

               WIDE SHOT as the two exit the bay heading towards the weigh
               station office, though shot remains centered on the bay.
               CLOSE IN on Attendant's hand pushing a button on a device on
               his/er belt. WIDE SHOT as they leave the shot, we see both
               the bay door start to close, but also the truck seems to
               start descending into the bay floor.

                                                                CUT TO:

               INT. TRUCK IN BAY

               OVERHEAD SHOT of truck descending down some large shaft.

[[>]]
                                                                CUT TO:
[[/>]]



               INT. SITE-76 LOADING BAY

               WIDE SHOT on a large industrial loading bay, as the truck
               descends onto a loading pad. We see numerous personnel in
               various states of work. As the truck reaches the bottom,
               several GUARDS in hardshell carapace armor, armed with
               automatic rifles, converge towards the back of the trailer.

               CLOSE IN on the rear trailer door, as it springs open. We see
               a troop transport exit, rolling down a waiting ramp. SHOT
               FOLLOWS the transport as it maneuvers into a parking space,
               Guards following.

               ANGLE IN on transport door, surrounded by Guards. Door opens,
               and we see a succession of D-CLASS and Guards, alternating,
               exiting the transport. The D-Class (Foundation test subjects)
               are garbed in orange jumpsuits and have a black bag
               completely enveloping their heads. Their hands are manacled
               behind their backs, and legs are also manacled but allow
               walking. One of the D-Class has black gloves covering their
               hands and wrists (GLOVED D-CLASS). The accompanying Guards
               are similarly equipped as their Site-76 counterparts. SHOT
               WIDENS as the Guards group the D-Class into rows. There are
               12 D-Class in all, each with a Guard on their right.

               During this scene, the transport goes back to the truck and
               re-enters the cab. The cab rear door closes, and the truck
               ascends back up the shaft. This is all subordinate to the
               main action, happening in the background, but it is meant to
               suggest a fast transfer, triggered by the Attendant above.

               Another group of 12 Guards joins the D-Class group, each
               Guard moving to the left of each D-Class. This group now
               moves forward, and each pair of Guards will ferry their D
               Class to a variety of holding cells, shown in a series of
               CUTS (groups splitting up at corridor junctions, marching
               down corridors, ferrying D-Class into cells). While this is
               happening, we hear the following over a site-wide intercom:

[[=]]
                                   INTERCOM
                         Alert. (CUT) Site-76 D-Class
                         loading protocol is in effect.
                         (CUT) Condition Yellow. (CUT) All
                         Foundation personnel not involved
                         in the loading protocol (CUT) are
                         asked to clear corridors until the
                         All Clear is sound. (CUT) Alert
                         (repeats as needed)
[[/=]]



               INT. OUTSIDE SITE-76 "CELL" DOOR

               At the final CUT, the two Guards ferrying the Gloved D-Class
               (OUTSIDE/INSIDE, corresponding to from bus/from Site-76) stop
               in front of an apparent cell door. CLOSE IN on Inside Guard
               applying key card to door mechanism, which clicks open. 

[[>]]
                                                                CUT TO:
[[/>]]



               INT. SITE-76 DECOMMISSIONED LAB

               ANGLE IN on inside of door as the Inside Guard, Gloved D
               Class, and Outside Guard enter in that order. Inside Guard
               continues in, but Outside Guard stops short with D-Class and
               expresses surprise.

               REVERSE ANGLE on Inside Guard, as we see what looks like a
               derelict lab (not a holding cell, in any case). He approaches
               a lab bench. Outside Guard begins speaking in this view, then
               immediately CUT BACK to ANGLE ON Outside Guard and Gloved D
               Class.

[[=]]
                                   OUTSIDE GUARD
                         Hey, what's this? (CUT) Are you
                         sure this is the right-
[[/=]]

               But Outside Guard is cut short by Gloved D-Class (still
               hooded), who swings its arms completely over its head as
               though on a 360 degree ball joint, encircling Outside Guard's
               head and putting him/her into a chokehold with the manacles.
               CLOSE IN as Outside Guard struggles and begins to lose
               consciousness.

               CUT BACK to Inside Guard, who places a small metal disk on
               the lab bench, as we hear (but do not see) the Outside
               Guard's body collapse and hit the floor. CLOSE IN on disk as
               Inside Guard touches the top, which causes the disk to glow
               deep blue and infusing the room with the dim hue.

               PROFILE SHOT as Inside Guard walks back to Gloved D-Class.
               Inside Guard bends over to undo the Gloved D-Class' leg
               manacles and speaks in a hushed tone.

[[=]]
                                   INSIDE GUARD
                         The jammer shut's off in 60
                         seconds, but that's all we'll need.
[[/=]]

               CLOSE IN on Gloved D-Class' hands. While Inside Guard keeps
               talking, Gloved D-Class squirms out of its arm manacles in an
               anomalous fashion, tossing them aside.

[[=]]
                                   INSIDE GUARD (CONT'D)
                         I've logged you into your cell, so
                         you won't be missed right away.
[[/=]]

               WIDEN SHOT back to PROFILE. Inside Guard hands Gloved D-Class
               a key card.

[[=]]
                                   INSIDE GUARD (CONT'D)
                         This gets you into the Keter Wing
                         and the containment cell.
                         (more slowly) Once you breach,
                         you'll have a minute at most.
                         (faster) That's it, I have to-
[[/=]]

               Gloved D-Class suddenly grabs Inside Guard's head and snaps
               his/her neck instantly, letting him/her fall to the ground.

               WIDE ANGLED SHOT of Gloved D-Class with dead bodies on either
               side of it. ANGLE IN on Gloved D-Class so that torso and
               hands are in view, then slowly PAN DOWN to hands as it
               removes and drops gloves. Hands are anomalous humanoid hands
               and are covered in tattoos. PAN UP as hands reach to remove
               head bag. As the bag comes off, we CUT TO BLACK, then...



               INT. CORRIDOR TO KETER WING TWO

               BLACK DISSOLVES as a figure walks into corridor from front of
               camera (i.e. uncovering the camera lens). We gradually see
               the back of a Guard (the Gloved D-Class in stolen armor)
               approaching a corridor arch guarded by two GUARDS. REVERSE
               ANGLE to show approaching Gloved D-Class in full Foundation
               armor, wearing sunglasses and a very blank expression. It
               holds the key card in its (Foundation gloved) hand, and
               continues walking forward.

               CLOSE IN on wall panel showing a blue Foundation trefoil.
               Hand with card moves into frame and touches panel turning the
               trefoil green and sounding an acknowledgement chime. PAN UP
               to the back of the Gloved D-Class, who continues walking
               through the arch. SHOT WIDENS as Gloved D-Class continues its
               walk, showing Guards oblivious to anything unusual...

                                                           CUT TO BLACK

=                                        ACT 1



               INT. SECURITY HALL SITE-76

               HIGH SHOT of an enormous hall, with many types of personnel
               busily navigating the hall and adjacent corridors. The feel
               is one of a modern high-tech military research complex. We
               see the following text overlaid on the scene, in two lines:
               "Foundation Site-76";"Somewhere in the United States
               Midwest". In upper right corner of the shot we see 3 figures
               (among others) entering the scene, and we...

[[>]]
                                                                CUT TO:
[[/>]]

               WIDE SHOT of Foundation AGENT SIMON GREY, flanked by 2
               Foundation GUARDS, walking forward as the SHOT TRACKS BACK. 

               As we shall learn over the course of the series, the
               Foundation is a global clandestine organization dedicated to
               securing and containing anomalous objects, beings, and
               phenomena, thereby protecting humanity and the world against
               a breach of "normalcy".

               Agent Grey is a Containment Specialist and Junior Agent for
               the Foundation. He is in his 50's, wearing an ill-fitting
               jacket and fedora, and carries a messenger bag. He is a
               lifer, and works at Site-19, the Foundation's largest
               containment site. He is short on formal education, which
               makes him unusual compared to most Foundation personnel. But
               Grey makes up for this with experience and a gut instinct
               about anomalies. He seems more comfortable with the anomalous
               world than most people. Both these facts put some distance
               between Grey and many of his colleagues.

               CLOSE IN on Grey's face, looking distracted.

[[>]]
                                                                CUT TO:
[[/>]]



               INT. AGENT KLIKS' OFFICE SITE-76 (FLASHBACK)

               In a flashback, we see Agent Grey in the Site-76 office of
               AGENT THEO KLIKSOFAKUS ("KLIKS"). Flashbacks all have
               slightly hazy borders in the overall shot.

               Kliks is a Senior Field Agent for the Foundation. He is in
               his 30s, and is nattily dressed in a tailored suit and
               expensive shoes. Under his jacket is a shimmering waistcoat
               tailored from Foundation ballistic chainmail. Kliks carries a
               concealed sidearm and blade. Kliks is sophisticated, well
               traveled, and cynical.
               He is also well-connected to rival groups to the Foundation,
               rendering some of his methods questionable even by Foundation
               standards.

               Kliks' office is a mix of both Euro taste and tackiness.
               Behind his chair is a grid of 9 computer monitors, with one a
               3D heads-up display, currently showing a lizard-like creature
               suspended in an aqueous medium. His fixtures include both
               spare and ornate pieces which somehow seem to go together,
               just barely. Off in a corner, we see a small display of
               trophies, and if we could see the details, we would see
               various 2nd and 3rd place finishes (or lower) in chess,
               squash, bridge, golf, and the like.

               OVER THE SHOULDER SHOT of Grey sitting across Kliks'
               conference table, looking at the table's embedded Foundation
               data station. We will see this object in several iterations:
               a monitor and flush keyboard, with a glass panel to the left
               of the keyboard. On the monitor we see the headshot of a
               young woman, with underlying text reading: "Mahto, Jagruti
               (JR Cand.)", plus other surrounding text in much smaller
               font. Grey pushes away from the table and stands. WIDE SHOT
               of Grey standing and Kliks sitting in his chair, feet up on
               the table, not looking up from his phone. 

[[=]]
                                   GREY
                         Sorry, Kliks, not seeing what the
                         higher ups are seeing.
[[/=]]

               ANGLE ON Kliks, still not looking up.

[[=]]
                                   KLIKS
                         The "higher ups" include me,
                         Special Agent.
[[/=]]

               ANGLE ON Grey, who rolls his eyes at this and turns away.
               ANGLE ON Kliks, who now looks up, and alternate in turn.

[[=]]
                                   KLIKS (CONT'D)
                         And you're exactly like Mahto's
                         university advisors, Grey, which is
                         all to the Foundation's benefit.

                                   GREY
                         Look, I'm the last person to judge
                         anyone's academic results, but
                         isn't 10 years a long time to get a
                         PhD, even with her early start? She
                         just seems...scattered.

                                   KLIKS
                         Precisely why we want her. She has
                         interests and skills beyond the one
                         degree that her school made her
                         choose. Another "oddball" that the
                         Foundation plucks from academia
                         with none the wiser.

                                   GREY
                         Fine, what do I know? Just tell me
                         when to come back and see if she
                         wants to take the red pill.

                                   KLIKS
                         Two weeks or less, mark me. She'll
                         love it here.
[[/=]]

               Kliks reaches into a desk drawer and draws out an object.
               CLOSE IN as he brings the object to the table top. It is a
               metal disk identical to the communications jammer used by the
               traitorous Inside Guard. He touches the top and the blue glow
               infuses the room. ANGLE ON Kliks as he speaks to Grey.

[[=]]
                                   KLIKS (CONT'D)
                         And now, on to the next order of
                         business...
[[/=]]

               ANGLE IN and then PAN IN CLOSE on Grey as he looks
               uncomfortable.

[[>]]
                                                                CUT TO:
[[/>]]



               INT. SECURITY HALL SITE-76

               CLOSE IN on Grey (matching prior scene) as he continues
               walking with Guards. REVERSE WIDE ANGLE as the group
               approaches the main security desk.



               INT. SECURITY DESK SITE-76

               WIDE SHOT of the desk, staffed by 4 receptionists interacting
               with various Foundation personnel. Grey's group reaches the
               desk. LOW SHOT looking up at Grey retrieving his phone, then
               OVER THE SHOULDER SHOT as Grey touches his phone to the glass
               panel of a desk data station. CLOSE IN on data station
               monitor as it shows a headshot of Grey, with the text "Agent
               Grey, Simon, Site-19" below, and a Foundation trefoil
               switching from blue to green. ANGLE ON the nearest
               RECEPTIONIST.

[[=]]
                                   RECEPTIONIST
                         Welcome back to Site-76, Agent
                         Grey.
[[/=]]

               ANGLE IN on Grey, and we then flash back to...



               INT. AGENT GREY'S OFFICE SITE-19 (FLASHBACK)

               Grey's office is the antithesis of Kliks' office. It is
               spare, messy, piled with papers and files, and reflects
               someone who is rarely there and does not care.

               First ANGLE IN on Grey looking down, then WIDE SHOT of Grey
               packing his messenger bag with some papers and personal
               items. His desk computer terminal (the only object on his
               desk apart from stacks of papers, and he has no conference
               table) sounds a notification, and he turns to address it.

               OVER THE SHOULDER SHOT of Grey answering the call. His
               monitor shows a live feed of COMMANDER YOO YOON-HEE (CMDR
               YOO), headshot only. Below the headshot is the text: "Cmdr.
               Yoo, Yoon-Hee, Site-76".

               Cmdr Yoo is in her 40s and is Chief of Security for Site-76.
               Starting from the bottom, she has only accepted promotion as
               long as she could stay "in the action," and routinely leads
               the fight alongside her troops. She is brave to the point of
               foolhardiness, much to the consternation of her superiors.
               But as a result, she inspires great loyalty in her troops.
               She is simultaneously charismatic and enigmatic, a source of
               much knowledge that goes nowhere.

               We see various Guard activity behind Cmdr Yoo, suggesting she
               is at work making this call.

               ANGLE IN on Cmdr Yoo and Grey in turn.

[[=]]
                                   CMDR YOO
                         (warmly) Hello, Agent Grey. Are you
                         well?

                                   GREY
                         (surprised) Commander! This is a
                         surprise, but it's always good to
                         hear from you. Why the call?

                                   CMDR YOO
                         We look forward to seeing you in
                         person when you pick up Dr. Mahto.

                                   GREY
                         Oh, I figured I'd just collect her
                         and go.
                         I arrive very early tomorrow, no
                         need to go out of your way.

                                   CMDR YOO
                         Whatever your plans, Agent, I need
                         to see you before you depart.
                         Please contact me.

                                   GREY
                         Of course, Commander. Is there any
                         reason I should know?

                                   CMDR YOO
                         Just make sure to look me up. And
                         safe travels, Agent.
[[/=]]

               Monitor restores to its neutral state, and we pan back to
               CLOSE IN on Grey, and then...



               INT. SECURITY DESK SITE-76

               CLOSE IN on Grey back at the security desk. ANGLE IN on
               Receptionist, then Grey.

[[=]]
                                   RECEPTIONIST
                         Dr. Mahto is waiting for you in
                         Conference Room 23. Your escort
                         will take you there. (pause) Agent
                         Grey?

                                   GREY
                         (noticing) Ah, thank you. Guards,
                         let's go.
[[/=]]

               WIDE SHOT FROM REAR as Grey and Guards head towards one of
               the many corridors. FIX SHOT as they leave, and then...

[[>]]
                                                                CUT TO:
[[/>]]



               INT. CONFERENCE ROOM 23

               Room is small and sterile with a table, a few chairs, and a
               few fixtures for running meetings. The desk contains a
               standard Foundation data station. On the wall is a
               touchscreen, with a predominant red eye optical interface.
               This screen displays the Foundation trefoil in blue along
               with some text. In the background we see two travel bags.

               ANGLE ON door opening. Grey enters holding a Foundation
               touchpad, with GUARD #1 holding door, then closing it behind
               Grey.

[[=]]
                                   GREY
                         (to room) Dr. Mahto? I'm Agent
                         Simon Grey, from Site-19.
[[/=]]

               Shot CUTS TO DR. JAGRUTI MAHTO, standing behind the table.
               She is 26, fresh out of university after 10 years, though as
               a prodigy she entered at age 16. She is already wearing a
               Foundation issue white lab coat (black trefoil on the left
               breast), which covers a colorful shalwar kameez. Dr. Mahto is
               a brilliant researcher and scientist, but has only recently
               been recruited to the Foundation and does not fully
               understand what she has signed on for. ANGLE ON Grey and
               Mahto in turn.

[[=]]
                                   DR. MAHTO
                         Yes, that's me, but please, call me
                         Jagruti.

                                   GREY
                         With your background? (pause) Nah,
                         Doctor it is.

                                   DR. MAHTO
                         Well, if it is all right with you,
                         Agent Grey, I would like to call
                         you Simon. I hate all that macho
                         surname nonsense.

                                   GREY
                         Fine with me, Doc, though the
                         Foundation IS a macho surname kind
                         of place. Please, sit.

               They both sit at the table.

                                   DR. MAHTO
                         Regarding names, Simon, Theo
                         consistently referred to you as
                         "Special" Agent Grey.

                                   GREY
                         (chuckling) Theo? No one calls
                         Kliks Theo. His mother, maybe.
                         Anyway, that's a joke. I'm a
                         Containment Specialist and Junior
                         Agent. Kliks came up with Special
                         Agent. He means it like Special Ed.
                         (sarcastic) Hilarious!

                                   DR. MAHTO
                         (flatly) I see.

                                   GREY
                         (looks up one more item on
                         touchpad, then settles in) OK, look
                         Doctor. I'm here to make sure this
                         is the right decision. The
                         Foundation is like a roach motel:
                         deciding you made a mistake joining
                         is a big deal that's hard to undo.
                         The amnestics involved are
                         unpleasant. So I only have one
                         question for you, same one I have
                         for all new researchers: Why? Why
                         the Foundation? I mean, someone
                         like you, you must have had a ton
                         of other options.

                                   DR. MAHTO
                         (pause) That is not so true, Simon.
                         The usual positions I would pursue
                         require that I focus on a single
                         topic. My Foundation recruiter said
                         that I would be able to indulge all
                         of my areas of interest. That the
                         Foundation has ongoing research in
                         both Hyperdimensional Quantum
                         Mechanics AND Computational
                         Linguistics was a dream come true.

                                   GREY
                         Ah, yeah. I can imagine. (he cannot
                         imagine) But it's all in the
                         service of the Foundation. You get
                         that, right?

                                   DR. MAHTO
                         Yes, of course, Simon. (like
                         reading a brochure) My knowledge
                         will help the Foundation secure and
                         contain anomalous objects and
                         phenomena, thereby protecting
                         humanity and maintaining baseline
                         normalcy. Secure, contain, and
                         protect!

                                   GREY
                         (pause, cynically) Right, exactly
                         what's on the tin. But do you get
                         it? The anomalous world is not just
                         some book of monsters and magic
                         items from a role-playing game.
                         It's a lot weirder than that. You
                         need to-

               A loud klaxon sounds. CLOSE SHOT on wall touchscreen that is
               now flashing red, and the words "Containment Breach" surround
               the trefoil. Inside the center of the trefoil is a letter K,
               indicating that the breach is a Keter class anomaly, the most
               severe class, above both Safe and Euclid (medium risk). A
               Keter breach is both rare and extremely dangerous.

               WIDE SHOT of both Grey and Mahto reacting.

                                   GREY (CONT'D)
                         (instinctively) Containment

                         Keter? (stands) Are we in danger?

                                   GREY
                         (stands) Don't know. (thinking)
                         God, what's Keter in this place?
                         (to Mahto) We have to get you to a
                         safe room. This isn't one. (takes
                         her arm) Leave your stuff, and do
                         exactly what I say. Let's go!

                         breach?

                                   GUARD #2
                         I don't even know what it is, sir,
                         just need to get you there, stat.

               MOVING SHOT of Grey, Mahto, and Guards approaching. They then
               stop short. REVERSE ANGLE shows 2 Guards positioned around a
               containment cell door to the left. Two Guards are prone on
               the floor, apparently dead by snapped necks. In front of
               door, but with some space, Kliks and Cmdr Yoo are flanked by
               4 Guards. ANGLE IN on Kliks and Cmdr Yoo as they draw their
               sidearms.

               Cmdr Yoo wears a Foundation ballistic martial arts suit,
               similar to a ninja's traditional garment. She is
               conspicuously armed with a holstered machine pistol, a long
               blade strapped to her leg, and a short riot baton dangling
               from her belt. Kliks wears a different suit from the
               flashback but is otherwise similarly attired.

=                                        ACT 2



               INT. CONTAINMENT CELL OF SCP-140

               ANGLE ON the inside of the cell through the door. The
               anomalous humanoid holding the curved knife, our former
               Gloved D-Class, is a SARKITE, a member of the Sarkic Cults,
               one of many Groups of Interest (GoI) that compete/cooperate
               with the Foundation as they navigate the anomalous world. The
               Sarkic Cults are characterized by worship of power over
               ethics, and strength through adversity, amongst other,
               stranger things.

               The Sarkite is of ambiguous sex, wears minimal clothing, and
               is covered in tattoos. It also appears to have several
               pustules and lesions, as Sarkites venerate disease. It is
               this Sarkite that caused the breach of containment of SCP
               140. It may be possible to see the Sarkite's discarded armor,
               as well as a mask resembling a mannequin's face, on the
               floor.

               Almost immediately, the Sarkite crouches and then leaps out
               of the chamber in the manner of a large cat.



               INT. OUTSIDE CONTAINMENT CELL OF SCP-140

               CUT TO CMDR YOO, who collapses her jo stick back to a baton.
               SHOT TRACKS as she then executes a cartwheel and backflip
               towards the Sarkite.

               SLOW MOTION PROFILE SHOT of the Sarkite hovering face down
               over Cmdr Yoo mid-air, with Cmdr Yoo facing up. Cmdr Yoo
               extends her jo stick again, and twists her body to bring it
               in contact with the Sarkite's knife just before it strikes
               her.

               SHOT TO REALTIME FOLLOWING as the knife hurls towards KLIKS,
               who catches the knife and guides it into the wall. CUT BACK
               to Sarkite and Cmdr Yoo, who each land on their feet, but
               interchanged relative to their starting positions.

               ANGLE ON Sarkite who immediately runs towards a GUARD near
               Kliks, running over the Guard, breaking the Guard's neck with
               its legs, and scaling the wall to the ceiling.

               [Choreography Notes: What follows is 30-60 seconds of martial
               arts combat between the Sarkite, Cmdr Yoo and Kliks, with
               some assists by the Guards. The following are suggested
               components of this scene: 1) the Sarkite fights anomalously,
               able to scale walls and crawl on ceilings, and leap over
               opponents to land behind them;
               2) Cmdr Yoo and Kliks are practitioners of aikido Foundation
               style, which incorporates acrobatics to mimic certain
               anomalous techniques (e.g. longer hang times, running up
               walls); 3) Cmdr Yoo is more skilled than Kliks, but it should
               be clear that both are needed to take down the Sarkite; 4) a
               few Guards should be injured during the fight, and one more
               should be killed, as they attempt to block and herd the
               Sarkite into position.]

               Near the start of the fight, the following exchange occurs,
               ANGLE ON GREY and DR. MAHTO as they watch the fight with
               their attending GUARDS:

[[=]]
                                   DR. MAHTO
                         Simon, WHAT is that?

                                   GREY
                         Looks like a Sarkite.

                                   DR. MAHTO
                         Sarkite?

                                   GREY
                         Member of the Sarkic Cults. That's
                         our breach.
[[/=]]

               Near the end of the fight, similar shot:

[[=]]
                                   DR. MAHTO
                         This is both amazing and
                         terrifying, Simon!

                                   GREY
                         It's aikido, Foundation-style. Yoon
                         hee is a grandmaster.

                                   DR. MAHTO
                         But Theo is skilled as well!

                                   GREY
                         Yeah, Kliks may be a douchebag, but
                         he's a badass douchebag.
[[/=]]

               At the end of the main fight, Cmdr Yoo and Kliks seemed to
               have the Sarkite encircled, but the Sarkite leaps out of
               their grasp. CUT TO Grey and Mahto's group, as the Sarkite
               lands on a Guard behind Mahto, killing the Guard. The Sarkite
               then puts Mahto in a choke hold.

[[=]]
                                   SARKITE
                         (same voice as the Teaser
                         voiceover) I will take this one's
                         head off, you know I will-
[[/=]]

               Suddenly, Dr. Mahto slips out of the hold and hip throws the
               Sarkite, sending it sprawling back into the chamber. Two
               Guards administer simultaneous Taser shots, and a third Guard
               administers a mist treatment to the face that renders the
               Sarkite unconscious.

               WIDER OVERHEAD SHOT of the entire group looking at Dr. Mahto
               in disbelief, then ANGLE IN on Dr. Mahto.

               activity, ZOOM IN as she speaks.

                                   CMDR YOO
                         OK, people, I have to continue the

                         Yes, sir! Let's move it, my

               Cmdr Yoo leaves with 2 Guards. After a moment, the klaxon
               ceases in the immediate area, though it is still heard off in
               the distance. Twelve (12) more Guards (2nd Team) enter.

               CUT TO Kliks approaching the Guards securing the Sarkite.

                         Get this abomination on its feet.
[[/=]]

               Four Guards heave the unconscious Sarkite to its feet, two
               each grabbing arms/legs. Kliks picks up one of the Sarkite's
               hands (CLOSE SHOT), and notices a long knife cut across the
               palm which is already in the early stages of forming a scar.
               He glances back at the knife in the wall (CLOSE SHOT) and we
               see no trace of blood. Where did the blood go?

               Kliks removes a small metal cylinder from his breast pocket
               (CLOSE SHOT), and (OVER SHOULDER) uses it to spray something
               in the Sarkite's face. The Sarkite immediately comes to,
               coughing and sputtering. The Guards straighten up the Sarkite
               as Kliks moves closer. ANGLE ON each in turn.

[[=]]
                                   SARKITE
                         You cannot stop it. We will remake
                         the world.

                                   KLIKS
                         You couldn't remake my bed. Why do
                         you even want them here? They'd
                         exterminate your kind without a
                         thought. Enjoy it, even.

                                   SARKITE
                         They are a worthy enemy. The
                         battles would be epic. Unlike you
                         pathetic weaklings. Their world is
                         preferred to yours.

                                   KLIKS
                         You mean the pathetic weaklings who
                         kicked your ass? Who's with you?

                                   SARKITE
                         Thirteen to one. I'm SO impressed
                         by you healthy ones. And I got what
                         I wanted regardless. You know you
                         will get nothing.

                                   KLIKS
                         Not now, perhaps. But it's another
                         story once the Church of the Broken
                         God gets their claws on you. I
                         can't wait to make that trade. I'll

                                   GREY
                         What? No, the Sarkite caused the

                         Competition, Doc. We're not the

                                   KLIKS
                         (pause) Both Killman and Rodriguez

                                   GREY
                         BOTH of them are away? Kliks...

                                   KLIKS
                         (angrily) Yes, it's sabotage, I

                         Doctor, I know we're way in the
                         deep end, but please, stay with us.
                         Kliks, we need to give Dr. Mahto
                         documentation rights for 140. You
                         can second, yes?

                                   KLIKS
                         Of course, it's you who shouldn't
                         have access.

                                   GREY

                         certain.

                                   GREY
                         How do you know one of your double

                         Way ahead of you, Special Agent.
                         We've already found two traitors
                         that helped the Sarkite. Two DEAD

                         were actually traitors. Dupes,

               INT. CONTAINMENT CELL OF SCP-140

               [Director's Note: This act consists mostly of Agent Grey
               sitting at a table, conversing with a computer, and flipping
               through pages of a book. The challenge is to give this the
               same tension as if Grey were disarming an explosive device.]

               The cell is a small room, like a very spare office. It
               contains only a single desk with a standard Foundation data
               terminal. On a shelf on the desk is the book, SCP-140.

               ANGLE ON open door, as GREY enters the room carrying the SCP
               140 copy. The copy is twice as thick as the real book. Grey
               briefly glances back as the door closes behind him.

               CLOSE SHOT of SCP-140, then CLOSE SHOT of Grey, who winces in
               pain. An electrical effect is seen around Grey's head, and
               unintelligible murmuring is heard. Grey shakes his head 
               clear, and speaks to the desk.

               ANGLE ON desk as Grey walks to it and sits down, setting the

               phone and touches it to panel to the keyboard's left (Grey
               does not use a smartwatch, unlike the majority of Foundation

                                   GREY
                         Could have been worse. Damn Sarkite

                         Roger, Control.
[[/=]]

               Grey takes SCP-140 from the shelf, and holding it in his
               hand, he opens the front cover. On the inside front cover is
               a bizarre, twisting signature, almost serpentine in nature.
               It seems to shimmer, even change shape slightly, as if alive.
               Again Grey winces in pain, sees the electrical crackle, hears
               the murmurs. He slams the cover shut, shakes his head clear,
               and places SCP-140 back on the shelf. 

[[=]]
                                   GREY (CONT'D)
                         Check, Control. Signature is

               As the stopwatch ticks down, Grey rifles the pages of SCP
               140. It becomes quickly apparent that SCP-140 has far too
               many pages to fit inside a book of its size. Numerous JUMP
               CUTS between the book, stopwatch, and Grey's face.
               Grey whistles at one point while he flips. Finally, the
               stopwatch reads zero and a chime sounds. Grey is still
               rifling pages with no end in sight. He again slams the book
               closed, replaces it on the shelf, and wipes his brow with his
               sleeve.

[[=]]
                                   GREY
                         Check, Control. Page count is
                         really anomalous.

                         that you possess the genuine SCP
                         140. Do you concur?

                                   GREY
                         Affirmative, Control. This is the
                         creepy ass book known as SCP-140.

                                   CONTROL
                         Keep it professional, Agent.

                                   GREY
                         Sorry, Control. It's been a long

               Grey picks up the archive copy this time, turns the book over

               hears Grey just fine. Grey finishes his sentence:

                         Of course we do, the O's have
                         spoken. But it won't be quick.
[[/=]]

               Frustrated, Grey snatches SCP-140 off the shelf, turns to the
               back page. Montage of CLOSE SHOTS as Grey pours over pages,
               attempting to find the requested information. Because Grey
               must read more, there are a few more instances of SCP-140
               trying to get into Grey's head. He becomes noticeably
               fatigued. Finally, Grey examines a passage more intently, and
               seems to calm down a bit.

[[=]]
                                   GREY (CONT'D)
                         Grey here, Control. I think I found
                         the information. And it's not so
                         bad. I think the new preliminary
                         extinction date is-(AutoDacted)

                                   CONTROL
                         (pause) Roger, Grey, that does
                         sound like good news. Relatively.

                                   GREY
                         Yeah, looks like most of the new
                         pages are descriptions of rituals
                         and stuff. The Daevas didn't live
                         all that much longer.

                                   CONTROL
                         Roger, Grey. (pause) But we still
                         can't stop it from happening again.

                                   GREY
                         No, not yet.

                                   CONTROL
                         (pause) Agent Grey, Control is
                         satisfied that SCP-140 is back in
                         preliminary containment. Do you
                         concur?

                                   GREY
                         (pause, quietly) Yeah, I guess so.
                         (pause, normally) I concur that SCP
                         140 is back in preliminary
                         containment. (pause) Recommend that
                         we activate Mobile Task Force Zeta
                         9.

                                   CONTROL
                         They've already been notified.

                                   GREY
                         (pause) God help the Grave Diggers.
                         Or anyone else who can help.
                         (pause) Requesting permission to
                         close log on SCP-140.

                                   CONTROL
                         Permission granted. Be safe, Grey.

                                   GREY
                         Great advice for us all, Control.
                         End log.
[[/=]]

               The screen dictation finishes with "<END LOG>", and the
               trefoil returns, now in green. The breach is closed. Grey
               puts SCP-140 back on the shelf, pushes back his chair, rubs
               his eyes, and inhales deeply. He rises, picking up the now
               obsolete backup copy. ANGLE ON door as Grey approaches, and
               keys in a code on the panel to the right. The door clicks
               open a crack. Grey pulls the door open, and leaves the cell.



               INT. OUTSIDE CONTAINMENT CELL OF SCP-140

               CLOSE SHOT of Grey emerging from doorway. He stops with an
               expression of surprise. REVERSE POV Grey reveals DR. MAHTO
               standing just outside the doorway, with a very concerned
               look.

[[=]]
                                   GREY
                         Doc! How, how long have you been
                         here?

                                   DR. MAHTO
                         Not long, the lockdown ended 5
                         minutes ago. I came here straight
                         away. (takes a step towards Grey)
                         Simon, I have been studying SCP
                         140. My God, Simon, I had no idea
                         such things were possible...

                                   GREY
                         Not in front of the guards. Let's
                         find a conference room.

               INT. NEARBY SITE-76 CONFERENCE ROOM

               ANGLE ON Dr. Mahto bursting through the door, followed more
               slowly by Grey. Dr. Mahto is agitated and paces throughout
               the scene.

[[=]]
                                   DR. MAHTO
                         Simon, you told me that the
                         anomalous world was not just some
                         collection of monsters and magic
                         items from a role playing game. But
                         I realize now that I had no idea
                         what else there could be. I had no
                         idea that anything like SCP-140 was
                         even possible.

                                   GREY
                         Well, technically, 140 is one hell
                         of a magic item that can bring
                         forth one hell of a horde of
                         monsters.

                                   DR. MAHTO
                         But Simon...am I understanding this
                         correctly? SCP-140 is re-writing
                         history?

                                   GREY
                         Trying to rewrite history is more
                         accurate. But yes, every time it
                         gets close to anything that looks
                         like ink. 

                                   DR. MAHTO
                         So was that Sarkite...was it...

                                   GREY
                         It was ritually cutting itself.
                         Blood is the best ink of all. God,
                         that sounds like a schlock horror
                         movie, doesn't it? But Yoon-hee and
                         crew responded very quickly, and
                         those Sarkic rituals drag out
                         forever. It could have been a lot
                         worse.

                                   DR. MAHTO
                         So that is why you told Theo to not
                         use weapons.

                                   GREY
                         That was mostly for the guards.
                         They have the assault rifles.

                                   DR. MAHTO
                         But why would that Sarkite want to
                         activate 140? Doesn't it realize
                         what would happen?

                                   GREY
                         Realize? They're counting on it!
                         The Sarkic Cults would like nothing
                         better than to bring the Daevas
                         into today. It's better than a
                         world of us weak normals, at any
                         rate. In a fair fight, my money's
                         on the Daevas, that's how crazy the
                         Sarkites are.

                                   DR. MAHTO
                         Yes, from what I have read, the
                         Daevas sound like Aztecs or Mongols
                         with magic powers! It is madness
                         that anyone would want such a race
                         to exist today.

                                   GREY
                         Now, Dr. Killman was very clear
                         that...thaumaturgy?...is not magic.
                         "Miracle working" I think he called
                         it. But yeah, that plus the
                         cannibalism and ritual sacrifices
                         do not sound fun. Except to the
                         Sarkites. They would love that
                         shit. "Will to power," they call
                         it. Allowing the Daevas to live
                         into the future would be heaven on
                         earth for them, even if it's a war
                         they would lose.

                                   DR. MAHTO
                         So every time it happens, a 140
                         breach, the Daevas live for longer.
                         Prior military defeats become
                         setbacks, and eventually victories.
                         How far have they advanced this
                         time?

                                   GREY
                         Sorry, Doc, you may have
                         documentation access, but those
                         details are top secret. As Kliks
                         never gets tired of saying, it's
                         amazing that I get to know.
[[/=]]

               Dr. Mahto sits down in a conference chair, a bit calmer.

[[=]]
                                   DR. MAHTO
                         So is everything done for now?
                         Until the next breach, that is?
[[/=]]

               Grey sits next to Dr. Mahto.

[[=]]
                                   GREY
                         No, it's not. (pause) I don't know
                         if you read this far, but
                         sometimes, (pause) 140 expands on
                         its own. No blood, no ink, no
                         nothing. It just gets longer.
                         That's why it's Keter. If it always
                         required ink to expand, it might
                         just be classified Safe.

                                   DR. MAHTO
                         (with some horror) Then...we are
                         not safe at all. (pause) SCP-140 is
                         not actually contained! It is only
                         a matter of time. 

                                   GREY
                         And once it expands far enough, we
                         get a CK-Class Reality
                         Restructuring scenario. We all bow
                         down to the Daevas and their witch
                         king, or whatever it is. And the
                         worst part is that the Foundation
                         would be exposed to the world.

                                   DR. MAHTO
                         (disbelief) How can that be the
                         worst part, Simon? What about all
                         the lives that would be lost? The
                         horrible impact on humanity?

                                   GREY
                         (serious, slowly) Doctor, nothing,
                         and I mean nothing, is worse than
                         an LV-Class Lifted Veil scenario.
                         The world cannot function unless
                         the Foundation remains a secret.
                         You have to believe that if you
                         want to work here.

                                   DR. MAHTO
                         (resigned) It seems hopeless,
                         Simon. I had no idea of the
                         magnitude of what the Foundation
                         was doing. I did not understand at
                         all.

                                   GREY
                         That's why we need you, Doctor.
                         Someday, you might figure out why
                         the expansions happen. Maybe you'll
                         figure out how to stop them
                         entirely.

                                   DR. MAHTO
                         How would I ever do that, Simon?

                                   GREY
                         Beats me. I don't understand
                         anything about your work. But I
                         know that's why you're here. Why
                         we're all here, trying to do our
                         best. (long pause) There's one
                         other thing about this breach
                         that's not done.

                                   DR. MAHTO
                         What is that?

                                   GREY
                         When the Daevas live longer, they
                         leave behind more artifacts.
                         Graves. The Foundation has
                         archeologists onsite at Daeva digs.
                         Yesterday, those sites were dug up
                         and empty. But today, the Daevas
                         have lived for longer. And so the
                         Foundation is going to have to look
                         at those sites again. And when they
                         do...

                                   DR. MAHTO
                         Oh my Lord, Simon, you mean, those
                         sites will have...artifacts in them
                         again?

                                   GREY
                         And don't forget: thaumaturgy!
                         Cannibalism! You can't just start
                         digging willy-nilly.

                                   DR. MAHTO
                         So what does the Foundation do?

                         time.

                                   MAJOR STANTON
                         Then why do you want to stay,
                         Doctor? Isn't that what you want to
                         see? Anyway, I don't have the
                         luxury to contemplate that
                         possibility. More people could die
                         if did.

                         It will make me feel better.

               INT. AGENT'S KLIKS' OFFICE SITE-76

               The once ornate office is now nearly empty of lived-in

               two large taped-up boxes on the floor. Next to these are two
               expensive-looking overnight bags.

               Kliks is pacing the office, talking on a cheap cellphone that
               looks like a "burner". He is wearing a summer scarf in the
               European style, as well as a hat. He looks ready to travel.

[[=]]
                                   KLIKS
                         Of course I want access to the

                         But your cost is too high.
                         (extended pause) I'll have to think

                         that sounds much better. But I have
                         to leave you now. I'm on the move.

               Kliks shuts off the phone, grins at it, then tosses it into a

               walking to the Security Desk. Grey has his messenger bag, and
               each Guard is carrying a travel bag belonging to Dr. Mahto.
               The mood is subdued.

                                   DR. MAHTO
                         How can you be so calm, Simon?

                                   GREY
                         You go insane otherwise.

                                   DR. MAHTO
                         Maybe we should be a little insane.
                         43 people died today.

                                   GREY
                         Trust me, most of us are. As for
                         Zeta-9, (pause) look, they knew the
                         score. Mobile Task Forces are our
                         best, but that means they get the
                         tough jobs. Sometimes they're
                         impossible.

                                   GREY (CONT'D)
                         Doctor. (pause) Jagruti. It usually
                         happens slower. Getting used to the
                         Foundation, I mean. Today, (pause)
                         today you saw more than some new
                         researchers see in 3 years. It can
                         be awful on the best days. Anyway,
                         you saw it. Now you have to stop
                         feeling sorry for yourself and get
                         on with it.

                                   DR. MAHTO
                         I am not feeling sorry for myself!
                         I just don't know what I can do for
                         the Foundation. I, I think I made
                         the wrong decision.

                                   GREY
                         I guess that old saying is right,
                         then.

                                   DR. MAHTO
                         Which one is that?

                                   GREY
                         The truth hurts.

                                   DR. MAHTO
                         Does that even apply here, Simon?

                                   GREY
                         Probably not, I'm bad at this
                         stuff. I'm just saying, you saw the
                         truth, Doctor. More than most
                         people will. And yeah, most people
                         don't want the truth, because it
                         hurts. But you're a scientist. I
                         don't know, I'm not one, but I
                         thought that the truth was
                         everything to scientists. When you
                         do an experiment, or whatever, do
                         you give up if it doesn't work the
                         way you wanted?

                                   DR. MAHTO
                         No, not if you are a good
                         scientist. Sometimes, the failures
                         provide the most information.

                                   GREY
                         Then you're in the right place,
                         Doctor. Lotta failure here. Goes
                         with the territory.

                                   DR. MAHTO
                         If I could figure out the mechanism
                         for SCP-140 expansion, it would be
                         fantastic. More meaningful than
                         anything I have worked on to date.

                                   GREY
                         Yes, that would be great.

                                   DR. MAHTO
                         140 seems able to convert a certain
                         form of matter to temporal energy.
                         If we could monitor local quantum
                         entanglement during an expansion
                         event- 

                                   GREY
                         Doctor-

                                   DR. MAHTO
                         -we could measure the changes in
                         entanglement correlation, and see
                         how it applies to the local quantum
                         field! Then-

                                   GREY
                         DOCTOR. I. Have. No. Idea what
                         you're talking about. But I'm glad
                         you do. Let's get you to Site-19. I

                         dabble in whatever I deem most
                         important across the entire grid.
                         Don't worry, Grey, I'll give you a
                         taste now and then.

                                   GREY
                         (looking at the group) Well, two
                         out of three isn't bad.

                                   CMDR YOO
                         If it's any consolation, Agent, we

                         With us both at Site-19 it will be
