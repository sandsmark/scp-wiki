[[tab Introduction]]
++ Introduction

> **Engineering:** Engineering is the application of mathematics, as well as scientific, economic, social, and practical knowledge to invent, innovate, design, build, maintain, research, and improve structures, machines, tools, systems, components, materials, processes, solutions, and organizations.[[footnote]] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering [[/footnote]]

In-universe, most of the Foundation's containment successes can be undoubtedly attributed to the engineering staff and professionals that design and implement the containment procedures and devices used across the Foundation's sites. Yes, scientists and researchers find out how an object works, but it is the engineering department's job to take that knowledge and make it practical.

++ Containment and You
//aka: why are Level 4 personnel directly touching SCPs?//

One of the primary duties of a Foundation engineering specialist, and perhaps the most critical, would be to experiment with, approve, and implement effective containment protocols for the various threats and anomalies that the Foundation contains. A seemingly minor mistake could end fatally for the researchers and containment staff that rely on effective containment procedures to protect them.

As a writer, creating effective containment procedures shows others that you did your research and thought carefully about what the anomaly is, and the measures the Foundation takes to keep it contained from the world. Well-written containment procedures are similar to a well-fitted tuxedo or a beautiful gown - the work shows, and draws people in.

[[tab Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)]]
++ Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
Personnel who are required to be in close proximity to a contained SCP or to subjects/structures affected by an SCP should be wearing appropriate protective gear. Examples of protective gear would include the following:

||~ Protection Available ||~ Hazard Indicated ||
|| **Work Boots** || Sharp items on ground, wet environments, potential exposure to live electricity, slippery environments, cold and hot environments ||
|| **Gloves** || Absorption-based chemicals, strong acids/bases, cold/hot objects, sharp objects ||
|| **Ear Muffs** || Auditory SCPs, loud noises from machinery ||
|| **Eye Shields** || Projectiles, dusts, liquids, aerosols ||
|| **UV Eye Shading** || Strong UV sources, welding processes ||
|| **Face Shields** || Situations where full facial protection is required, and eye shields alone are not sufficient ||
|| **Dust Masks** || Basic dusts (will NOT protect against petroleum vapors, toxic gases/dusts, or bad atmospheres ||
|| **Vapor Masks** || Basic dusts and petrol-based vapors (will NOT protect against toxic gases/dusts or bad atmospheres) ||
|| **Gas Masks** || Basic dusts, petrol-based vapors, toxic gases/dusts (will NOT protect against bad atmospheres) ||
|| **Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA)** || Basic dusts, petrol-based vapors, toxic gases/dusts, bad atmospheres ||
|| **Tyvek Suit** || Strong acids/bases, toxic materials and dusts ||
|| **Hazardous Materials Suit** || Strong acids/bases, toxic materials, liquids, and dusts, bad atmospheres ||
|| **Hard Hats** || Falling objects, low headspace areas ||
|| **Fall Harnesses** || Falls ||

[[tab Administrative Controls]]
++ Administrative Controls

> Administrative controls are training, procedure, policy, or shift designs that lessen the threat of a hazard to an individual. [[footnote]] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_controls [[/footnote]]
Administrative controls enforce hazard control via manipulating operator behavior. This is usually performed via on-the-job training, seminars, and continual improvement projects aimed at reducing potential exposure to a hazard.

Examples of administrative controls would be as follows:
||~ Example ||~ Explanation||
|| **Prohibition of touching SCPs** || Certain SCPs may exhibit anomalous or deleterious effects via touch. Training, in conjunction with protective barriers and PPE, will provide an additional barrier against accidental contact. ||
|| **Warning Signage** || Warning signs are used to signal that a specific threat exists, and may serve to heighten personnel awareness and caution when conducting operations in the hazard area. ||
|| **Maintenance Schedules** || Maintenance schedules are designed to reduce the likelihood of an essential or critical piece of machinery failing at an inopportune time, as well as providing more data to improve existing processes and devices. ||

The Foundation works by //containing// its objects, and tailoring containment to account for whatever anomaly is present. As each object is considered a hazard, isolating the hazard from its workers ensures that there is a lessened exposure to risk for most Foundation personnel.

The Foundation has a variety of engineering controls available through industrial and medical advances, as indicated below. All of these serve the purpose of isolating the user from the hazard.

||~ Control Method ||~ Explanation ||
|| Machine Fences || Fences, made from steel bars or acrylic sheets, are utilized in industry to assist in preventing inadvertent access to the protected zone within the fence perimeters. ||
|| Light Curtains || Invisible (laser or IR) beams between an emitter/receiver pair "guard" an opening in a permanent/semi-permanent barrier. Breaking the beam will activate a safety mechanism, which is usually stoppage of a machine. ||
|| Gloveboxes || Gloveboxes allow for sensitive work to be completed within its confines, vapor-sealed from the outside environment via air locks and other mechanisms. True to its name, there are glove protrusions that allow users to work with objects inside the box. ||
|| Airlocks || Airlocks are partitions with sealed doors, utilized to allow people and materials to traverse between two zones of different atmospheres or pressures, without those two zones intermingling. ||
|| Remote Manipulators || Remote manipulators usually consist of a large robotic arm, and a smaller manipulator or control pendant that is utilized by the operator in a different area, to control the larger arm. ||
|| HVAC Systems || HVAC systems utilized in engineering controls will be specifically routed to ensure that air moved through hazardous areas does not intermingle with air destined for common spaces, and that any air moving through a hazardous area is filtered prior to discharge. ||

This is by no means an exhaustive list - other isolating mechanisms do exist. This guide is just to give an introduction as to what mundane means exist that may be of use to you in your writing.

[[tab Esoteric Controls]]
This being a fictional writing site, there are certain objects written in by other authors that are designed to make containment easier, and that do not exist in real life. This section is purposefully kept short, as this part is ultimately up to every individual author.

Some items that may be quoted as part of containment may consist as follows:
||~ Esoteric Control ||~ Explanation ||
|| **SCP-148** || The Telekill Alloy is noted for its properties of blocking telepathic signals. The mechanism behind this is currently unknown, and the material itself is rare and cannot be synthesized, as the data behind its creation was lost. It is uncommon to see this SCP utilized in containment procedures today, and its usage not encouraged. ||
|| **Scranton Reality Anchors (SRAs)** || SRAs are devices utilized to "enforce" reality around it, nullifying attempts at reality alteration performed around it. The strength of enforcement can be controlled, and such devices are nominally utilized to counteract reality-bending objects and entities. ||
|| **Thaumiel-Class Objects** || Thaumiel-class objects are SCPs specifically utilized to enforce containment of other SCPs, usually Keter-class objects or objects with potentially catastrophic consequences should containment fail. Thaumiel-class objects are a closely guarded secret, with their true existence and description generally only available to Overseer-level staff. ||

This is by no means an exclusive list, and other esoteric methods may be written as authors and stories continue to be created and evolve.
