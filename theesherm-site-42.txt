**Name/Title:** [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-049 Dr. Theron Sherman], Site Director of Site-42

**Known Aliases:** Sherm, TheeSherm, [http://www.scp-wiki.net/dado-hub thee sherbert], Sherman Sherman, The Sherminator, Sherman Tank, Sherman Hemsley, Sherwin Williams, Sherm the Worm, Shermy, P. Sherman 42 Wallaby Way Sydney, Sherman Klump, "Where's Mr. Peabody, Sherman?" 

**Hire Date:** ██/██/2015

**Reason for Joining The Foundation:** Honestly, I was just looking up monsters for a Dresden Files Tabletop Game that I was DMing (FATEcore, to be specific) when I found some cool monsters and joined the wiki for funsies. Then I just started using the SCPs as voice acting demos on YouTube because Creative Commons meant I wouldn't be sued. //Then// I saw people that were actually //watching// the videos and decided to start [https://www.youtube.com/c/theesherm42 Site-42]. //**THEN**// I got really hardcore and somehow wrote --three-- four SCP articles[[footnote]] Also, a Tale. [[/footnote]][[footnote]] Also also, voiced parts for numerous SCPs on the main site. Just check out the Articles tab. [[/footnote]]. And here you are on my Author Page. Go you. Welcome.

**Research Focus:** I have a two pronged thought process about my place in the community:

As an artist and emotional person, I wanted to make cool SCP stuff any way I could. Voiceover was my first route because acting was my easiest accessible skillset and I had a microphone on hand, then I made some video essays because I do some teaching and educating is a passion of mine, then I wrote some SCPs after I gained that confidence. Most of all, I wanted [http://www.youtube.com/c/theesherm42 Site-42] to be a contributing part of the SCP Community rather than being on the outside looking in. 

As a professional, I want to use my background in Theatre and Film to build a full-fledged, community funded production studio called Site-42 Studios. Our goal is to hire on actors, editors, tech crew, makeup artists, props makers, and use all these specialists to make the high-quality Live Action Adaptations of SCP Content that everybody wants to see. A big company like Netflix can’t own the SCP due to Creative Commons, so they won’t touch the license. It’s up to us as a fandom to coalesce and lift up our Content Creators so they can make the best stuff they can.

**Who made the sweet art for this author page?** That would be [[user Yossipossi]] on CSS and [[user smlt]] on the Site-42 logo.

**Hey, isn't A Random Day/Dr. Desai the Director of Site-42?** What? No. There is no canon. Shut up.

Super thanks to

[[user Yossipossi]]
[[user Modulum]]
 for speccing this before posting in the forums and on Discord.

Why is there text if this is //**SUPER IMPORTANT DON'T TYPE IT?!**// Because some people don't have headphones and the audio is eleven minutes so I'm okay with people suspending their disbelief.

Some thoughts random themes and thoughts that created or were created by this article:

A: What if Fred was malevolent and had SCP-3043's powers?

B: 
Audio Log 1: Hey, we have this dopey anomaly, let's poke it with a stick.
Audio Log 2: Nope, we should not have done that.

C: What if a fictional character just wanted people to care about it's creator?

[[collapsible show="+ SCP-3302: "The Jim Look"" hide="- hide"]]

[[[SCP-3302]]]

My first attempt at a short article with no gimmick.

Some random thoughts about this SCP:

Coldpost challenge: I wanted to see if I could go start to finish without help and make it work.

Inspiration can come from anywhere: I had a eureka moment in the middle of a stress state after reading an r/SCP writing prompt about “The Office box set that forces you to binge the whole thing.” I obviously went a different route, but still…

Rule of three: Very basic version in the interview. Test, test, not test. Set-up, repetition, subversion.

Series IV Stereotypes: This is short. It’s not meta. It’s not a world ender or even that dangerous.

The Final Addendum/Twist: The bulk of the article was written to be a stand-alone story about how it would suck to have people know when you thought they were stupid because I don’t think they mention how rude that would be in “The Office.” The final twist came to me right at the finish and I think it adds a nice WTF Weird at the end, and I only had to add 5 or 6 words to the interview to foreshadow it.

[[collapsible show="+ SCP-2700-EX: What I Did For Love" hide="- hide"]]

[[[SCP-2700-EX]]]

This is my first time writing a story with a personal reason; it actually made it harder for me because I knew what I was trying to say but I had to keep adding on more and more because I wasn't communicating that to the reader.

Also, if we need a skip for Breast Cancer Awareness Month, I got you fam.

Special thanks to 

[[user Westrin]] (for critting it multiple times)
[[user not_a_seagull]] (for the Draft Forum Crit)
[[user BlazingTrail]] (for having exceeding faith in the concept and a couple crits)
[[user Doctor Cimmerian]] (for a crit that cut to the heart of the issue in a thoroughly academic way)
[[user PhamtomGuy]] (especially for picking the appropriate SCP number)

Cliff's Notes to this Skip

SCP-2700-EX is breast cancer. Run of the mill, non-anomalous breast cancer.
Harold's wife got breast cancer. He made up the fact that it was contagious and made it sound super scary so the Foundation would research it.
He tried to use an SCP to cure it. It got worse.
He tried to get a cross-test with SCP-500, but was denied.
He tried to steal a pill of SCP-500. It didn't go well.
The Ethics Committee let him off easy.

[[[SCP-3802]]]

Thanks to [[User Westrin]], [[User Rat Lord]], and [[User MaliceAforethought]] for pushing me to make this a little more than it was, and thanks to [[User BlazingTrail]] for scoping it out near the finish.

Also thanks to [[User djkaktus]] for creating dado and approving of this iteration.

All-in-all, I just had that “hare growth” thing stuck in my head after reading dado stuff and had to get it out; thankfully the top of my head and other body parts stayed attached.

A little heartwarming:
I’m really happy with my headcanon that dado tried not to hurt the kids, even if he didn’t/chose not to understand what he was actually supposed to do.

A little horrifying:
I got some WTFs in crit for the Beta manifestation, so I’m happy about that.

I hope ya’ll enjoy it.

[[[Ignorance is Bliss]]]

Almost a Doomcon entry, now just part of a sweet canon we can build at a leisurely pace.

Thanks to The Whistleblowers for working with me on an excellent end-of-the-world that let me throw some characters in a hella unique situation and run wild with it for 8,500ish words.
[[User Yossipossi]] [[User Modulum]] [[User BlazingTrail]]

Also thanks to [[User Doctor Cimmerian]] for crit, [[User Cyantreuse]] for a thorough line-by-line, and [[User Westrin]] for letting me know that the jokes landed well.

__Notes about this Tale:__

Essentially, I got super excited when I thought about the idea of a Terminatoresque future apocalypse where the Pattern Screamers wrecked the planet, but there were still Foundation forces holding out because the Screamers only come after you if you know about them so when they're pinned down, the Agents self-amnesticize, and wake up in a 28 Days Later situation where they don't have a damn clue what's going on until they manage to get scooped up and retrained. Alan's cold open was pretty much my first idea from that train of thought.

My first thought was to have Alan essentially go through a cycle; wake up, get picked up and retrain, make friends with the team, go on a mission, shit goes bad, self-amnesticize at the last minute, and wake up to do it all again. Somewhere along the way, the team became singularly Brianna. I also found that I wanted her to be more capable than Alan (it made it interesting for him not to be the Greatest Soldier Evar TM) and as he realized that, it made sense that he was going to have to die to save her so she could fight on better than he could.

It was only an hour into writing it that I realized that I had never actually written a Tale before, that I didn't exactly know how to write one, and that the only time I had tried to write in first-person perspective before couldn't get off the ground. The Whistleblowers liked what I had from the first hour and that gave me the confidence to drive forth. From there, I essentially called on my experience from writing TTG campaigns to drive me through the story. (Where are we? What is located there? What do you do? What effect does that have? Where do you go next? Rinse, repeat.) and it drove me fairly well down the nearly 10,000 words. 

The nice thing about writing a story for a Tale versus a TTG is that while you are riffing, if you come up with an awesome idea, you can go back and build in foreshadowing after the fact. In my game nights, I'd always be going "Damn, that would have been awesome if I'd been leading up to that somehow," but for Ignorance, I could go back and add those Chekov's Guns and those plot threads that I'd thought of the ending for.

Special shoutout for Cimmerian and what I think is the brilliant idea for changing to third-person perspective after Alan dies. Just, so thematic, much meaning.

When [[user djKaktus]] said he and [[user Gabriel Jade]] were teaming up to rewrite SCP-049, I was excited. When he asked me to come in and do some voice acting for it opposite Volgun and [[user Doctor Cimmerian]], I was ecstatic. When it all turned out fantastically and also Dr. Theron Sherman is now a thing, well, now my mind is blown.

[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3317-audio SCP-3317 Audio]

While searching for articles to read, I discovered that [[User MaliceAforethought]]'s first article was also an infohazard that had to be contained via an audio file (the same schtick that I did for my first article, [[[SCP-3086]]]). I offered to record it for him so it could be done the same way, and [[User TSATPWTCOTTTADC]] tagged in to help and did the Russian voice wonderfully as well.

> We’re trying to turn Site-42 Studios into a fan-funded, online, film studio that makes high-quality SCP Content, stuff like the Live-Action Adaptations that we all keep talking about wanting to see. This is the only way we’ll be able to get high-quality short films due to the Creatives Commons License, which stops Netflix and Amazon from copyrighting it.
> 
>  The kind of quality I want to make requires hiring people, and hiring people requires money. I’ll be the guy that puts it together, and you can help me by pitching in via Patreon and Ko-Fi out of the goodness of your heart, or buy some Merch from the Site-42 store to both support us and get some sweet SCP swag out of the deal.
> 
> Even if you can't throw money at as, you can help spread the word and follow us on social media. The more we grow, the faster we can make the good stuff for you guys.

> [[user Westrin]]: "TheeSherm is the most consistent and clear SCP reader that I've ever seen. If there was a clinical speaking voice, Sherm would have it. Also he's a pretty big nerd so he gets points for that."

> [[user Yossipossi]]: "I haven't been into SCiP Dictations until I met TheeSherm. When I started watching, he was barely over 100 subs, and just started his readings. I'm so happy he recently surpassed 3k, and I hope his channel continues to grow."

> [[user djkaktus]]: “Westrin go listen to the reading sherm did at the end of this article [[[SCP-3208]]]. It’s so good. I just listened to it tonight. He’s very very good. They did so good, right? That’s like the best reading of anything I’ve ever written.”
