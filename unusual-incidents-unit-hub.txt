[[tab UIU File #20X6, A Formal Discussion]]

HOOVER: That's what we're setting out to do, sir.

HOOVER: Well, we're not like MacArthur. I'm really not some hard-headed fool who's going to take the Joint Chiefs hostage for my own personal vendetta. I'm here to figure out who the bad guys are, that's it.

[[span style="color:black; background-color: black"]] —— ——[[/span]]: [[span style="color:black; background-color: black"]]— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— [[/span]]

HOOVER: Ah, see, now that's what I like about you. You're going right to the point. Well, you've got all your boys down there for the reconstruction, and I know you've been finding some interesting cans. I think we're best suited to use them.


[[span style="color:black; background-color: black"]] —— ——[[/span]]: [[span style="color:black; background-color: black"]]— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— ——  —— —— —— —— ——[[/span]]

HOOVER: Because we're all American. None of us are some little hooligan you had to recruit because they were in the right place at the right time. We've got pure Americanism, through and through. I'd trust a real American with this sort of thing a lot more than some agency riddled with outside influences.

HOOVER: You could get them with those other boys and bring them to us. We'll figure out a way to make them useful.

[[span style="color:black; background-color: black"]] —— ——[[/span]]: [[span style="color:black; background-color: black"]]— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— [[/span]]

HOOVER: I trust that you've gotten the same intelligence reports on what's happening in the eastern bloc?

[[span style="color:black; background-color: black"]] —— ——[[/span]]: [[span style="color:black; background-color: black"]]— ——— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— — —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— [[/span]]

HOOVER: That's why we need to act quickly. I'm sure that you don't want the age of American atomic supremacy to end before it can begin?

[[span style="color:black; background-color: black"]] —— ——[[/span]]: [[span style="color:black; background-color: black"]]— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— [[/span]]

HOOVER: There's plenty we can use back home in addition to whatever scraps you haven't picked clean by this point. The crux of the matter is we need to do this quickly, before the GRU can get a leg up on it. That's what really matters. If this don't get into American hands, it'll end wrapped around their throats.
