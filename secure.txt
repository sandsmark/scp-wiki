Something is amiss
The balance of reality
Changes and suddenly tips
No longer fifty-fifty

Existence here is wrong
The sight, the sound, the feel
Like some melodious song
Created with notes unreal

Corner the anti-existing
Its presence itself is malign
Follow the non-thing twisting
The straight reality line

Ultimately it is malicious
Intent has no control
The good are the pernicious
The evil are clear vitriol

Remove it from the ignorant
Where its harm has the greatest effect
Do not let it run errant
This existential reject

Erase its presence from
The memory of Possibility
Since complete removal will become
An exercise in futility
