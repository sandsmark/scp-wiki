My first and most successful skip. Not much to say other than it was my first. I wrote it after my horribly failed two skips and one tale. [[footnote]] I honestly forget how many.[[/footnote]] I felt bummed out and sad, feeling like all of the hard work I had put in was all worthless. I was on the verge of quiting, but some people told me to keep on going. [[footnote]] Thank you all. I couldn't have done it with you all. [[/footnote]] So, I kept going. I didn't have an idea, but there was a contest that was about to give me one: The History Contest.

Prior to hearing about the contest, I had toyed with the idea of writing about an event known as the 'GOC-Foundation' war. I didn't have the motivation to actually write it up until the history contest. I deicded to write it up as a Alternate Reality Television phenomon that decided would broadcast from several different realities. But due to the lack of emotional interest, I decided for it to take place in one universe, with Napoleon taking power. 

I honestly do not know how it is my most popular.

This idea was originally used by a user known as Dr Dice. [[footnote]] If you are the original author, please contact me so I can attribute it to you as written and me as the rewrite author [[/footnote]] It did not last long, but I really, really loved the idea. An anomlous substance that can form these defensive structures? That sounded like an awesome idea! 

This rewrite: It was hell. I went through several different iterations, all with varying levels of quality. I eventually decided to take a break from it, and went on to doing another draft or two. I came back, and, after getting feedback from many different people, I decided to go back to the propsect of this being a Promethuse Labs. Product. 

The original version I published was aboslute garbage in my opinion. Like, I still cringe and wonder how the fuck it was not deleted. I did not want this to fail later on down the line. I wanted this to be //good//. And so, I rewrote the entire article, keeping the things that I liked and thought were good and scrapping the stuff that was bad. I posted it, and, although its not as high as the original, I find it a much better article.

Well, this caught me off guard. It honestly did, to be frank. I did not expect that a series 1 slot would open, and, me being the loser fuck who stays up all night, took the spot after it was deleted. 

Despite it being my lowest rated article at the time of writing, it is probably my favorite. Maybe it was because I just loved GAW, or maybe it was the feeling of having contributed to something bigger than myself, I contributed to a list of "little Misters". 

After posting it and seeing my critcisms, I decided to rewrite the interviews so that they are not wooden and stiff as one comment pointed out.
