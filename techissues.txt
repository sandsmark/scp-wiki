title:Technical Issues
After getting quite a few technical issue notes attached straight to my personnel file, I've decided to update the servers with a tech issue file. Place a dated note or comment into the tech files and I will get to it __as soon as possible__. The previous notes have been moved from my personnel file to the page, and I encourage any returned notes to be placed as responses. Thank you.

**Note:** __01-08-09__ //But, I can't live without my underage pregnant red-haired Asian cheerleader in diapers and fur suits! Seriously, what good is a systems guy if he can't get even the simple porn working? Mhmm, I think I may have some work for you in 682s pen.// -Dr. Bright

> **Note:** //Okay, the necro and furry stuff is open. More later. Work must be done! -Pat//
