After getting quite a few technical issue notes attached straight to my personnel file, I've decided to update the servers with a tech issue file. Place a dated note or comment into the tech files and I will get to it __as soon as possible__. The previous notes have been moved from my personnel file to the page, and I encourage any returned notes to be placed as responses. Thank you.

**Note:** __01-08-09__ //Hey Pat, someone put some kind of net nanny thingy on the local system, and I can't get at my porn sites. Can you fix that up?// -Dr. Bright

> **Note:** //I can only unlock the beastiality, scat, and 'man vs. wild' ones, Doc. The rest are lost causes. -Pat//

**Note:** __01-08-09__ //But, I can't live without my underage pregnant red-haired Asian cheerleader in diapers and fur suits! Seriously, what good is a systems guy if he can't get even the simple porn working? Mhmm, I think I may have some work for you in 682s pen.// -Dr. Bright

> **Note:** //Okay, the necro and furry stuff is open. More later. Work must be done! -Pat//

**Note:** __01-09-09__ //Oh wow. That was harsh. Someone get Bright a new computer. In addition, I recommend that we nickname Mr. Gephart the "Bastard Operator From Hell."// - Clef

**Note:** __01-09-09__ //Who'd be the PFY then?// -Kulzn

**Note:** __01-10-09__ //Gep, I have an internal server error 571 while trying to contact the Foundation, gimme a scan for probable hackers and track their source locations ASAP!// -CarrionTrooper

> **Note:** //Internal Service Error 571? ... Am I reading this correctly? Five-seventy-one? ... ...//
> 
> 
> //Were you holding the device upside-down? -Pat//

**Note:** __01-10-09__ //Don't worry about Carrion, Pat. We taught him everything the wrong way, on purpose.  It was a slow day, and Clef and Kondraki bet me I couldn't do it. Okay, maybe they didn't bet me, maybe they inferred it. Okay, maybe I just decided to try it on my own, so what?// -Dr. Bright

> **Note:** //Bright, please at least ATTEMPT to date your inquiries and such. It makes it a lot easier on ME. Please. For me.//
> 
> //And you tried what on your own? An Internal Service Error 571 isn't a hacking error of any type, Bright... so... what did you actually do? -Pat//

**Note:** __01-10-09__ //Hey Pat, I do not hold my own laptop upside-down, and I am logging in from a secure location in Indonesia. How IS Dr. Bright able to do... whatever it is he did without hacking?// - CarrionTrooper

> **Note:** //A 571 is an error that shows when a message was unable to be sent at least four times. The only way Bright could've done anything is if he had canceled it from your terminal, or brought down an orbiting satteli-//
> 
> 
> //Oh god. **Bright!**//

**Note:** __01-11-09__ //Good news, Pat: the satellite burned out in re-entry and became quite the light show over Jakarta.  So no worries there.  Bad news is that since the Mumbai attacks, I've had to put the India servers in a semi-secure location.  Drop me a line on when we can transfer the DBs to a new system; I can't keep the darned things at Bollywood forever, contrary to popular opinion.// - Kamen

> **Note:** //I've transferred the data already. Destroy any database where the data had been kept with some form of explosives. I don't know how strong, go ckeck the rules. -Pat//

**Note:** __01-11-09__ //Pat, just for the record, don't approach a group of people playing a game, ask them to play when you don't know the actual rules of the game, then go all PMS when they're mean to you. Also, your charisma score is far too high for you to be playing DnD. And what's the best way of cleaning dolphin semen off of a keyboard?// -Agent Rapp

> **Note:** //Use canola oil. Unplug it before cleaning. Rinse with water, dry 24 hours in a warm room, fixed. -Pat//

**Note:**__01-11-09__ //Um, Pat? I was looking at some websites, and I clicked on a link that told me my IP address was being reported to the FBI. Since I was using the computer in my office, will I get in trouble if the FBI come knocking at Site 19's door? Please help. :(// - Trid

> **Note:** //Are you kidding? We're behind more than seven proxies. You'll be fine. -Pat//

**Note:** __01-11-09__ //So, Pat, a bunch of the printers at site 19 are down. Looks like someone hit them with a lamp. I think Dr. Rights might have found out where the calendars were being printed from. Any help?// -Dr. Bright

> **Note:** //Bright, you have to at least know how to send a requisition form. I'm not in charge of ordering new printers... not yet at least. -Pat//

**Note:** __01-12-09__ //Pat? Somebody's replaced every single SCP report I've written with photos of me, containing, lets say, "adult content". I wouldn't care so much except that some of them have my boyfriend in them and I'd like for the other researchers to stop calling him a girl. Please and thank you, Pat!// -Dr. Rights

> **Note:** //DOCTOR, I don't have clearance to edit your files. Plus, I don't blame them. I mean, seriously, haircuts are like eleven dollars. -Pat//

**Note:** __01-12-09__ //Hey Pat. Do you know how to make sure nobody's bugged my office phone? I need the line private so I can spend some quality time with Chris' voice...// -Dr. Rights

> **Note:** //As long as Bright hasn't bugged it in the last four hours. But let's be serious here: The chances he hasn't are slim. Perhaps you should invest in a cell. We could open it into the network. -Pat//

**Note:** __01-12-09__ //Gep, I keep getting calls by somebody searching for a 'Chris', and when I asked who's calling the line was dropped. Though insofar I have managed to trace it to site-19, and I'm guessing someone's playing with the phone system... And act quick, I bet the superiors are going to have a fit if they discover the international phone bill.// -CarrionTrooper

> **Note:** //I could block the number, but next time just play along. ;) -Pat//

**Note:** __01-12-09__ //Okay, what the **fuck**, where the hell did my bookmarks go? How am I supposed to make my daily quota of porn, violence, and schadenfreude now? Pat, get this under control or I'll assign you to debug Bright's computer. Yeah, __all__ the spyware.// -Dr. Kondraki

> **Note:** //Joke's on you, doctor. I got him a new computer as of Clef's orders, and put a sheriff card in it. He doesn't have the ability to get spyware on it. -Pat//

**Note:** __01-12-09__
//Mr. Gephart,//

//It appears that my login has been flagged again.  This has happened in the past, resulting from tampering by staff members.  I have been re-classed from “Researcher” to “SCP-217 Test Subject”.  While I understand the “joke” in regards to my particularities of emotional response, this is preventing me from accessing Central Records and numerous other databases.  While not vital in the immediate future, expedient resolution of this issue is requested.//

//In addition, please look into any measures that could be taken to prevent this in the future.  This is the eighth time in three months this has happened.//

//Dr. Gears//

> **Note:** //I am not able to change your classification until you can prove that you are not an SCP-217 test subject. Sorry, doctor. -Pat//

**Note:** __01-12-09__
//Pat,//

//Someone tried to log into my computer while I was gone and set off my customized positive action locks. Can you please order me a new box? Also, while you're at it, call housekeeping and tell them that there's another corpse that needs to be moved out of my office. Maybe they can ID it from dental records, if they can find the teeth.//

//Clef//

> **Note:** //Doctor, you're being rediculous. There's no such thing as a 'positive action' lock, and even if there was there'd be no way to customize it. Don't argue password protection with a hacker. And I'm not your personal pet, call your own damn housekeeping. -Pat//

**Note:** __01-12-09__
//Morning.
I've had one of my agents working with 425 for some time now and it seems the little bugger absolutely __loves__ to encrypt most anything digital.
This is great for some of the more sensitive documents, even using it on the files for 429... only problem is it seems that most of the other sites can't decrypt it with any modicum of success.//

//You seem like the sort of person to know about this stuff so I've uploaded a copy of "CYPHER C-429-K" in the hopes you can, ooh, I dunno, crack it and propogate it to the other sites? I don't think it'll affect anything still pending decryption but everything after that should come through cleanly.
Provided you do it right anyway... heh.// - Kulzn

> **Note:** //I can run it through some cypher cracking programs, and I can attempt to break it by hand but that'll take a while. I'll do my best, but I dunno what to tell you. -Pat//

**Note:** __01-12-09__
//Dimwit,//

//Did I say "positive action lock?" I'm sorry, I meant my foot up your fsking ass. Just order me a new damn computer already, and make sure there's enough room for me to put in a claymore mine.// - Clef

> **Note:** //Thank you for holding. Your call is very important to us. Please remain on the line, and your call will be answered in the order it was recieved. You are currently the... four... thousand... seven... hundred... sixty... second person in the queue. Please note: for quality assurance and training purposes, your call will be monitored and recorded.//

**Note:** __01-13-09__
//Paaaaat my scanner's not working again and I have no idea what wires got bumped this time. There's a fresh-baked Dutch Apple Pie for you if you can teach me how to plug the damn thing in correctly.// - Dr. Rights

> **Note:** //The wires were fine. The power box was a little wiggy on that particular plug, but I re-soldered the ground back up and it should be working now.//
> 
> //I expecially like how you bribed the diabetic with a dutch apple pie. -Pat// 

**Note:** __01-14-09__
//Diabetes? You should have [[[SCP-212|212]]] look at that. I hear having all your organs and blood replaced with biomechanical sacks will cure that right up. And what's the best way of getting horse semen off of a CRT monitor?//

> **Note:** //Thanks but no thanks.//
> 
> //Unplug, paint thinner, scrub, rinse, let dry 24 hours. -Pat//

**Note:** __02-06-09__
//Hey Pat, could you give me some of the files on how to crack the CIA database again? I forgot the part where the data access prevention program is to be shut... and it seems that a corrupted file's the only thing standing between me and this latest SCP info. Advice please?// -carriontrooper

> //That's not going to happen. The CIA database doesn't even HAVE SCP info, and if there were any corrupt files, I'd know. You don't have clearance to the CIA files, or it would be available to you.//
>
> //Stop trying to break my security measures. -Pat//

**Note:** __02-06-09__
//Pat- Seriously, just ignore Trooper. It's the easiest way. i mean, seriously, who cracks the CIA database? We've all got access codes. Well, all of us who need them anyways. What was I saying? Oh, yeah! My hard drive turned into a Muppet, can you get me a new one?// -Dr. Bright

> //Bright, if you keep doing this, eventually you're gonna be the one who gets screwed over. You just lost all your porn AGAIN, man. Isn't it getting boring, having to redownload it all constantly? Repairs completed, but damn, try to be careful? -Pat//

**Note:** __02-07-09__
//Boss,//

//While testing security protocols and checking the database's integrity, I got 24 Keter-Level Containment Breach notifications; and Marv IV lockdown procedures were triggered all over the fucking place. After three shots of vodka and the acquisition of a shotgun from the locker, I called to see if there was anybody alive and they told me that no containment breach ocurred nor any Mark IV or any other kind of Lockdown procedures were in place.//

//I can't find the reason of this security mismatch, my best bet is that somebody fucked with the codes as a little practical joke. However I'm not fully authorized to access the security protocols regarding Keter-Level security monitoring. Can you check who or what the hell triggered those bogus alarms?//

//-Pat Gibbons//

> //Ehhhhh, fuck. When you start messing with my programming... you see, I put little trip wires into the database, to make sure that anyone who was trying to fuck with it got locked in WITH it. You know, catch the intruders. You tripped the wire by trying to access a restricted file from a terminal that I specifically told NOT to allow access. Please only access files with Class 4 or higher security from your own private terminal, Doctor. -Pat//

**Note:** __02-08-09__

//Okay, dammit, I won't do it again. Promixe.//

//Anyways, server 35 is unaccessible; and all the troubleshooting I performed on it (Software and Hardware) gave no tangible results. I can't really say if the problem affects the entire Site, but I did check on three different terminals, all with the same results. Can you go check it out?//

//-Pat Gibbons//

> //Yeah, sure. I'll just go o-...//
> 
> //It's... it's gone. It's just... gone. Where did Server 35 go?//
> //I have a feeling Clef or Bright is behind this. Either one of them or the Janitor; that guy seems to know all the passwords before *I* even know them.//
>
> //Do we need to, like, set off security, Doctor?//

**Note:** __02-08-09__

//What. The. Fuck?//

//My computer just fuckin' EXPLODED. Well, the monitor anyway. I just barely avoided having a large overheated plastic piece embedded in my skull! Can you look into what the hell caused this and maybe recommend a replacement that is less at risk of a similar failure? Also how best to get blood off a keyboard and an external disk drive?//

//-Agent "Damn, that's gonna require stitches..." Thornton//

> //I have edited your file. We appologize for the inconvinence - your new recognized name is 'Damn-thats-gonna-require-stitches Thorton'. Someone didn't fill the 'First Name' box out. Weird.//
> 
> //Anyway, yeah, I can tell you exactly what happened. You were being stupid. How many things do you need plugged into that poor little Gateway? A fucking USB fan? Seriously? You have twenty high-stress-bearing outlets, and you have to have a normal cool-yourself-off fan plugged into your computer?//
>
> //I'm not getting you a replacement **ANYTHING** until you learn what a requirement is, and what a non-requirement is. Damnit.//

**Note:** __02-09-09__

//Hey, Pat. We have a joker here who is impersonating Agent Thornton and pretending that his  security pass labeled "Damn, that's gonna require stitches... Thornton" is genuine. Everything else checks out, except the name (honestly, as hilariously appropriate as it is, it is not exactly a bright choice... We're not Australian APEC security, dammit!), and the guy is getting increasingly threatening. I swear if this doesn't check off there's going to be an attempted break-in and the issue with self-resolve...//

//-Agent Moore, security//

> //I don't know how someone would get thier hands on an official pass labeled something so ironically truthful. I would figure you'd have some 'shoot to kill' rule on infiltrators. Hmm.//

**Note:** __02-13-09__

//Now first off this is entirely hypothetical, but what would you say was the best course of action for removing a sentient and bloody malicious program that started out as a simple cipher? And just for the hell of it let's pretend it's managed to make a little factory for itself and is cannibalising site materials to make strange and unseemly machines? I suggested fire but the others here aren't too keen on being burnt alive, the pussies. And if I can do it without unlocking the doors and going back inside, all the better. Purely hypothetical you understand, but you can see where I'm going with this.// - Agent Kulzn

> //Let's assume, for hypothetical purposes, that your cipher evolved into something that for some reason, is actually affecting the real world. Let's also assume that it actually wants to kill people, which is breaking the **first** rule of robotics.//
>
> //I would suggest taking whatever the program is on, and... well... formatting it? Permanently? Or incinerating it... or something... I'd incinerate the machines too, just to be sure.//

**Note:** __02-13-09__

//Hey Pat? How come the X-6711 satellite we put in orbit a few weeks ago isn't transmitting? I've checked with the guys over at the uplink, and no reply from there. Attached are the logs of last transmission. Most of it is Bright's porn, but look at lines 16 - 34, I'm not familiar with them... Find out what happened to the sat willya?// - carriontrooper

> //Uhhh... yeah. Sure.//
> //Constantly with the satellites, aren't you? I mean, they're worthless satellites. The only thing they're used for is recreational activities and porn and such. The field agents don't even use those satellites to transfer data, because they're not secure.//
>
> //Let me make this absolutely clear. **Stop worrying about the damned satellites.** I'm trying to create cameras to keep living statues from moving. I'm trying to keep twenty locations connected through an absolutely secure network. I've got more important things to do then sitting around worrying about unimportant satellites.//

**Note:** __02-15-09__

//Hey Pat, me again. My Winamp playlist has become psychically linked to my mood again, can you fix that? It's a little annoying when it picks mood music for me, even if it's useful for picking ominous music when I need to be wary. But it's getting a little annoying. After all, I don't need everybody to know what I'm actually thinking about. People get a little suspicious when "Get Ready To Die" starts playing every time they walk into my office.// - Dr. Rights

> //Yeah, sure, darling. I can look into it. I mean, I don't really know how you're doing this, but I guess I can try to do something with it... maybe some sort of TeleKill frame on it or something?//
> 
> //I do have to point out though, have you considered just... deleting "Get Ready to Die" from your computer?//

**Note:** __02-18-09__

//Hey Pat, hope you don't mind me borrowing a number of your servers and wireless equipment to set up my pirate radio station for Site 17. I'm sure you'll appreciate it in the long run, after all what's a more worthy endeavor than the entertainment of our personnel? On that note, I'm sure you'll be fine with taking part --of the-- blame when they crack down on it. Heck, I'll even give you a reserved slot so you can listen whenever you please(Hope you've got a taste for ambient breakcore with imbedded terror memes).// -Dr. Kondraki

> **Note:** http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxZJYbVd1hE -Pat

**Note:** __02-21-09__

//Two problems for you, Pat. Number one, my digital camera and wireless mouse seem to have come to life and are fighting to the death, and they attack me whenever I try to get close. I think the batteries I bought were possessed. How do I disable batteries from a distance without damaging the mouse or camera? And secondly, once they're disabled, how do I get  dog semen off of the lens of the camera?// -Agent Rapp

> **Note:** //Sorry. I accidently destroyed them. I was only trying to, you know, subdue them.//
> 
> //With a hammer.//
>
> //Guess you don't have to worry about the dog semen! -Pat//

**Note:** __03-03-09__

//Pat,//

//Some-fucking-how I managed to access Server No. 35 in Security Station Alpha, using the old Deutera access protocol. The files were corrupted, but the kicker is that the server is STILL gone. PHYSICALLY gone. As in, nothing there where Server 35 is supposed to be.//

//So tell me, what the fuck is going on? And more importantly, how do I remove the Deutera protocol and put back the current Tetarti one? If somebody knows I've been tampering with the security stations without doing that pile of paperwork, I might be elevated to Keter duty. And you don't want to know about the last time I voluntarily did Keter duty.//

//-Pat Gibbons//

> **Note:** //Heh.//
> 
> //You underestimate my speed and current workload, Doctor. I may have a thousand things on my list, but I managed to install a NEW Server 35 in a different location. Check Lab 4A6 and you'll find it. Also, the Deutera protocols only work **because you are a Doctor**, Doctor. I kept those up for the higher-ups. Lower levels can't access through it. But, if you're complaining, I'll take it off the higher accounts, as you wish. -Pat//

**Note:** __03-05-09__

//Mr. Gephart,//

//There was a minor security breach today in Lab 20, during testing with [[[SCP-457]]].  The situation is now contained, however there was extensive damage to both the Lab, and the adjoining secured server room.  The data was dumped to a emergency back-up system, however it is now partially encrypted and in a state of extreme disarray.//

//Please recover this data in as timely a manner as possible, and oversee the installation of a new server.  I would assign my assistant Iceberg to help, however he is currently processing paperwork for the incident, along with several hardware and authorization requests related to a personal project I am engaged in.//

//In addition, should you encounter any form of embers or flame while installing the new server, be advised these are most likely [[[SCP-457]]].  Immediately lock down the area, and attempt to avoid [[[SCP-457]]] until response teams arrive.//

//Dr. Gears//

> **Note:** //No, Doctor.//
> 
> //**Contain** SCP-457, and **then** I'll install a new server. Backup data is encrypted **by standard protocol** and is easy to access. I can run it somewhere else easily. I'm not, however, risking my ass to install a server (an eight hour job) in a room that could contain living fire. -Pat//

**Note:** __03-08-09__

//Pat,//

//I accidentally the whole Server 35//

//Love,//
//-Pat Gibbons//

> **Note:**
> //Not THE WHOLE SERVER! -Pat//

**Note:** __08-0Q-26__

//Hey there, son.//

//My computer won't make an internet. Do I have to right-click my desktop, or unzip my hard drives?//

//Thanks for the help, eh.//
//-Director Ghost//

> **Note:**
> //Internet? What is this 'internet' you speak of, Director? -Pat//

**Note:** __35-24-9001

//Dearest Mr. Gephart//

//If you're reading this, then you're pretty much fucked in the ass as it is.//

//Toodles,//

//SCP-317//

> //Fondest regards. - Pat//
**Note:** __3-16-09__

//Mr. Gephart? Me and the other research assistants have been having some problems whenever we try to access the// //Foundation network. We keep seeing "Error Code 18-Insufficient Security Clearance". There's no way that can be right,// //especially since even some of the D-class have been getting access, while we're still being denied! If you could fix this// //we'd appreciate it, especially since we need the network to collect our pay.//

//-Dr. Gerald//
