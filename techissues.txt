title:Technical Issues
After getting quite a few technical issue notes attached straight to my personnel file, I've decided to update the servers with a tech issue file. Place a dated note or comment into the tech files and I will get to it __as soon as possible__. The previous notes have been moved from my personnel file to the page, and I encourage any returned notes to be placed as responses. Thank you.

**Note:** __01-08-09__ //Hey Pat, someone put some kind of net nanny thingy on the local system, and I can't get at my porn sites. Can you fix that up?// -Dr. Bright

> **Note:** //I can only unlock the beastiality, scat, and 'man vs. wild' ones, Doc. The rest are lost causes. -Pat//

**Note:** __01-08-09__ //But, I can't live without my underage pregnant red-haired Asian cheerleader in diapers and fur suits! Seriously, what good is a systems guy if he can't get even the simple porn working? Mhmm, I think I may have some work for you in 682s pen.// -Dr. Bright

> **Note:** //Okay, the necro and furry stuff is open. More later. Work must be done! -Pat//

**Note:** __01-09-09__ //Oh wow. That was harsh. Someone get Bright a new computer. In addition, I recommend that we nickname Mr. Gephart the "Bastard Operator From Hell."// - Clef

**Note:** __01-09-09__ //Who'd be the PFY then?// -Kulzn

**Note:** __01-10-09__ //Gep, I have an internal server error 571 while trying to contact the Foundation, gimme a scan for probable hackers and track their source locations ASAP!// -CarrionTrooper

> **Note:** //Internal Service Error 571? ... Am I reading this correctly? Five-seventy-one? ... ...//
> 
> 
> //Were you holding the device upside-down? -Pat//

**Note:** ___01-10-09__ //Don't worry about Carrion, Pat. We taught him everything the wrong way, on purpose.  It was a slow day, and Clef and Kondraki bet me I couldn't do it. Okay, maybe they didn't bet me, maybe they inferred it. Okay, maybe I just decided to try it on my own, so what?// -Dr. Bright

> **Note:** //Bright, please at least ATTEMPT to date your inquiries and such. It makes it a lot easier on ME. Please. For me.//
> 
> //And you tried what on your own? An Internal Service Error 571 **literally means** the device was upside-down, Bright... so... what did you actually do? -Pat//
