After getting quite a few technical issue notes attached straight to my personnel file, I've decided to update the servers with a tech issue file. Place a dated note or comment into the tech files and I will get to it __as soon as possible__. The previous notes have been moved from my personnel file to the page, and I encourage any returned notes to be placed as responses. Thank you.

**Note:** __01-08-09__ //Hey Pat, someone put some kind of net nanny thingy on the local system, and I can't get at my porn sites. Can you fix that up?// -Dr. Bright

> **Note:** //I can only unlock the beastiality, scat, and 'man vs. wild' ones, Doc. The rest are lost causes. -Pat//

**Note:** __01-08-09__ //But, I can't live without my underage pregnant red-haired Asian cheerleader in diapers and fur suits! Seriously, what good is a systems guy if he can't get even the simple porn working? Mhmm, I think I may have some work for you in 682s pen.// -Dr. Bright

> **Note:** //Okay, the necro and furry stuff is open. More later. Work must be done! -Pat//

**Note:** __01-09-09__ //Oh wow. That was harsh. Someone get Bright a new computer. In addition, I recommend that we nickname Mr. Gephart the "Bastard Operator From Hell."// - Clef

**Note:** __01-09-09__ //Who'd be the PFY then?// -Kulzn

**Note:** __01-10-09__ //Gep, I have an internal server error 571 while trying to contact the Foundation, gimme a scan for probable hackers and track their source locations ASAP!// -CarrionTrooper

> **Note:** //Internal Service Error 571? ... Am I reading this correctly? Five-seventy-one? ... ...//
> 
> 
> //Were you holding the device upside-down? -Pat//

**Note:** __01-10-09__ //Don't worry about Carrion, Pat. We taught him everything the wrong way, on purpose.  It was a slow day, and Clef and Kondraki bet me I couldn't do it. Okay, maybe they didn't bet me, maybe they inferred it. Okay, maybe I just decided to try it on my own, so what?// -Dr. Bright

> **Note:** //Bright, please at least ATTEMPT to date your inquiries and such. It makes it a lot easier on ME. Please. For me.//
> 
> //And you tried what on your own? An Internal Service Error 571 isn't a hacking error of any type, Bright... so... what did you actually do? -Pat//

**Note:** __01-10-09__ //Hey Pat, I do not hold my own laptop upside-down, and I am logging in from a secure location in Indonesia. How IS Dr. Bright able to do... whatever it is he did without hacking?// - CarrionTrooper

> **Note:** //A 571 is an error that shows when a message was unable to be sent at least four times. The only way Bright could've done anything is if he had canceled it from your terminal, or brought down an orbiting satteli-//
> 
> 
> //Oh god. **Bright!**//

**Note:** __01-11-09__ //Good news, Pat: the satellite burned out in re-entry and became quite the light show over Jakarta.  So no worries there.  Bad news is that since the Mumbai attacks, I've had to put the India servers in a semi-secure location.  Drop me a line on when we can transfer the DBs to a new system; I can't keep the darned things at Bollywood forever, contrary to popular opinion.// - Kamen

> **Note:** //I've transferred the data already. Destroy any database where the data had been kept with some form of explosives. I don't know how strong, go ckeck the rules. -Pat//

**Note:** __01-11-09__ //Pat, just for the record, don't approach a group of people playing a game, ask them to play when you don't know the actual rules of the game, then go all PMS when they're mean to you. Also, your charisma score is far too high for you to be playing DnD. And what's the best way of cleaning dolphin semen off of a keyboard?// -Agent Rapp

> **Note:** //Use canola oil. Unplug it before cleaning. Rinse with water, dry 24 hours in a warm room, fixed. -Pat//

**Note:**__01-11-09__ //Um, Pat? I was looking at some websites, and I clicked on a link that told me my IP address was being reported to the FBI. Since I was using the computer in my office, will I get in trouble if the FBI come knocking at Site 19's door? Please help. :(// - Trid

> **Note:** //Are you kidding? We're behind more than seven proxies. You'll be fine. -Pat//

**Note:** __01-11-09__ //So, Pat, a bunch of the printers at site 19 are down. Looks like someone hit them with a lamp. I think Dr. Rights might have found out where the calendars were being printed from. Any help?// -Dr. Bright

> **Note:** //Bright, you have to at least know how to send a requisition form. I'm not in charge of ordering new printers... not yet at least. -Pat//

**Note:** __01-12-09__ //Pat? Somebody's replaced every single SCP report I've written with photos of me, containing, lets say, "adult content". I wouldn't care so much except that some of them have my boyfriend in them and I'd like for the other researchers to stop calling him a girl. Please and thank you, Pat!// -Dr. Rights

> **Note:** //DOCTOR, I don't have clearance to edit your files. Plus, I don't blame them. I mean, seriously, haircuts are like eleven dollars. -Pat//

**Note:** __01-12-09__ //Hey Pat. Do you know how to make sure nobody's bugged my office phone? I need the line private so I can spend some quality time with Chris' voice...// -Dr. Rights

> **Note:** //As long as Bright hasn't bugged it in the last four hours. But let's be serious here: The chances he hasn't are slim. Perhaps you should invest in a cell. We could open it into the network. -Pat//

**Note:** __01-12-09__ //Gep, I keep getting calls by somebody searching for a 'Chris', and when I asked who's calling the line was dropped. Though insofar I have managed to trace it to site-19, and I'm guessing someone's playing with the phone system... And act quick, I bet the superiors are going to have a fit if they discover the international phone bill.// -CarrionTrooper

> **Note:** //I could block the number, but next time just play along. ;) -Pat//

**Note:** __01-12-09__ //Okay, what the **fuck**, where the hell did my bookmarks go? How am I supposed to make my daily quota of porn, violence, and schadenfreude now? Pat, get this under control or I'll assign you to debug Bright's computer. Yeah, __all__ the spyware.// -Dr. Kondraki

> **Note:** //Joke's on you, doctor. I got him a new computer as of Clef's orders, and put a sheriff card in it. He doesn't have the ability to get spyware on it. -Pat//

**Note:** __01-12-09__
//Mr. Gephart,//

//It appears that my login has been flagged again.  This has happened in the past, resulting from tampering by staff members.  I have been re-classed from “Researcher” to “SCP-217 Test Subject”.  While I understand the “joke” in regards to my particularities of emotional response, this is preventing me from accessing Central Records and numerous other databases.  While not vital in the immediate future, expedient resolution of this issue is requested.//

//In addition, please look into any measures that could be taken to prevent this in the future.  This is the eighth time in three months this has happened.//

//Dr. Gears//

> **Note:** //I am not able to change your classification until you can prove that you are not an SCP-217 test subject. Sorry, doctor. -Pat//

**Note:** __01-12-09__
//Pat,//

//Someone tried to log into my computer while I was gone and set off my customized positive action locks. Can you please order me a new box? Also, while you're at it, call housekeeping and tell them that there's another corpse that needs to be moved out of my office. Maybe they can ID it from dental records, if they can find the teeth.//

//Clef//

> **Note:** //Doctor, you're being rediculous. There's no such thing as a 'positive action' lock, and even if there was there'd be no way to customize it. Don't argue password protection with a hacker. And I'm not your personal pet, call your own damn housekeeping. -Pat//

**Note:** __01-12-09__
//Morning.
I've had one of my agents working with 425 for some time now and it seems the little bugger absolutely __loves__ to encrypt most anything digital.
This is great for some of the more sensitive documents, even using it on the files for 429... only problem is it seems that most of the other sites can't decrypt it with any modicum of success.//

//You seem like the sort of person to know about this stuff so I've uploaded a copy of "CYPHER C-429-K" in the hopes you can, ooh, I dunno, crack it and propogate it to the other sites? I don't think it'll affect anything still pending decryption but everything after that should come through cleanly.
Provided you do it right anyway... heh.// - Kulzn

> **Note:** //I can run it through some cypher cracking programs, and I can attempt to break it by hand but that'll take a while. I'll do my best, but I dunno what to tell you. -Pat//

**Note:** __01-12-09__
//Dimwit,//

//Did I say "positive action lock?" I'm sorry, I meant my foot up your fsking ass. Just order me a new damn computer already, and make sure there's enough room for me to put in a claymore mine.// - Clef

> **Note:** //Thank you for holding. Your call is very important to us. Please remain on the line, and your call will be answered in the order it was recieved. You are currently the... four... thousand... seven... hundred... sixty... second person in the queue. Please note: for quality assurance and training purposes, your call will be monitored and recorded.//

**Note:** __01-13-09__
//Paaaaat my scanner's not working again and I have no idea what wires got bumped this time. There's a fresh-baked Dutch Apple Pie for you if you can teach me how to plug the damn thing in correctly.// - Dr. Rights

> **Note:** //The wires were fine. The power box was a little wiggy on that particular plug, but I re-soldered the ground back up and it should be working now.//
> 
> //I expecially like how you bribed the diabetic with a dutch apple pie. -Pat// 

**Note:** __01-14-09__
//Diabetes? You should have [[[SCP-212|212]]] look at that. I hear having all your organs and blood replaced with biomechanical sacks will cure that right up. And what's the best way of getting horse semen off of a CRT monitor?//

> **Note:** //Thanks but no thanks.//
> 
> //Unplug, paint thinner, scrub, rinse, let dry 24 hours.//
> 
> //Will someone please inform me on why Agent Rapp is addicted to animal semen?! -Pat//
