title:Technical Issues
After getting quite a few technical issue notes attached straight to my personnel file, I've decided to update the servers with a tech issue file. Place a dated note or comment into the tech files and I will get to it __as soon as possible__. The previous notes have been moved from my personnel file to the page, and I encourage any returned notes to be placed as responses. Thank you.

**Note:** __01-08-09__ //Hey Pat, someone put some kind of net nanny thingy on the local system, and I can't get at my porn sites. Can you fix that up?// -Dr. Bright

> **Note:** //I can only unlock the beastiality, scat, and 'man vs. wild' ones, Doc. The rest are lost causes. -Pat//

**Note:** __01-08-09__ //But, I can't live without my underage pregnant red-haired Asian cheerleader in diapers and fur suits! Seriously, what good is a systems guy if he can't get even the simple porn working? Mhmm, I think I may have some work for you in 682s pen.// -Dr. Bright

> **Note:** //Okay, the necro and furry stuff is open. More later. Work must be done! -Pat//

**Note:** __01-09-09__ //Oh wow. That was harsh. Someone get Bright a new computer. In addition, I recommend that we nickname Mr. Gephart the "Bastard Operator From Hell."// - Clef

**Note:** __01-09-09__ //Who'd be the PFY then?// -Kulzn

**Note:** __01-10-09__ //Gep, I have an internal server error 571 while trying to contact the Foundation, gimme a scan for probable hackers and track their source locations ASAP!// -CarrionTrooper

> **Note:** //Internal Service Error 571? ... Am I reading this correctly? Five-seventy-one? ... ...//
> 
> 
> //Were you holding the device upside-down? -Pat//

**Note:** __01-10-09__ //Don't worry about Carrion, Pat. We taught him everything the wrong way, on purpose.  It was a slow day, and Clef and Kondraki bet me I couldn't do it. Okay, maybe they didn't bet me, maybe they inferred it. Okay, maybe I just decided to try it on my own, so what?// -Dr. Bright

> **Note:** //Bright, please at least ATTEMPT to date your inquiries and such. It makes it a lot easier on ME. Please. For me.//
> 
> //And you tried what on your own? An Internal Service Error 571 isn't a hacking error of any type, Bright... so... what did you actually do? -Pat//

**Note:** __01-10-09__ //Hey Pat, I do not hold my own laptop upside-down, and I am logging in from a secure location in Indonesia. How IS Dr. Bright able to do... whatever it is he did without hacking?// - CarrionTrooper

> **Note:** //A 571 is an error that shows when a message was unable to be sent at least four times. The only way Bright could've done anything is if he had canceled it from your terminal, or brought down an orbiting satteli-//

**Note:** __01-11-09__ //Good news, Pat: the satellite burned out in re-entry and became quite the light show over Jakarta.  So no worries there.  Bad news is that since the Mumbai attacks, I've had to put the India servers in a semi-secure location.  Drop me a line on when we can transfer the DBs to a new system; I can't keep the darned things at Bollywood forever, contrary to popular opinion.// - Kamen

**Note:** __01-11-09__ //Pat, just for the record, don't approach a group of people playing a game, ask them to play when you don't know the actual rules of the game, then go all PMS when they're mean to you. Also, your charisma score is far too high for you to be playing DnD. And what's the best way of cleaning dolphin semen off of a keyboard?// -Agent Rapp

**Note:**__01-11-09__ //Um, Pat? I was looking at some websites, and I clicked on a link that told me my IP address was being reported to the FBI. Since I was using the computer in my office, will I get in trouble if the FBI come knocking at Site 19's door? Please help. :(// - Trid

**Note:** __01-11-09__ //So, Pat, a bunch of the printers at site 19 are down. Looks like someone hit them with a lamp. I think Dr. Rights might have found out where the calendars were being printed from. Any help?// -Dr. Bright

**Note:** __01-12-09__//Pat? Somebody's replaced every single SCP report I've written with photos of me, containing, lets say, "adult content". I wouldn't care so much except that some of them have my boyfriend in them and I'd like for the other researchers to stop calling him a girl. Please and thank you, Pat!// -Dr. Rights

**Note:**__01-12-09__//Hey Pat. Do you know how to make sure nobody's bugged my office phone? I need the line private so I can spend some quality time with Chris' voice...// -Dr. Rights

**Note:**__01-12-09__//Gep, I keep getting calls by somebody searching for a 'Chris', and when I asked who's calling the line was dropped. Though insofar I have managed to trace it to site-19, and I'm guessing someone's playing with the phone system... And act quick, I bet the superiors are going to have a fit if they discover the international phone bill.// -CarrionTrooper

**Note:**__01-12-09__//Okay, what the **fuck**, where the hell did my bookmarks go? How am I supposed to make my daily quota of porn, violence, and schadenfreude now? Pat, get this under control or I'll assign you to debug Bright's computer. Yeah, __all__ the spyware.// -Dr. Kondraki
