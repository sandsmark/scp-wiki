title:Technical Issues
**Note** _6-9-09_

I think I got Dr. Dumount's POS computer because whenever I boot it up, I see the image of people doing horrific things to animals, specifically pandas, and its really creeping me out. And because it's a peice of shit it boots up slowly so it takes all day to load. If you would be so kind as to wipe the harddrive I'd greatly appriciate it. I'm getting tired of working all of this through my PSP.
One more thing I'd like to ask? since when did you begin renting out robots for sex? I've heard rumors and I want to know how to get my hands on one, my fleshlight is getting kind of old.
thank you,
Bavil
