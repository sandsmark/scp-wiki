**Name:** S████ A███████

**Age:** Probably younger than you.

**Sex:** --Wizard-- Male

**Number of articles published:** Nah.

**Number of tales published:** About three.

**Lurker:** Yes, yes. Very much.

**Description:** Ekronak is a young male, approximately 5 feet and 10 inches tall, with tall bushy hair, a chubby body, and --super fucking smart-- --super shitting stupid-- --super dicking slow-- great at studying (--best you got?--). He can often be found either shutting himself indoors, having a great time outdoors, or watching "What If the Emperor Had a Text-To-Speech Device", because he loves all that Warhammer 40k shit. He writes and puts tales up on the wiki approximately every year, give or take, and has never, to date, gotten a successfully SCP draft or idea up. He isn't bitter (--he's totally bitter--) about any of that shit. Some people would hope that he finally puts up tales at a semi-regular basis (--what, the incredibly fast once-a-year schedule wasn't regular enough for you?--), but that hope is probably in vain.

+++ My Commentaries on Each One:

[[collapsible show="+ Another Lost Legacy" hide="- Please I wanna lose my legacy too"]]
The first one I successfully put up on the site after... how many failed attempts? I've tried to get many, **many** skips off the ground before this, and absolutely no tales. Then I finally got my first page up in one hour of writing and a few days of critiquing. In the form of my first tale draft. Goddamnit.

This one basically morphed from when I wanted to do exposition on a little concept from the Rat's Nest, and ended up with a little bit of gore and destruction tacked on in the end. Gotta be honest, still cringe when I read this, but ehhhhhhhhh...
