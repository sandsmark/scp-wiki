+++ My Commentaries on Each One:

[[collapsible show="+ Another Lost Legacy" hide="- Please I wanna lose my legacy too"]]
The first one I successfully put up on the site after... how many failed attempts? I've tried to get many, **many** skips off the ground before this, and absolutely no tales. Then I finally got my first page up in one hour of writing and a few days of critiquing. In the form of my first tale draft. Goddamnit.

This one basically morphed from when I wanted to do exposition on a little concept from the Rat's Nest, and ended up with a little bit of gore and destruction tacked on in the end. Gotta be honest, still cringe when I read this, but ehhhhhhhhh...
