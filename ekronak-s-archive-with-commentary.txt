**Name:** S████ A██████

**Age:** Probably younger than you.

**Sex:** --Wizard-- Male

**Number of articles published:** Nah.

**Number of tales published:** About twelve.

**Lurker:** Yes, yes. Very much.

**Description:** Ekronak is a young Filipino male, approximately 5 feet and 11 inches tall, with tall bushy hair. He can often be found either shutting himself indoors, having a great time outdoors, or watching "What If the Emperor Had a Text-To-Speech Device", because he loves all that Warhammer 40k shit. He writes and puts tales up on the wiki approximately every year, give or take, and has never, to date, gotten a successfully SCP draft or idea up. [He isn't bitter (--he's totally bitter--) about any of that shit.] Some people would hope that he finally puts up tales at a semi-regular basis (--what, the incredibly fast once-a-year schedule wasn't regular enough for you?--), but that hope is probably in vain.

**Update 6/12/2020:** Ekronak has shown to have had a long burst of activity starting from April 26, 2020 to June 12, 2020. During this period, the secretly multidimensional entity has been shown to interact with one particular universe previously unknown to Foundation personnel: Universe - 3-8-21-18-3-8, creating an astounding seven tale series in a two week time frame instead of the normal annual one tale turn-out. Doctor Shanos Agirenios has gone on record to comment on this, saying "He's finally gotten off his fucking ass for fucking once!"

+++ Another Lost Legacy

[[collapsible]] The first one I successfully put up on the site after... how many failed attempts? I've tried to get many, **many** skips off the ground before this, and absolutely no tales. Then I finally got my first page up in one hour of writing and a few days of critiquing. In the form of my first tale draft. Goddamnit.

This one basically morphed from when I wanted to do exposition on a little concept from the Rat's Nest, and ended up with a little bit of gore and destruction tacked on in the end. Gotta be honest, still cringe when I read this, but ehhhhhhhhh... [[/collapsible]]

+++ Dire Tidings

[[collapsible]] I built up to this one for days on end, not really solidifying my ideas in favor of mentally preparing myself for the creation of the story. Funnily enough, this story initially never had 239 in the first place- it was supposed to be a report on the state of the Doctors of the Church universe from the perspective of Alexylva! I must have spent a solid two hours working on the intro to that first concept, but after writer's block stymied any hope for me to get the actual story off the ground, I did another concept. What if we continue with the report concept, but take it from the perspective of a monk who's never had to deal with Alexylva? Then, I immediately took a U-turn, and thought "What if we just take out Alexylva completely?"

From there, I worked on the current concept for the tale, starting from a report by the (at-the-time unnamed) monk regarding a gigantic threat on the fringes of the Holy Foundation, then working from there. I first thought to make 3199 the all-encompassing threat, but rejected it when I remembered that I've already done something with them in Lost Legacy. I did a quick search of skips from series 1, and came up with two that I'd liked to include: 239, the witch, and 138, the catalyst character. Everything went fine until we hit the plot point of the witch's past and powers. Is she going to go super saiyan and rocket out of there to destroy the Foundation? Is she going to slowly remember her powers? Is she still held down by the spells? What of her backstory with Seth? Me spitballing the last half of the story isn't an exaggeration- I went ahead and did the first thing and then the second. The witch, I thought, was going to be powerful beyond belief. "Kum Ihug" was the corrupted Swedish word for remember, and I thought that Seth whispering it in her ear would be the one spell that would allow her to achieve full power. Then, she would rocket towards Arnven and destroy it, murdering every single Foundation Doctor that she came across.

But that was boring, and so I went back to the drawing board. In the end, I made it so that "Kum Ihug" would be the starting point for the witch's remembrance, but aside from a few fire spells, flying spells and healing spells, she wouldn't know a thing. When I went along with that plot point, I immediately got a hundred ideas at once for where I could take her character, and that's where I'm going in the next installment. Should be a fun ride, since this entire thing might just be five parts long exploring the stuff that the Witch and Jaelen get up to. [[/collapsible]]
