**Item #:** SCP-2391

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Video sharing websites are to be searched periodically by personnel for any evidence of videos uploaded by SCP-2391. During these searches, any videos uploaded by SCP-2391 or any accounts operated by SCP-2391 are to be removed immediately via agents operating from the parent companies. Any individuals determined to have watched a video uploaded by SCP-2391 a number of times that risks its effects taking hold are to be traced and dosed with Class B amnestics to remove the memories of their viewings.

In the event that an individual is determined to come under SCP-2391's effects to such a degree that amnestics would be ineffective are to be brought into custody immediately and kept in confinement until the effects have worn off. Upon release, they are to be dosed with a Class A amnestic. In the case that bringing said individual into custody is not possible, they are to be presented as a domestic terrorist to the public and prominent government figures in the area are to have their security increased.

**Description:** SCP-2391 is an entity which periodically creates accounts on and uploads videos to popular video sharing websites. These accounts, invariably named 'Bicameral Plays', upload footage of a young man, hereafter referred to as SCP-2391-1, playing various video games and speaking to the audience. The length of these videos are inconsistent; the earliest has been recorded as seven seconds while the longest has been recorded as two hours and twenty six minutes. 

SCP-2391-1 will generally display a casual and comedic demeanor, often making jokes regarding the contents of the games it plays. On occasion, however, SCP-2391-1 will display confusion or fear for short amounts of time, often questioning his current location or calling out to unseen individuals, most commonly a 'Miss Lenora'. SCP-2391-1 usually speaks English, but has been known to switch to Russian when vocalizing his distress.

Upon repeated viewings of videos uploaded by SCP-2391, individuals will begin to feel a sense of disillusionment with nearby authority figures, followed soon after[[footnote]] It is estimated to take at least two weeks for SCP-2391's effects to fully take hold. [[/footnote]] by a compulsive urge to assassinate prominent members of the United States government. Although this compulsion is out of affected individual's control, when questioned they will claim that any violent action was their own idea. Affected individuals will prioritize government figures that are immediately accessible to them, and in the event they cannot gain access to such figures they will instead attempt to perform suicidal attacks on government facilities.

Information regarding SCP-2391 was first obtained after the return of Site-09 to the Foundation by the Soviet government. (See Historical File 1991-B: 'The Arsenal.') Files recovered from Site-09 suggested experimentation had occurred in an effort to develop anomalous weapons for use in the event of war. Although files pertaining to the creation of the entity that became SCP-2391 were discovered (See Addendum 2391-2.), the project was believed to be a failure until the emergence of SCP-2391 on popular video sharing website YouTube in 20██.

**Addendum 2391-1 - Relevant Excerpts from Uploaded Videos:**

> **Uploaded Video Excerpt 227: 'Bicameral Plays: Runnerman' (Sixteen minutes and twenty two seconds.)**
> 
> (Standard SCP-2391 introduction featuring a logo[[footnote]] This logo is observed to change with each video.[[/footnote]] and seemingly random music[[footnote]] Music genres featuring in SCP-2391's introduction have included jazz, classical and folk music. [[/footnote]]. Cut to SCP-2391-1 sat at a desk, facing the camera. It appears to be in some form of study.[[footnote]] Video analysis has offered no clues as to the location featured in the video, and it is unknown if it has any basis in reality. [[/footnote]] SCP-2391-1 extends his palm towards the camera.)
> 
> **SCP-2391-1:** Hey again, guys, high five[[footnote]] 'Hey again, guys, high five' features at the beginning of most of the videos uploaded by SCP-2391, and thus seems to be a catchphrase. [[/footnote]]! (laughs) Bicameral here, and today we're going to be playing a little game called Runnerman! That's right - we all know Runnerman, and we all love Runnerman, ain't that right Runnerman? (high pitched voice, presumably an imitation of 'Runnerman') That's right Bicameral, you son of a bitch! (regular voice) What?!

> (SCP-2391-1 turns to look directly at the camera.)
> 
> **SCP-2391-1:** (monotone) Three eight point eight nine seven seven. Seven seven point zero three six five. Remember that - that's where the devil lives.
> 
> (A short pause, then SCP-2391-1 laughs.)
> 
> **SCP-2391-1:** I'm just messing with you guys.

> **Uploaded Video Excerpt 301: 'Bicameral Plays: Night of the Long Bald Doctor[[footnote]] This game is not mentioned in the video, and evidence suggests it does not actually exist. [[/footnote]] (One minute and fifty two seconds.)**
> 
> (No introduction. SCP-2391-1 is sat at his desk, appearing anxious. It waves at the camera and then extends a palm towards it.)
> 
> **SCP-2391-1:** Hey again, guys, high five! Just a little update video here. Find out the location of your local congressman, yeah? Recorded some crazy footage the other day - that'll be going up next week. That'll be going up next week. Is the war over, hello? Make sure to turn the safety off. I don't want to talk about that right now, okay? Make sure. Can you hear this, Miss Lenora?

> **Uploaded Video Excerpt 326: 'Unboxing' (Six minutes and nineteen seconds.)**

> (SCP-2391-1 is sat at his desk, head down, visibly crying.)
> 
> **SCP-2391-1:** Oh, sweet mother...Miss Lenora, I don't know which eyes are mine - which are they? Which one is me? I am cold and static. I - I don't want to do this anymore. I would like to be outside now. Hello?
> 
> (SCP-2391-1 looks up. There is no evidence of it having been crying. It extends a palm towards the camera.)
> 
> **SCP-2391-1:** Hey again guys, high five!
> 
> (Rest of the video consists of SCP-2391-1 opening an empty cardboard box over the course of five minutes.)

**Addendum 2391-2:**

> **Recovered Document 09-2391-1:**
> 
> 12/11/19██
> 
> ARSENAL PROJECT PROPOSAL "CONDON"
> 
> REQUIRED MATERIALS (ESTIMATE): Translation device recovered from November crash (FILE 99-A), remains of digital entity captured by Branch-C, volunteer from personnel for piloting purposes.
> 
> BRIEF PROPOSAL (SEE FILE 127-G[[footnote]] This file was not found in Site-09. [[/footnote]]): A media-based weapon capable of organizing sabotage and guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines in the event of war through mental reorganization. Weapon should be able to reorganize itself to suit the media of the time in the event of an extended war scenario. As an entity made from scratch may not hold loyalty towards it's creators, this researcher suggests the translation of a loyal individual to serve as a supervising force. Note there is a danger of mental degradation and integration of the entity and the supervisor in the event of an extended war scenario.
