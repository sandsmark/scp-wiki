**Item:** SCP-2391

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** All videos uploaded to SCP-2391 are to be saved to a secure hard-drive, then deleted from their original location. Comments on videos uploaded to SCP-2391 are to be logged before deletion of the video. In the event that a member of the public somehow manages to gain access to a video uploaded by SCP-2391 and spreads information about it, disinformation personnel are to spread the rumour that the video was simply recorded by Mr. McKay before his death, and uploaded automatically according to a schedule. 

**Description:** SCP-2391 is the YouTube account of popular entertainer Brian McKay, known on the website as 'Bimmy Plays', who was killed in a car crash in early 2013. Since Mr. McKay's death, SCP-2391 has continued to upload unlisted videos once a week featuring Mr. McKay. These videos are all exactly fifteen minutes long, and are all uploaded to the website at precisely 15:34 GMT[[footnote]] The time of Mr. McKay's death. [[/footnote]]. Attempts to trace who exactly is uploading these videos to SCP-2391 have thus far been unsuccessful.

Initially, the videos uploaded to SCP-2391 were not significantly different to those present before Mr. McKay's death, in that they would feature him playing a variety of video games while producing humorous commentary. On occasion, Mr. McKay would express confusion or distress for a few moments, but quickly dismiss it. As time has gone on, however, Mr McKay appears to have become more aware of his situation and will often spend the entire video requesting that the viewer contact the authorities on his behalf or provide other forms of assistance. Thus far, no method of communicating with Mr. McKay has been found.

Although all videos uploaded to SCP-2391 are unlisted, and can therefore only be accessed by those given the URL, they invariably receive thousands of views and comments. Most of these comments appear to be gibberish, but on occasion more legible comments have appeared, often professing an admiration for Mr. McKay and his web content. Attempts to trace the owners of the commenting accounts have also proven unsuccessful.

According to testimony given by Mr. McKay in videos uploaded to SCP-2391, he does not retain memories of the periods between videos. As such, researchers theorized that Mr. McKay is only actually aware for fifteen minutes each week, and that his consciousness no longer exists outside of his videos. All videos uploaded to SCP-2391 take place at night in Mr. McKay's bedroom[[footnote]] The version of Mr. McKay's bedroom which exists in reality has been investigated and found to have no anomalous properties. [[/footnote]], and according to Mr. McKay's testimony he is unable to leave that room.
