title:SCP-818-Script
**SCP-818-A: Script**

Times below are accurate within one minute of [[[SCP-818]]]'s schedule.  More detailed scripts (including number of footsteps taken and times recorded to within one tenth of a second) are available upon request to Dr. ████.  This script was slowly imposed on SCP-818 over a course of seven weeks by Agent ███████ and Dr. █████.  Any and all deviations must be noted to help in maintaining the efficacy of this containment procedure.

**8:43 A.M.** - SCP-818 awakes, walking northward from its bed to the wall. SCP-818 will then walk the circumference of its wall eight times, then continue for an additional walk until reaching the exact southern point of the room.

**9:11 A.M.** - SCP-818 will face the southern wall.

**9:51 A.M.** - SCP-818 will turn abruptly and walk to the middle of the room.  It will then stare at the ceiling light.  **SCP-818 MUST NOT BE DISTURBED DURING THIS PERIOD UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES** //See Incident Report SCP-818-3Z//

**10:38 A.M.** - SCP-818 will return to its bed and stare at the North-West curve of the wall.  Floating color based images can be observed at this point.  

**11:41 A.M.** - SCP-818 will get up and walk to the table, kneeling at it.  For the duration, SCP-818 can be approached.  SCP-818 should not be spoken to during this time.

**12:58 P.M.** - SCP-818 will stand and proceed to the eastern most wall. It will then follow the circumference of the wall sixteen times.

**1:43 P.M.** - SCP-818 will suddenly turn sharply, return to table quickly, sitting and kneeling again. 

**3:00 P.M.** - SCP-818 will begin to cry soundlessly.  **SCP-818 MUST NOT BE DISTURBED DURING THIS PERIOD UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES**

**3:43 P.M.** - SCP-818 will return to its bed and lay down, opening and closing its eyes.  

**4:15 P.M.** - SCP-818 will leave its bed and return again to the table.  --It is safe to approach SCP-818 at this time.  SCP-818 should not be spoken to during this time.-- //SCP-818 should not be approached at this time.  See Report SCP-818-7N and additional termination report of D-1922.//

**5:30 P.M.** - SCP-818 will enter its dangerous phase.  For the duration of this stage, it will exercise its abilities, changing colors, randomly generating objects, and running about the room.  Dr. ████████ seems to believe that this is some kind of "tantrum" that SCP-818 used to throw everyday.  Regardless, this is the one period of time that constant, vigilant observation must be made.

**5:38 P.M.** - SCP-818 ceases its tantrum and will lay on its bed, apparently crying again.

**5:47 P.M.** - SCP-818 will get up from its bed and walk to the northern most point of the room.  It will then cross to the southernmost point and back again.  From this point until it enters its passive state, SCP-818's behaviors are more erratic, with a few exceptions noted below.  Agent ███████ and Dr. █████ were unable to modify this section of SCP-818's behavior beyond a few points, including:

Between **6:00 P.M.** and **6:45 P.M.** - SCP-818 will scream and hit the surface of the table.

Between **6:30 P.M.** and **8:00 P.M.** - SCP-818 will manifest an object of some sort.  Generally, this object appears to be a misshapen clump of dirt, wood, or metal.  No analysis has been attempted due to SCP-818's unpredictable nature during this period.

Between **7:00 P.M.** and **8:00 P.M.** - SCP-818 will cease breathing and fall to the floor for approximately seven minutes.

Between **6:00 P.M.** and **9:15 P.M.** - SCP-818 will manifest a number of small objects, and proceed to arrange them in size from largest to smallest.  Occasionally, SCP-818's innate abilities will manifest, causing the objects to shift in size, leading to extreme agitation and anger as they no longer follow the pattern.  If the objects fail to stabilize, execute protocol █████, and immediately notify Dr. ██████.

**9:21 P.M.** - SCP-818 will return to its bed, laying down, closing its eyes, and entering a passive state.
