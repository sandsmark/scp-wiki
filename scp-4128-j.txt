**Item:** SCP-4128-J
 
**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4128-J should be secured in a standard Low Threat storage unit when not in use. Interaction is limited to four hours per day per researcher. 

**Description:** SCP-4128-J is a hive mind collective consisting of 3 //levothyroxin// tablets and 3 //cetirizine hydrochloride// tablets. These are currently housed in a mundane pharmaceutical pill bottle. 

When emptied onto a flat surface, SCP-4128-J is capable of rudimentary visual communication through assisted self-configuration. It displays both an understanding of basic human concepts and a persistent memory of previous communications.  

More than eight hour's exposure per day may cause memetic effects mimicking mutual affection and interpersonal bonding. Whilst SCP-4128-J is non-hostile, these effects are cumulative and may result in staff divulging unsanitized, sensitive or otherwise inappropriate information. In such cases, standard re-assignment applies.

**Test #15,321** //(Unofficial, unscheduled. Full test protocols not applied).//

* Please Note: Procedure A consists of the researcher waiting five seconds, collecting up the SCP-4128-J instances, putting them into their container, shaking them, then emptying them out into a green receptacle.

**Researcher Gwent:** Sorry. Didn't mean to shake you so hard. Hope I didn't wake you... Just came by to say it's Christmas Day. It's Christmas Day and I'm locked up //here.//

**Researcher Gwent:** Don't give me the cold shoulder treatment. I didn't mean to be insensitive; I meant we're //both// locked up here. Sorry - I'm not myself. You may have already heard but I've been reassigned to other duties with immediate effect. They think we're getting too "pally."

**Researcher Gwent:** I'm sorry. I'm needed elsewhere. Dangerous research that only I can handle. That [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4694 multi-dimensional pyramid scheme].

**Researcher Gwent:** Sorry, sorry. Just trying to lighten the mood.
Seeing how it's Christmas Day, and I'm here sitting in a cold white research chamber, whilst everyone else has gone home... maybe something festive?  Maybe Santa?

**Researcher Gwent:** That makes me feel happy and sad at the same time.  Well... I guess that's that. I only popped by to say a final farewell. I probably won't see you again, but I just want you to know it's been a privilege to get to know you. We've had some times together, haven't we? Goodbye, SCP-4128-J. Goodbye.

//Researcher Gwent waits five seconds, collects up the SCP-4128-J instances and puts them back into their container. He appears to be distracted and in a state of sadness. He neglects to secure the container and instead places it onto a coaster. He then proceeds to exit the research chamber after glancing back at SCP-4128-J's container.//

//The following is picked up by motion-sensitive cameras: the chamber door closes and this causes the container to slip off the coaster. The contents spill into the green receptacle. See Final Communication.//
