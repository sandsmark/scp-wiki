**Item #:** SCP-939-J

**Object Class:** Thaumiel

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-939-J is housed in a standard canine containment cell in Site-20. As SCP-939-J has paradoxically demonstrated a simultaneous absolute loyalty to deontological morality and the operations of the Foundation, SCP-939-J is allowed free reign throughout the facility with the accompaniment of Agent Wu.[[footnote]] Previous agents assigned to SCP-939-J include agents Smith, Rosencrantz (Deceased), Thornfield, Rogers, and Guildenstern (Deceased).[[/footnote]]  In the event of any unexplained criminal happenings[[footnote]] Colloquially referred to as "mysteries". [[/footnote]] SCP-939-J is authorized to take the role of lead investigator. Security personnel are to be briefed on this protocol and on SCP-939-J's anomalous properties.

**Description:** SCP-939-J is a 50-kilogram German Shepard. SCP-939-J's anomalous properties are as follows:

* Ability to speak English.

* Inability to do anything perceived as morally dubious.

* Ability to determine the perpetrator of 93% of criminal acts occurring within a 100-meter radius.

* 93% increase in the number of criminal acts detected within a 100-meter radius.[[footnote]] Thought to be a result of SCP-939-J being able to detect acts that would have otherwise gone unnoticed as opposed to any anomalous increase in crimes. [[/footnote]]
