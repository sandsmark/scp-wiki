Security Level:  Two
Assignment:  Nutritionist, Humanoid containment and Researcher (Culinary)

Mister Flames seems only mildly eccentric compared to others at Site-17, but do not be fooled.  His culinary attempts at "weapons-grade" chili have been stymied by the lack of invulnerable Crock Pots™, but that does not prevent him from trying.  Fortunately, Mister Flames restricts his research to his laboratory, and maintains the strict dietary needs of those under his care. 

**Contained:**

[[[scp-130 |SCP-130:  Post Office]]]
[[[scp-199 |SCP-199:  Ferns]]]
[[[scp-394 |SCP-394:  Ear Candles]]]
[[[scp-852 |SCP-852:  Lunar Anomaly]]]
[[[scp-937 |SCP-937:  Walking Sticks]]]

Also has provided assistance with [[[SCP-628]]] and [[[SCP-799]]], and is an admirer of [[[photosynthetics-personnel-file |Dr. "Photosynthetic's"]]] work.  Attempts to bribe her to assist with an 'improved' //Capsicum frutescens// cultivar are ongoing.

//I'd be happy to work with you if you weren't asking for peppers with enough capsaicin to cause second-degree chemical burns on contact. I offered to help build a better// Capsicum, //not engineer a biological weapon.// -- Photosynthetic

//Dammit, and I just managed to get a ceramic pot that could handle it.  And it's not like I want only capsaicin, for that matter.  Flavor matters!//  -- Flames
