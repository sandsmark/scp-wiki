**Item #:** SCP-2860

**Object Class:** Euclid (Formerly Safe)

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2860 is to be contained within a Type S Standard Humanoid Anomaly Containment Cell at Site-19. In addition to standard furnishings, the contents of SCP-2860’s former office have been moved into its cell. Medical assistance is to be provided upon request and psychological health screenings are to be performed every two weeks. Prior to any interaction with living organic material, SCP-2860 is to be required to wear specially treated leather gloves so as to limit risk of accidental exposure of personnel to SCP-2860’s effect.

**Update (06/09/2014):** Due to increased sensitivity of SCP-2860’s effect to include the entirety of the object’s body, prior to any interaction or transport, SCP-2860 is to be required to wear a modified isolation suit so as to prevent any further exposure of personnel to SCP-2860’s effect. This isolation suit is to be replaced after each individual use. Due to the increased risk of performing psychological health screenings, such screenings have been reduced to once per month.

**Update (07/11/2016):** Due to increased sensitivity of SCP-2860’s effect to include any skin cells or hair shed by the object, SCP-2860 is to be contained within a sealed humanoid containment cell with an independent filtration system.  This cell is to be cleaned of any particulates shed by SCP-2860 every two weeks by personnel equipped with Class-B hazmat suits. Prior to this cleaning, SCP-2860 is to be moved to a specialized decontamination chamber for removal of any remaining particulates. Skin cells and hair collected in this matter are to be incinerated on-site. Psychological health screenings are to be performed via teleconference on a weekly basis to monitor SCP-2860’s declining mental state.

**Description:** SCP-2860 is the former Dr. Harold Thompson, a 46-year-old, Caucasian male. Prior to containment, SCP-2860 served a total of ten years as a Level 2 Researcher of Site-19’s Experimental SCP Object Cataloging Lab. During this initial time period, SCP-2860 did not display any anomalous properties.

SCP-2860’s effect manifests when any living organic material comes into direct physical contact with its hands. Any such contact results in the instantaneous transformation of the organic material into solid marble. Analysis of material transformed in this fashion shows that materials covering the tested material, or inorganic components of the material (osseous tissue, etc.) are not affected by SCP-2860’s effect. The degree of sensitivity of this ability seems to extend down to a microscopic level, as individual microscopic organisms present on SCP-2860’s skin appear to undergo transformation upon exposure. This results in a very fine marble powder forming on SCP-2860’s ungloved hands after a few seconds of exposure. 

SCP-2860’s effect first manifested on 17/10/2004, following accidental exposure of Dr. Harold Thompson to a particulate released from an experimental anomalous object acquired from a raid on an anart studio near Portland, OR. This object was a hollow steel rod with a brass tip that had the same effect as SCP-2860. The rod was engraved with “# 5” on its side. Exactly how Dr. Thompson affected the release of the particulate from the rod, or what its exact composition was, is currently unknown due to its immediate disappearance after release. The rod lost its anomalous effects upon release of the particulate. Investigation as to whether more instances of this object are currently at large is ongoing.
 
**Addendum: 2860-1: Interview Log  2860-1** 

> //The following interview was conducted following SCP-2860’s initial containment.//
> 
> **Interviewed: SCP-2860**
> 
> **Interviewer: Dr. Freemont**
> 
> **Foreword:** This interview was done following an initial screening of SCP-2860’s anomalous properties.
> 
> **<Begin Log>**
> 
> **Dr. Freemont:** Good afternoon, Harold.
> 
> **SCP-2860:** Afternoon Melissa. I have to say this is really weird.  I never really imagined what it was like to be on the other side of what we do here… I can’t say I’m too fond of it.
> 
> **Dr. Freemont:** You of all people should know that if you cooperate with us fully everything should work out fine. Now, I have a few questions about that round of testing we just did…
> 
> **SCP-2860:** Fire away.
> 
> **Dr. Freemont:** Earlier we had you transform various small animals into marble. This event is automatic, correct?
> 
> **SCP-2860:** Yeah. I don’t think I have any control of it. It just… happens.
> 
> **Dr. Freemont:** Do you feel anything?
> 
> **SCP-2860:** I do. It’s kind of like the feeling of a small static discharge. Each time I touched one of those animals, it’d go off, and the poor thing would be made of stone. Same goes for whatever is living on my hands. Its… rather uncomfortable.
> 
> **Dr. Freemont:**  Interesting, and you say this happens every time?
> 
> **SCP-2860:** Yeah. Every time...

**Addendum: 2860-2: Update** As of 06/09/2014, SCP-2860’s effect has increased in sensitivity from direct physical contact with its hands to direct physical contact anywhere on its body. As a result, the subject is almost constantly covered with a fine marble powder on all exposed areas. SCP-2860 claims this constant use of its effect causes it continuous discomfort, and as a result has made SCP-2860 increasingly irritable. An isolation suit has been provided to provide relief. Special Containment Procedures have been updated to reflect this change. Object class has been upgraded to Euclid.

**Addendum: 2860-3: Update** As of 07/11/2016, SCP-2860’s effect has increased in sensitivity to not only include direct physical contact with any hair or skin cells shed by the object, but also transforms all organic matter, living or dead. Skin cells and hair seem to maintain SCP-2860’s effect indefinitely and as a result SCP-2860 claims to be in a state of extreme discomfort. At the time of writing, SCP-2860 is unable to sleep without sedation, and must be fed intravenously due to food undergoing transformation during all attempts of SCP-2860 to feed itself. At the current time, SCP-2860’s internal tissue does not appear to present with the same anomalous properties. 

Repeated inhalation of the marble dust generated by SCP-2860’s effect has resulted in dust deposits forming within SCP-2860’s lungs. These deposits have resulted in accelerated silicosis and progressive massive fibrosis. The nearly constant buildup of marble dust along SCP-2860’s eyes has resulted is severe abrasions to the object’s corneas, resulting in SCP-2860 becoming largely blind in both eyes. Medical treatment to alleviate these conditions is currently ongoing.  As a result of these conditions and the constant use of its effect, SCP-2860 has become mentally unstable. Special Containment Procedures have been updated to reflect this change.

**Addendum: 2860-4: Interview Log  2860-2**

> //The following interview was conducted following a standard mental health screening on 17/12/2016.//
> 
> **Interviewed: SCP-2860**
> 
> **Interviewer: Dr. Cassidy**
> 
> **Foreword:** This interview was done by SCP-2860’s request following a standard mental health screening conducted via telecast. Due to SCP-2860's progressive massive fibrosis, the object experienced shortness of breath throughout the interview's duration.

> 
> **Dr. Cassidy:** Good afternoon, SCP-2860, what is it you wished to speak about.
> 
> **SCP-2860:** For the love... of god… Drake. Please, for the sake of my sanity… call me Harold.
> 
> **Dr. Cassidy:** I’m sorry. What is it you wish for to speak with me about, Harold?
> 
> **SCP-2860:** Please… kill me…
> 
> **Dr. Cassidy:** I’m sorry… what?
> 
> **SCP-2860:** I’m falling apart Drake. I can’t eat… I can’t sleep… I feel like there is… a swarm of... fire ants living in my skin! I can’t go on… If you have any mercy… in you… put on a goddamn hazmat suit… grab a gun… and shoot me… in the fucking head! Please…
> 
> **Dr. Cassidy:** Harold… You of all people know I can’t do that.
> 
> //SCP-2860 violently coughs for several minutes.//
> 
> **SCP-2860:** Then... get the fucking… ethics committee to sign off on it… Have the O5’s give you… a smiley face… sticker… Just, please… I can’t do this… this is just… cruel…
> 
> **Dr. Cassidy:** I’m sorry, Harold. I can’t do that.
