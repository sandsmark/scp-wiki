**Item:** SCP-272

**Class:** Safe

**Containment Procedures:** SCP-272 is to be contained in a small wooden box in a vault at Sector-25. Apart from this, no further containment is necessary, as the object is completely inert when not in use. Care is to be taken not to drop the item during transit.

**Description:** SCP-272 is an iron nail, approximately 11.5 cm long, resembling ancient designs. Covering every flat surface there are engravings of unknown historical placement, but the overall feeling one gets from viewing them has been described as “captivating, if a little scary”. The nature of the object becomes apparent when it is dropped onto the shadow of an individual. When this happens, the nail will bury itself exactly 2/3 of its length into the material the shadow is cast on. From this point on, two effects should be noted: The person whom the shadow belongs to will not be able to remove the nail, by any means, and they are limited to movements that keep their shadow cast on the nail. The nail, however, may be removed by conventional means by anyone else; though it has been reported that they feel a mild aversion to doing so, reporting that “it feels fair”. The object was discovered during a routine sweep embedded into an exposed rock face near an abandoned air force base in █████, Afghanistan with a human skeleton scattered around it. It was thought to be mundane until a researcher dropped it at their feet, and was subsequently pinned to the spot for 20 minutes before being assisted. When questioned about the incident later about why they didn’t help sooner, most simply shrugged.

**Experiment log:**

(Please give test subject, surface material, lighting and any other variables.)

> **272-a:**
> __Test subject:__ 1 D-Class personnel (D-272-01)
> __Surface:__ Rock face at discovery site
> __Lighting:__ Midday sun (directly overhead)
> __Additional:__ None
> Procedure: Subject was handed the nail and told to hammer it into his shadow at his feet. Subject complied. Once the nail had reached the 2/3 mark, subject could drive it in no further. Subject then made an attempt to move away but was unable to. Subject soon become fatigued and succumbed to heatstroke. Object removed, subject given medical treatment.

> **272-b:**
> __Test subject:__ 1 D-Class personnel (D-272-02)
> __Surface:__ Same as above
> __Lighting:__ Night (Minimal)
> __Additional:__ None
> __Procedure:__ Nail was dropped at the subject’s feet and embedded itself exactly 2/3 of the way in. Subject then asked to move 10 m away from the nail; subject complies showing no adverse effects. Subject then attempts to escape and is terminated. Object recovered.

> **272-c:**
> __Test subject:__ 1 D-Class personnel (D-272-03)
> __Surface:__ Same as above
> __Lighting:__ Same as above
> __Additional:__ Test time 2 hours before sunrise.
> __Procedure:__ Nail dropped as above. Subject told to walk in a straight line away from the nail. Subject shows no adverse effects. At 6:06 local time the sun rose and subject was [DATA EXPUNGED]. Three clean-up teams dispatched. Subject’s torso recovered 106 m from object; shows signs of severe road rash. Object recovered. Testing moved to Sector-25.
