**Item:** SCP-272

**Class:** Safe

**Containment Procedures:** SCP-272 is to be contained in a small wooden box in a vault at Sector-25. Apart from this, no further containment is necessary, as the object is completely inert when not in use. Care is to be taken not to drop the item during transit.

**Description:** SCP-272 is an iron nail, approximately 11.5 cm long, resembling ancient designs. Covering every flat surface there are engravings of unknown historical placement. The engravings have been described as “captivating, but scary” in a majority of staff interviewed. The nature of the object becomes apparent when it is dropped onto the shadow of an individual. The nail will bury itself exactly 2/3 of its length into the material the shadow is cast on. Following this, two effects should be noted: The person whom the shadow belongs to will not be able to remove the nail, by any means, and they are limited to movements that keep their shadow cast on the nail. The nail, however, may be removed by conventional means by anyone else; noting that reports indicate a mild aversion to doing so, citing claims that “it feels fair”. 
The object was discovered during a routine sweep embedded into an exposed rock face near an abandoned air force base in █████, Afghanistan with a human skeleton scattered around it. It was thought to be mundane until a researcher dropped it at their feet, and was subsequently pinned to the spot for 20 minutes before being assisted.

**Experiment log:**

(Please give test subject, surface material, lighting and any other variables.)

> **272-a:**
> __Test subject:__ 1 D-Class personnel (D-272-01)
> __Surface:__ Rock face at discovery site
> __Lighting:__ Midday sun (directly overhead)
> __Purpose:__ Establish nature of SCP.
> __Procedure:__ Subject was handed the nail and told to hammer it into his shadow at his feet. 
>__Results:__ Subject complied. Once the nail had reached the 2/3 mark, subject could not continue. Subject then attempts to move away but was unable to. Subject soon becomes fatigued and succumbs to heatstroke. Object removed, subject given medical treatment.
>__Conclusions:__ Nature of the object established.

> **272-b:**
> __Test subject:__ 1 D-Class personnel (D-272-02)
> __Surface:__ As above
> __Lighting:__ Night (Minimal)
> __Purpose:__ Establish effects at night.
> __Procedure:__ Nail was dropped at the subject’s feet and embedded itself exactly 2/3 of the way in. Subject then asked to move 10 m away from the nail. 
>__Results:__ Subject complies showing no adverse effects. Subject then attempts to escape and is terminated. Object recovered.
>__Conclusions:__ Subjects is free to move when no shadow is cast.

> **272-c:**
> __Test subject:__ 1 D-Class personnel (D-272-03)
> __Surface:__ As above
> __Lighting:__ As above; 2 hours before sunrise
> __Purpose:__ Establish effects of lighting changes.
>__Procedure:__ Nail dropped as above. Subject told to walk in a straight line away from the nail.
>__Results:__  Subject shows no adverse effects. Sunrise occurred at 6:06 local time and subject was [DATA EXPUNGED]. Three clean-up teams dispatched. Subject’s torso recovered 106 m from object; shows signs of severe road rash. Object recovered. Testing moved to Sector-25.
>__Conclusions:__ [DATA EXPUNGED].

>**272-d:**
>__Test subject: 1 D-Class personnel (D-272-04)
>__Surface:__ Concrete floor of test facility 25-h
>__Lighting:__ 1 standard (60 w) light bulb, directly overhead
>__Purpose:__ Establish lighting requirements.
>__Procedure:__ Nail dropped on the shadow of test subject. Subjects told to walk in a straight line away from the object.
>__Results:__ Object embedded. Subject was free to move. Object recovered.
>__Conclusions:__ Insufficient lighting will cause no effect.

>**272-e:**
>__Test subject: 1 D-Class personnel (D-272-04)
>__Surface:__ As above
>__Lighting:__ 1 standard (1,500 W) stadium light, directly overhead
>__Purpose:__ As above.
>__Procedure:__ As above.
>__Results:__ Object embedded. Subject trapped. Object recovered.
>__Conclusions:__ Lighting requirements established. 
>
>__Addendum:__ For future note, when testing with ultra-high output lamps, it is advisable __not to look directly into the light__. – Dr. Kimiro

>**272-f:**
>__Test subject:__ 2 D-Class (D-272-04 and D-272-05)
>__Surface:__ As above
>__Lighting:__ 2 stadium lights, positioned 90° apart
>__Purpose:__ Determine if multiple subjects can be held.
>__Procedure:__ Subjects positioned so their shadows overlap. Object dropped onto both shadows. Subjects told to advance away from the nail.
>__Results:__ Object embedded. Subject D-272-04 continues unhindered, but reports feeling a ‘chill’, D-272-05 is held by the object. Object recovered.
>__Conclusions:__ Object cannot hold more than one subject. Potential mild memetic effect observed.
