**Item #:** SCP-3261

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3261-1 and all instances of SCP-3261-2 to be stored in a secure containment locker in the E wing of Site-64. SCP-3261-2 instances are only to be removed from the locker for testing purposes.

**Description:** SCP-3261-1 is a 17-stringed koto made from //Paulownia tomentosa// wood measuring 182 centimeters in length. The ryūgaku is decorated with a floral pattern, while the ryūzetsu depicts a small village and is engraved with the kanji "樺岡[[footnote]]Translates to "birch tree hill."[[/footnote]]". SCP-3261-2 is the collective designation for 12 pieces of sheet music for koto written in Yamada school notation.

When an instance of SCP-3261-2 is viewed, the viewer will begin to search for SCP-3261-1. The degree of this compulsion varies depending on the instance viewed.  Copies of SCP-3261-2 do not preserve this anomalous effect.

When the viewer finds SCP-3261-1, they will begin to use it to play the SCP-3261-2 instance viewed. The SCP-3261-2 instance will be played within an error margin of 0.7%. If play is interrupted, the player will become distressed and attempt to resume by any means possible.

The player and all listeners will begin to perceive a scene dependent on the instance of SCP-3261-2 selected. The player and listeners can interact with people and objects within this scene, collectively designated as SCP-3261-3, although these objects are not visible to non-listeners. When SCP-3261-2 ends, the player and listeners will become unconscious for approximately 15 minutes. Selected SCP-3261-2 instances are listed below:

|| Instance || Title || Scene || Notes ||
|| SCP-3261-2a || 村人の子守唄 (Villager's Lullaby) || A small village with late Meiji era architecture at dusk. At the beginning of the third line, a man exits a house carrying a wooden bucket. The man collects water from a well in the center of the village. During the seventh line, he re-enters the house. || Thought to be the village depicted on the ryūzetsu of SCP-3261-1. Lyrics are similar to a typical lullaby. ||
|| SCP-3261-2c || 小瑠璃 (Siberian Blue Robins) || Two young boys watching a pair of Siberian blue robins in a cherry tree. The robins' vocalizations align with the rhythm of the song. || Song consists of three stanzas, each of which is a tanka. Lyrics describe the robins in a manner typical of Japanese poetry. ||
|| SCP-3261-2d || 君が代 (Kimigayo) || The coronation ceremony of Emperor Meiji. No deviations from the original event have been observed. || Song was composed in 1880 and became the national anthem in 1888, although Meiji was coronated in 1868. ||
|| SCP-3261-2g || Unknown || A village identical to that appearing in SCP-3261-2a at noon. SCP-3261-3g1, a man in 1970s clothing, can be seen frantically searching for an unknown object. || No lyrics. See notes on SCP-3261-2a. Page is partially illegible due to water damage. SCP-3261-3g1 is thought to be searching for SCP-3261-1. ||
|| SCP-3261-2j || 私の親愛なる小春専用 (Dedicated to My Dear Koharu) || A young couple walking through a village identical to that appearing in SCP-3261-2a in the morning. || Lyrics are typical of modern love songs, although analysis of the paper and ink has determined it was composed in the early 1910s. SCP-3261-2j is the longest known instance of SCP-3261-2. ||

**Addendum 3261-01:** SCP-3261-3j9, a man standing near the well in SCP-3261-2j, was interviewed by Researcher Hidekazu ███████. A transcript of the interview is attached below.

**Addendum 3261-02:** A journal (now designated SCP-3261-3g9) was recovered from SCP-3261-2g, thought to belong to SCP-3261-3g1. An excerpt from the journal is attached below.
[[collapsible show="Document 3261-1" hide="Document 3261-1"]]
> Well, I guess I'm a citizen of Kabaoka. I don't know shit about Japanese, but I figure that's the name of this place. There's really nothing interesting here. If I could choose anywhere to go, this would be at the very bottom of my list. In fact, I wouldn't even have ended up here if I had just stopped playing that damn koto, then and there. It was just laying there at that curios shop, with a few pieces of paper I couldn't even read. I bought it, played a song, and boom, I'm in some village. The first few times I played it, everything went fine, I got out. But no, this time I had to get stuck here. How did this even happen?
