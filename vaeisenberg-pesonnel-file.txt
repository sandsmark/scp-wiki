**Name:**  Vladim A. Eisenberg к.т.н.

**Security Clearance:** Level 2

**Education:** Specialist Diploma, Charkov Polytechnic, Candidate of Technical Sciences (к.т.н), Vladivostok Polytechnic, Absolvent of Evening University of Marxism-Leninism.
 
**Specialisation:**  Material Science, SCP Research, Containment procedures.

**Site of Operations:** Recently transferred to Site 19. Formerly [REDACTED], Ural Mountains.

**Profile:** Dr. Eisenberg is a recent addition to Site 19, transferred after a Chaos Insurgency attack on [REDACTED], currently responsible for cataloging objects encountered within Central and Eastern Europe. Reasonably hard working and capable but bitter at the lack of promotion opportunities both on Site 19 and his former placement, Dr. Eisenberg is most known among Site 19 staff for his heavy accent, profuse swearing, imbibing large quantities of tea, and an almost unhealthy fascination with lynxes.
Reacts adversely to any mention of pure titanium.

//**Excerpt from yearly psychiatric evaluation:**  ...Dr. Eisenberg is not to be let near any feline objects contained on site. SCP-███ is not "cute and fuzzy", it doesn't even have fur for [REDACTED]'s sake. Dr. █████//
