title:Lumancer
**Name:** ██████ ████
**Alias:** Lumancer
**Position:** Researcher

**Acquisition:** Prior to employment with the Foundation, Researcher Lumancer was a graduate student in the fields of Cultural Anthropology and Cryptosociology at ███ ████ █████ University in ███ ████ ██████, CA. Consequently, Lumancer was a witness to the the 2005 activation of SCP-████ and subsequent Type-P Sinking Preacher event at that location (see document C41901Y-AIA for details). As per standard operating procedure, he was escorted to Site-30 and debriefed. However, upon administration of Class B amnesiac,  Lumancer suffered a severe allergic reaction and required emergency assistance from Foundation medical personnel. Following his recovery, Lumancer was retained for identification and study of his allergy.  

It was ultimately determined that Lumancer's allergies to ███████ and ██████████ interfere with the standard function of all chemical amnesiacs currently approved for use on civilians, precluding him from release to the general population. As his profile was found to be acceptable for Foundation employment, termination was deemed unnecessary. Lumancer was subsequently appointed a level 2 Researcher and transferred to Reliquary Site-09.
