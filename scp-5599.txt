**Item #:** SCP-5599

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** All copies of SCP-5599 are held in one of [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-77| Site-77]]]'s medium-capacity vaults. Mobile Task Force Eta-6 ("##red|Presented## ##green|In## ##blue|Color##") have been dispatched to thrift stores and garage sales in the Appalachian region to recover any additional copies of SCP-5599 which exist outside of containment.

Exposure to SCP-5599-related materials is highly restricted, with D-5599 being the designation for the exposed individual being studied. Any other living beings found to have been affected by SCP-5599 are to be euthanized.

**Description:** SCP-5599 refers to data present on approximately 1,500 cartridges produced for the Atari Video Computer System. They are playable on any computing system with a cartridge slot large enough to accommodate it, even if no actual connection is made.

When inserted into such a slot, SCP-5599 produces scrambled bitmap graphics and assorted sounds. Although reactive to controller inputs, it is difficult to assess what SCP-5599's intended content was -- as frequent crashing often leads to corruption of the systems interpreting its data.

The following effects are not known to be universal, but have been observed in testing.

Loading SCP-5599 or analyzing its assets has caused all subjects who have been designated D-5599 to experience permanent hearing loss. First reporting mild tinnitus, D-5599's hearing degraded over a period of six months until only being able to hear sounds which could have been produced by an ,,MOS Technology 6532 sound chip.,, Neurological pattern recognition degenerates once [[span style="color:#868686"]]the deafening is complete.[[/span]]

[[span style="font-family: Arial]]The semicircular canals, vestibule, cochlea, and other auditory organs[[/span]] are not outwardly damaged but will no longer detect audio as expected.  Subjects may also develop [[span style="font-family: Arial Black]]visual impairment relating to pattern recognition[[/span]] such as prosopagnosia. The temporal lobe will  [[span style="font-family: Arial;"color:#868686"]]become desiccated[[/span]][[footnote]]Mummified[[/footnote]] in subjects experiencing this effect and may lead to them being totally  [[span style="color:#868686"]]unable to communicate.[[/span]]

[[size 80%]]##white|Left alone in their head##[[/size]]

[[span style="font-family: Courier]]SCP-5599 can be perceived normally by affected subjects with some preferring to hear[[/span]] [[span style="color:#868686"]]harsh[[/span]] sounds than nothing at all. The reduction in human lifespan among exposed subjects is statistically significant. Further study is required to determine whether this is due  [[span style="color:#868686"]]to brain damage,[[/span]] [[span style="color:#d9d9d9"]]profound[[/span]]social isolation, or a combination of  [[span style="color:#868686"]]other factors. [[/span]][[span style="color:#dfdfdf"]]Alone in the mirror on the bathroom floor[[/span]]

[[span style="font-family: Geneva"]]D-5599 claims that repeatedly viewing SCP-5599's output moderately stabilizes the graphics. Even  [[/span]][[span style="color:#868686"]]after[[/span]] [[span style="color:#868686"]]being made to forget[[/span]], D-5599 has consistently described guiding a small object [[footnote]]Hypothesized to be a bowl or glass[[/footnote]] through a crude graphical depiction of a golf course and into a hole. Once the hole has been filled, a large marine animal[[footnote]]Possibly a fish or shark[[/footnote]]will consume the object. On-screen text  [[span style="color:#868686"]]such as [[/span]][[span style="color:#d9d9d9"]]"keep the red army red algae blooms at bay"[[/span]] and [[span style="color:#d9d9d9"]]"The Ocean's aer(sic) die" appears before the program[[/span]] ##white|crashes.##

SCP-5599 was discovered in 1983 after the Appalachian region of the United States saw an [[span style="font-family: Courier New"]]unusual spike in deafness.[[/span]]

**Addendum:** Interview 5599-Y.

D-5599 speaks with Dr. Sanitatem about the progression of SCP-5599's effect and its impact on their ability to communicate.
