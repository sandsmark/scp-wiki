**Item #:** SCP-1250

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1250 Is to be kept in a small single-lock safe at Site-██. SCP-1250 is not to be actively monitored by any staff or equipment, and needs only to be checked and emptied every 10-12 hours in order to prevent its contents from overflowing. SCP-1250 may only be handled when accompanied by personnel with level three (3) clearance or higher. If no materials are found within SCP-1250for a period of more than 24 hours, contact Dr. Carter or equivalent level 3 staff immediately.

**Description:** SCP-1250 is a small glass jar, 8 (eight) cm tall and 3 (three) cm wide at the mouth. The jar will periodically produce a number of long, thick, black hairs (SCP-1250-1) when not directly or indirectly observed, regardless of its location. Unrelated items stored within the jar for any length of time will also prevent SCP-1250-1 from materializing. Individual strands of SCP-1250-1 range from 36-43cm in length, and analysis has concluded that SCP-1250-1 do not originate from any known species of mammal. 

SCP-1250 came into foundation custody following an overflow of the jar's contents on ██/██/199█, which lead to the immediate evacuation of the ████████ Police Dept. The object was initally discovered in a blue 1992 Chevy Camaro, located on the side of a road in ██████████ County. Local authorities were contacted after several eyewitnesses reported the vehicle speeding down the nearby interstate and nearly colliding with other cars as it made an effort to pass them. The Camaro was found at 3:56 the following morning with the driver nowhere to be seen and its tank on empty. Apart from the Jar, a total of 56 TDK D-C60 compact cassettes were recovered from the vehicle, one of which was located in the car's tape player. A small pair of scissors, several local newspapers, tourist pamphlets, a United States road map, and 2 unused disposable Kodak cameras were also salvaged from the site.

Further examination of the cassettes revealed that their miniature spools were wound with thin white hairs (SCP-1250-2) in the place of magnetic tape. When a cassette containing SCP-1250-2 was played, a voice came clearly out of the tape deck, confirmed to be that of former president John F. Kennedy, heard delivering a speech detailing the [REDACTED]. It was discovered that while several similar speeches exist in records, no speech matching this recording was ever given.

Other tapes with samples of SCP-1250-2 were quickly tested and were found to contain similarly bizarre recordings. Several featured unknown individuals talking, ambient sounds of nature or machinery, animal calls, fire sirens, and in some instances gunfire. A number of other speeches from a range of persons including  R████ ████, █████ █████████, F████ C█████, and M█████ ██████ ████ ███ were found among the collection, and in every instance the SCP-1250-2 recordings did not match any known records. Similar inconsistencies were found with recordings of television and radio broadcasts. SCP-1250-2 can not be overwritten, and all attempts to transfer data to different formats have failed. A collection of the recordings recovered from the Camaro are detailed in file [DATA EXPUNGED].

After reviewing all 56 of the tapes, Dr. T████ began experimenting on the SCP-1250-1 samples collected from the jar.  These black hairs were found to contain no recorded material of their own, but were capable of having new recordings written onto them. Initial testing had researchers and other staff conducting standard interviews with SCP-1250-1 tapes alongside their usual equipment. When played back, these recordings were indeed those of the interviews conducted, but with slight alterations from what the involved staff remember. These alterations, while inconsistent, are initially never drastic. The conversation is always about the topic at hand, but changes such as differences in pronunciation, word choice, or even an individual's gender were found when compared to the standard tapes, with multiple simultaneous SCP-1250-1 recordings further altering the proceedings.

Testing has also shown that SCP-1250-1 samples do not appear to have any storage limit. Recording can continue indefinitely until manually stopped. However, once stopped, the SCP-1250-1 becomes a sample of SCP-1250-2 containing the new recording, and no new data can be written to it. More tests utilizing the samples in a number of situations are currently underway. Notable test results will be recorded in [[[experiment-log-1250|Experiment Log 1250-A]]]

------

**Addendum 1250-1:** A series of trials performed between 07/██/2006 and 09/██/2006 determined that SCP-1250-1 are capable of recording video if placed into a standard VHS tape. Visual discrepancies will manifest in the place of aural, as SCP-1250-2 samples containing image data produce no audio when reviewed. 

 **Addendum 1250-2:** As a result of Dr. T████'s passing on ██/██/2010, the project has been handed over to Dr. Carter. He has requested that no further video experimentation to be performed for the time being. The hiatus will be lifted at a future date at his discretion. Observations made during this line of testing have been archived in [[[experiment-log-1250|Experiment Log 1250-B]]]
