title:And Then I Died...
Welcome to //And Then I Died...//, an SCP collective writing game!  Useful information is held behind a collapsible tab right here: [[collapsible show="Click Here to Learn The Rules of the Game" hide="Click Here to Make This Go Away"]]

This is pretty simple.  The idea of this game is to compose an encounter with an SCP without overtly revealing what SCP it actually is.  The rules are basic, and as follows:

1. Whoever guessed the last one correctly (information about guessing at the bottom) has to write the next one. If you don't want to write, then don't guess.  Feel free to sit back, relax, and say "Oh! I got it right!" when you do.

2. If you're writing the new one, try to keep it under 500 words. This is a game, not a novel.  Also, try to get it written within a day or two (a week at the longest), so the game can keep moving forward.  If you fail to write your entry quickly enough, a judge will step in and write it for you.

3. While not required, a few red herrings are definitely encouraged, so long as the final solution is the most likely/most obvious answer.  Having someone die from exposure to  [[[SCP-008]]] while [[[SCP-682]]] eats their torso and they're fired from the Sun Launcher... Not gonna work.

4.  Try to make it... well... not obvious, but... guessable.  Going for something needlessly obtuse will make the game no fun for anyone.

5. The character "speaking" (and this is the most important rule) //must// die at the end.  It might not be from the SCP in question, so long as their exposure caused it somehow.  

6. If no one guesses your SCP, then congrats!  After a week or so, let everyone know how clever you were, and write another one.

7. If you're the author, make sure you send a message to [http://www.wikidot.com/account/messages#/new/451071 TroyL], [http://www.wikidot.com/account/messages#/new/508888 Ragazzo], or [http://www.wikidot.com/account/messages#/new/481882 Dexanote]  to let them know the answer. Troy, Ragz and Dex will be recusing themselves from making any further guesses to function in this capacity.  Winners will be posted in the discussion thread for this page, so keep your eyes open! Maybe you won! 

If there are any questions, or a need for clarification, please notify the game judging people things, TroyL, Ragazzo or Dexanote, in the chat.  Thanks, and have a good time reading and guessing!

**Round One: TroyL**

I laughed when they told me about the faeries that would occasionally appear around the room, especially since I'd not really been around and SCP like this one before. Heh. To think, I was going to be working at Site-19. It was going to fun! So much fun!

I yawned and looked around the room, scratching my neck and peering over at the sensors, watching the blips and swatting away the little, winged nuisances. Mostly things I could ignore...

After a moment, though, one of the blips goes too high. The machine lets out a soft alarm, and with a sigh, I push myself up and open the observation door, walking over to the bed and glancing down at the sleeping form there.  Nothing that I can see, but to be safe... 

I grab the syringe (there are always a full stash of everything I might need right next to the bed) and slide it into the IV, depressing it and tossing it into the bin. I walk back and look down at her, smiling, then...

Her lips are moving. I can almost make out what they're saying? Avoid Cameras? Abba Concierto? Abra Ka-

And then I died.

**Round Two: Scantron**

Oh, oh man. I can't believe that worked. Do you think they even saw anyone take their tickets? Probably not. Shit, stop giggling man! You're sounding like your girlfriend. Let's just hope... aw, fuck yeah. Nosebleed seats. Eh, it's not like it's setting us back anything.

...fuck. **Fuck.** The fuck was that shit? We aren't paying this guy ten mil a year to hit easy pop-ups. I don't even know //what//'s going on. You think maybe they could have spared a few funds from the renovation to get some decent fucking players, right? I mean, we have enough medieval stuff in that one guy in left field, the one with the mustache.

Just... well, hey, it's most of the way over. We're not losing /too/ badly, right? And their relief pitcher, what's his name, he's kinda shitty, so we have a shot. Oh, look, s'pose we should stand up and sing along. I always loved this song...

Fuck, this is tingly, I don't kn-

And then I died.

**Round Three: Vlemich**

Damn this heat! This isn't what I signed up for at all. I can't believe they sent us down to this God-forsaken land. I'm getting sick of the Austrians all over the place. It would be nice just to see a few more Englishmen around here to make things feel more like home. Oh well, just another day of watching over platoons. At least I managed to land an easy gig! All I have to do is sit up on this rooftop, out of sight, out of mind for all these damn gun toting soldiers.

Finally some action! And lucky me, all I have to do is sit up here and start picking off any threats I find. Look at those boys go! Those new guns are really clearing the way for our boys! For the Queen!

Each man is moving professionally, coordinated through the small village. These small militia might not be well equipped, but orders from the top are to put them down before they can gain enough support and man power to become a threat. I guess I can respect nipping it in the bud, but it's almost too easy. Just look how securely those Tommys are getting through this little place! Alright, time to buckle down and keep an eye out for them….

WHAT IN THE HELL IS GOING ON? Damnit, this is turning bad quick! I can't even see any return fire! One, two… five men down already at this one stupid little hut! What the fuck! Damnit, I can't see anything! Shit, shit, SHIT! Where are they? GOD DAMNIT the whole damned platoon is going down! Son of a bitch! Ah fuck, somebody is coming out of the hut… Line up the sights… I don't know how you took out a whole platoon but you're about to go down mother fucker. He is looking around at the dead bodies now. All I need is a clean shot at his head. He comes out into the open; heart is racing; sights are lined up; a clean shot to the head, wait, what's wrong with his face? No matter; I slowly squeeze the trigger.

And then I died.

To guess, send a PM to one of the three judges by clicking their name here: [http://www.wikidot.com/account/messages#/new/451071 TroyL], [http://www.wikidot.com/account/messages#/new/508888 Ragazzo], or [http://www.wikidot.com/account/messages#/new/481882 Dexanote]. Alternatively, you can enter the **#site19** chat and send a PM to one of the three judges: TroyL (alias MechaTroy), Ragazzo, or Dexanote (alias ProfChainsawFace, or anything with Dexa in his name).  They'll let you know if you've guessed correctly.  Generally, you only get one guess, so  make sure you think you're right before you take a swing at it!  If you win, then congrats! You get to write the next one.  Have fun!
