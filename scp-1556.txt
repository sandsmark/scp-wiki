**Item #:** SCP-1556

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** As SCP-1556 avoids human contact and currently roams an area greater than 15 km from any human settlement or roadway, containment procedures require only that the herd be monitored and tracked. Ground personnel tracking SCP-1556 must maintain a distance of at least 200 m at all times, and must not openly carry any weapons as this may trigger a defensive response.

Experiments involving the tranquilization of individual SCP-1556 specimens have been suspended indefinitely.

**Description:** SCP-1556 is a herd of --sixteen (16)-- fifteen (15) free-roaming feral Mustang horses inhabiting a region approximately 35 km southwest of [REDACTED] in the United States, consisting of one (1) lead stallion, --eight (8)-- seven (7) mares, and seven (7) juveniles. Individual specimens of SCP-1556 are recognizable by their behavior, reflective amber eyes (implying the presence of //tapetum lucidum//), and the constant emission of mist from their skin.

The mist emitted from SCP-1556 is constant and forms a blanket of considerable size centered on the herd that is only temporarily dissipated by significantly adverse weather such as a wind or rainstorm. The composition of this mist is consistent with that of low-lying fog with the exception of trace amounts of suspended organic compounds. Exposure to high concentrations or over extended periods of time causes accelerated corrosion in metallic items and dizziness and headaches in human subjects, but in the latter case have not been shown to cause any lasting harm.

SCP-1556 exhibits greater strength and endurance than is normal for feral horses, as well as a higher level of intelligence; SCP-1556 has been observed exhibiting behavior such as mutual grooming, problem-solving, and coordination that is highly unusual for equine species.

**Addendum 1556-01:** Incident 1556-09

On █/██/12, oversight approval was granted to attempt to tranquilize SCP-1556-3, the lead mare, for field examination and tagging. Shortly after being struck by a tranquilizer dart fired by Foundation field researchers, SCP-1556-3 went into convulsions and collapsed. It is not known at this time whether SCP-1556-3 was allergic to the tranquilizer or whether the dosage was greatly overestimated, but the remaining individuals of SCP-1556 became high aggressive, attacking any personnel wielding a firearm or attempting to approach the body of SCP-1556-3. All personnel were ordered to retreat to a safe distance to treat injuries and observe the herd, and the body of SCP-1556-3 was missing the following morning.

Since this incident, SCP-1556 has avoided human contact and makes aggressive movements towards any personnel approaching the herd. Further experimentation has been suspended until further notice.
