**Item #:** SCP-082

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Enlarged living quarters located at Armed Bio-Containment Area-14 have been appropriated for the suppression and appeasement of SCP-082. Standard weapons have little effect in policing SCP-082. Subject is currently under the impression that he has been made the King of France and that his containment area is actually a grand palace designed for his protection. All interacting personnel are to be made aware of this ruse and must not contradict his understanding of the situation on threat of execution. Guards and housekeeping personnel should be Class D personnel only.

Task Force Phi-1 is charged with guarding his general quarters but are not allowed close contact with SCP-082.


**Description:** SCP-082 is genetically human; however, through some process (either chemical, hormonal, cancerous, or supernatural), SCP-082 has grown to giant proportions. Approximately 2.4 meters tall (around 8 ft) and weighing over 310 kg (about 700 lb), the physical characteristics of SCP-082's are grossly disproportional. He has a slightly pointed balding head, a large rounded chin and jaw, a bulbous nose, and dark sunken eyes. He is both overweight and possesses a great amount of muscle mass. His forearms are muscular and dangerous, with a circumference of about 71 cm (about 28 in). The breadth of his fist is nearly 30 cm along the knuckles (almost 12 in) Though his feet are large, they are small in proportion to his body (men's size 14 US).

SCP-082 refers to himself as Fernand and speaks both French and English. His physical appearance is compounded by numerous scars over his body (the results of years of attempts at suppression and containment). His skin is tanned dark and he refuses to bathe, though he often changes clothes. When he speaks, he does so through his enormous, clenched teeth. SCP-082 only parts his teeth to eat food and to sing, which he does often. He will sing songs of his pleasing, ranging from forgotten Victorian Era bar songs to modern classical, typically while he cooks and eats. SCP-082 does not comb the hair on the sides of his head, but he does cut it and shaves with a large butcher knife that he uses in food preparation. It should be noted that even the hair on his face is exaggerated, a single strand being as thick as a millimeter (similar in thickness and look of graphite of a mechanical pencil). Occasionally, SCP-082 will clench his teeth so hard that his gums bleed, but it is not known why he does this. X-rays have been difficult to interpret because of the high density of his muscle tissue, but studies have revealed countless bullets and even several knife and sword blades lodged in the flesh of SCP-082.

The demeanor of SCP-082 is very amicable and carefree. He enjoys dressing up in many different fashions, including formal wear, military uniform, as a clown, and in women's clothing. He often attempts to joke and is usually polite to SCP personnel, often inviting them to dinner. However, visiting personnel should be aware that at any moment, SCP-082 is capable of attacking and voraciously eating others. He will often apologize for his lack of manners for interrupting someone's conversation by devouring their head or making a mess of his quarters. The powerful jaws of SCP-082 are strong enough to crack bone, but he often eats around most long bones, although he enjoys the skull. His attacks are seemingly at random with no motivation--whether he's recently eaten or not has no effect on his cannibalistic hunger.

His greatest vulnerability is that SCP-082 is incapable of differentiating fact from fiction when he reads it or watches television/films. On several occasions, SCP-082 has expressed a great desire to meet his favorite person, Hannibal Lecter, and he believes all his favorite shows, such as "Law and Order," are reality television. Though he has shown heightened intelligence in the form of memory and puzzle-solving, the concepts of parody, satire, and fiction are beyond him. SCP-082 apparently understands the concept of lying, has shown to know when others are blatantly lying, and generally tells obvious falsehoods when asked about his past. According to SCP-082, he is:

* A Vampire
* A Homunculus
* Big Bird
* Andre the Giant
* Napoleon
* Obelix (sidekick of Asterix) 
* The Hulk
* Alexander The Great

When questioned about these lies he gives the excuse, "But I only lie when it's through my teeth!"
