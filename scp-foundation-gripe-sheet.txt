Foundation personnel submit maintenance reports, also known as "gripe forms", to inform level 2 site mechanic teams about any problems they experience with containment cells and connected facilities. Mechanics process the reports, solve the problems, and document their repair solutions on the reports. Submitted problems are marked with a "P", while the solutions are marked with an "S" and filed away by the maintenance crew once resolved.
