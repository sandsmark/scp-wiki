[[module Rate]]
[[/>]]

Foundation personnel submit maintenance reports, also known as "gripe forms", to inform level 2 site mechanics about any problems they experience with containment cells and connected facilities. The maintenance crews process the requests, solve the problems, document their repair solutions and file the reports away by once resolved. Submitted problems are marked with a "P", while the solutions are marked with an "S".

//Note: Submitted reports are listed ten per page, with newer reports added at the bottom of the last page. Requests come in daily for all manner of odd tasks, often well outside of normal maintenance work. Luckily, inner site maintenance crews can take a joke. -Head Maintenance Supervisor Jaimison//

**Standard format for reports:**
> **P:** Problem reported.
> **S:** Solution carried out.

**Example:**
> **P:** The Foundation is a cold and dangerous place to work in.
> **S:** It helps to have a sense of humor.
