[[tab Welcome]]
> Memo: Welcome to Kiryu Labs!
> 
> Lab Director: Dr. M. Kiryu (PhD, Psychology)
> Head Assistant Researcher: R. Mercer
> 
> Kiryu Labs is a Site-19-based collection of experimental rooms designed to process low-priority anomalous items of varying properties. Personnel associated with Kiryu Labs are required to have substantial laboratory training and proficiency in experimental design and documentation. Personnel from all specializations welcome.
> 
> The Foundation designates caches of anomalous items to be examined by Kiryu Labs each week. Occasionally, personnel may be assigned to leave the site to investigate an anomalous object and report on further containment action. During these tasks, transportation and requisite provisions will be provided accordingly; further specific travel-related resources are available upon request.
> 
> Any general questions may be directed to Dr. Kiryu. For new assignments relating to department transfer and/or temporary lab research work, please contact Researcher Mercer.

There are 18 rooms total that make up Kiryu Labs.

Experimental Room 217’s color scheme is a cold, clinical white, and the brushed steel supply cabinets gleam dull silver under the fluorescent lighting. Temperature controls and other such machinery panels buzz imperceptibly near the three doors. Mounted security cameras are positioned along each wall, eight in total. In the center of the rectangular room is what looks like a small pit; it is three feet deep and wide enough for several people to walk around in it fairly comfortably.

Experimental Room 205, affectionately known as "the combustion lab", is a patchwork of concrete and calcium silicate paneling. Neat racks of fire-resistant clothing, fire blankets, and fire extinguishers are located on each of the four walls. Supply cabinets and wheeled tables are scattered evenly throughout the relatively large space; the few machines in the room are concealed behind fireproof barriers.

Experimental Room 208 looks like it'd be more suited to an old-fashioned dojo or martial arts school, instead of a research facility. Wood paneling lines the walls, rectangular sections of the floor are padded, and the assortment of tables around the room are scattered with various tools used for antique maintenance.

These and the other rooms are where a few of the Foundation’s caches of anomalous items (not quite interesting enough to merit special containment, not quite harmless enough to be stuffed in a broom closet) are processed.

“Hey, Riven?”

“Yes, Dr. Kiryu?”

“Call me Mark. Riven, if you were a tree, what kind of tree would you be and why?”

“…are you serious? I just got assigned here and we’ve got a month’s backlog of anomalous items to process.”

“Riven. Riven. Hey hey Riven Riv Riv Riven hey hey.”

“What is it, Mark.”

“Riven if someone burst into this room foaming at the mouth and waving a butter knife at you, which item on your desk would you use to defend yourself?”

“Stapler. Or your potted bamboo.”

“But that’s on //my// desk.”

“I know. If you want to psychoanalyze me, then you’ll have to get proper documentation for it. We’ve got work to do.”

“Happy morning to you, you’ve got research to do, it looks like a long day--”

“Mark, why are you singing?”

“I think I mixed up the decaf tea. What’s your favorite constellation, Rivs?”

“It’s Draco. Did you book the experimental room for this afternoon?”

“Morning, Riven.”

“Morning, Mark.”

“…”

“…Hey, Mark?”

“Yeah?”

“If you have any bird as a pet, which one would you choose and why?”

“Tough question. Probably a nice little song sparrow or something else that sings and is little. Or a Peregrine Falcon. Fastest animal alive, beautiful plumage, and can take out birds in midair. Raptor. Dinosaur murder-birdie.”

“Right. I’m having trouble reconciling the two. You sure you don’t have a split personality?”

“What about you, Riven? Birds, I mean.”

“I like lizards more.”

“Lizards, huh?”

“Yeah.”

And that was how Kiryu Labs came to own a somewhat-grumpy Bearded Dragon named Crellan, who now lives in a terrarium in the sitting room.
