**Item #:** SCP-092

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-092 is to be stored in Locker #8A at Research Site-14, kept in a 1 m^^3^^ cube made from clear plexiglass 35 mm thick. SCP-092 must be suspended on a near-frictionless spindle in the exact center of the box, with the reflective side parallel with, and pointing to, the bottom of the box. Storage cube must be kept in vacuum at all times to minimize air friction.

SCP-092's rate of rotation will be monitored by redundant optical sensors that will page Dr. ██████████████ and Dr. █████████ if the item's speed drops below 750 RPM or rises above 1250 RPM. These sensors require illumination with a 2100-lumen halogen bulb, all of  which are mounted on top of the plexiglass cube. A Level 1 technician will inspect SCP-092's containment cube on a weekly basis, verifying the bulb is still functional and initiating a manual test page from the monitoring hardware. Bulb must be replaced and lubrication applied to the spindle every thirty-seven days. Personnel responsible for SCP-092 container maintenance will refer to document #092-1 to ensure no loss of illumination during bulb replacement or spindle failures.

Additional optical sensors on the bottom of the cube will observe the pattern and log the position of laser light emanating from the bottom of SCP-092 as it spins. These sensors are to be maintained by Dr. ██████████████ only, and will not be tampered with by anyone below a Level 4 clearance.

**Emergency Procedures:** If SCP-092 experiences spindle failure or is accidentally unmounted from its spindle, under no circumstances should the item be removed from its box. Hold SCP-092 firmly in one hand with the hand extended into the box through the top, and repair or replace the spindle using the other hand. Remount SCP-092 on spindle when finished.

**Description:** SCP-092 appears to be a standard audio CD, 120 mm in diameter, 1.5 mm thick. Composition appears to be plastic, with a reflective surface on one side. The other side is coated with white enamel with the words "The 5th Dimension - Greatest Hits On Earth."

Item was found with other audio CDs among the personal items of the late Dr. ██████ while clearing out the remaining items in his living quarters after his ██████████████ ███████ during observation of ████████. [Level 4 personnel see #1712-01, "Incident/Casualty Report"] SCP-092 was discovered inside a plastic CD enclosure, spinning freely with no visible means of propulsion at an estimated rate of 800 RPM. Removal of SCP-092 from its case was performed by hand, at which time the item responded to hand-applied friction and stopped spinning. Item resumed spinning when placed on a coffee table nearby, accelerating quickly and peaking at roughly the same RPM as previously observed.

Further interaction with SCP-092 revealed that the item does not follow standard laws of gravity. SCP-092 has no measurable weight. When not in direct contact with any surface or object that would serve to tether it, item appears to maintain its exact position in 3-dimensional space, which means relative to an observer on the Earth's surface, the item shoots out in a westerly direction at a rate equal to the speed of the Earth's rotation around the sun (~100,000 km/h) until it comes in contact with another surface or tether. SCP-092 offers no resistance to changes in position or speed of rotation. When mounted on a spindle, it will spin freely at a rate observed anywhere between 800 and 1100 RPM, with a sourceless torque measured at 4.5 kg-cm.

The reflective side of the disk emanates a faint, thin red beam of laser light from a point on its surface. The position of this light from the center of the disk has been measured to move from 52 mm to 47 mm, then jump back to 52 mm every 3 minutes 46 seconds. Observation of a standard CD of The 5th Dimension's "Greatest Hits On Earth" album leads to the conclusion that the laser light pattern mirrors the laser position and duration of a CD player playing track 9, "Up, Up, and Away," on perpetual repeat.

Playing SCP-092 on a standard CD player is impossible due to the excess torque produced, but SCP-092 does produce audio when the CD player drive motor is disabled, allowing the player to read the freely spinning disk.

The leading theory regarding its nature is that SCP-092 is a three-dimensional manifestation of an extradimensional CD that is playing in a five-dimensional CD player. This theoretical CD player would both provide the torque to spin SCP-092 as well as the reflected laser light from its underside.

**Note:** //The existence of SCP-092 in the 3rd dimension can be better pictured by imagining the universe as a flattened 2-dimensional plane, which is intersected by a long, worm-like tube that intersects the universe in one or perhaps several places. SCP-092 may then be thought of as a single cross-section of the tube, the entirety of which exists in the 5th spatial dimension and whose body intersects this universe and an infinite number of other 3-dimensional universes.// --Dr. O'Hara
