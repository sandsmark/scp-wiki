**Item #:** SCP-092

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:**

Item SCP-092 is to be stored in Locker #8A Research Site-14, kept in a cube made of 35mm thick clear plexiglass, dimensions 1m x 1m x 1m. SCP-092 must be suspended on a near-frictionless spindle in the exact center of the box, with the reflective side parallel with, and pointing to, the bottom of the box. Storage cube must be kept in vacuum at all times to minimize air friction.

Optical monitoring hardware mounted on top of the cube will monitor item's RPM rate, which is to notify Drs. ██████████████ and █████████ by pager when the item's speed drops below 750 RPM or above 1250 RPM. The optical sensor requires the item to be illuminated with a 2100-lumen halogen bulb, which is also mounted on top of the cube. A Level 1 technician will inspect SCP-092's containment cube on a weekly basis, verifying the bulb is still functional and initiating a manual test page from the monitoring hardware. Bulb must be replaced and lubrication applied to the spindle every thirty-seven days. Personnel responsible for SCP-092 container maintenance will refer to document #092-1 to ensure no loss of illumination during bulb replacement or spindle failures.

Additional optical monitoring hardware on the bottom of the cube will observe the pattern, and log the position of, laser light emanating from the bottom of SCP-092 as it spins. This hardware is to be maintained by Dr. ██████████████ only, and will not be tampered with by anyone below a Level 4 clearance.

**Emergency Procedures:** If SCP-092 experiences spindle failure or is accidentally unmounted from its spindle, under no circumstances should the item be removed from the box. Hold the SCP-092 firmly in one hand with the hand extended into the box through the top, and repair or replace the spindle using the other hand. Remount SCP-092 on spindle when finished.

**Description:**

SCP-092 is a disk shaped object 120 mm in diameter, 1.5 mm thick. Composition appears to be plastic, with a reflective surface on one side and the other side coated with white enamel, on which is written the words "The 5th Dimension - Greatest Hits On Earth." Appearance is identical to a standard audio CD.

Item was found among other audio CDs among the personal items of the late Dr. ██████ while clearing out the remaining items in his living quarters after his ██████████████ ███████ during observation of ████████. [Level 4 personnel see #1712-01, "Incident/Casualty Report"] SCP-092 was discovered inside a plastic CD enclosure, spinning freely with no visible means of propulsion at an estimated rate of 800 RPM. Removal of SCP-092 from its case was performed by hand, at which time the item responded to hand-applied friction and stopped spinning. Item resumed spinning when placed on a coffee table nearby, accelerating quickly and peaking at roughly the same RPM as previously observed.

Further interaction with SCP-092 revealed item does not follow standard laws of gravity. SCP-092 has no measurable weight. When not in direct contact with any surface or object that would serve to tether it, item appears to maintain its exact position in 3-dimensional space, which means relative to an observer on the Earth's surface, the item shoots out in a westerly direction at a rate equal to the speed of the Earth's rotation around the sun (~100,000 km/h) until it comes in contact with another surface or tether. SCP-092 offers no resistance to changes in position or speed of revolution. When mounted on a spindle, it will spin freely at a rate observed anywhere between 800 and 1100 RPM, with a sourceless torque measured at 4.5 kg-cm.

The reflective side of the disk emanates a faint, thin red beam of laser light from a point on its surface. The position of this light from the center of the disk has been measured to move from 52mm to 47mm, then jump back to 52mm every 3 minutes 46 seconds. Observation of a standard CD of The 5th Dimension's "Greatest Hits On Earth" album leads to the conclusion that the laser light pattern mirrors the laser position and duration of a CD player playing track 9, "Up, Up, and Away," on perpetual repeat.

Playing SCP-092 as a standard audio CD on a CD player is impossible due to the excess torque, but item does produce audio when the CD player drive motor is disabled, allowing the player to read the freely spinning disk.

The conclusion regarding the nature of SCP-092 is that the item is a 3D manifestation of an extradimensional audio CD, which is currently playing in a CD player in the 5th dimension. The theoretical 5th dimensional CD player provides both the torque required for a CD player to read a standard audio CD, and the light emanating from the bottom of SCP-092 is explainable by this theory as a reflection of the laser from the extradimensional CD player.

Existence of SCP-092 in the 3rd dimension can be better pictured by imagining the universe as a flattened 2-dimensional plane, which is intersected by a long, worm-like tube that intersects the universe in one or perhaps several places. SCP-092 may then be thought of as a single cross-section of the tube, the entirety of which exists in the 5th spatial dimension and whose body intersects this universe and an infinite number of other 3-dimensional universes.

It is unknown whether SCP-092 was a 3-dimensional audio CD turned extradimensional by some dimensional shifting event, or if the object naturally originated in the 5th dimension. It is also unclear how the disk came into Dr. ██████'s possession. Current research is limited to observation of the disk's RPM speed and position of the laser light to record any changes in pattern.
