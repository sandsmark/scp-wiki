title:Official Anti-Harassment Policy
The SCP Foundation community is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, religion, or other personal traits. 

We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

This code of conduct applies to all SCP Foundation community spaces, including the SCP Foundation wiki, [[[Chat Guide|#site19]]], [[[http://05command.wikidot.com/chat|#site17]]], and private messages to other community members. 

This code of conduct also applies indirectly to behavior in side chats associated with the SCP Foundation community; harassing behavior in unofficial or side chats may result in consequences in official community spaces.

Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the Anti-Harassment Team.

+ What Is Harassment?

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

* Negative or unwanted interactions with (or comments towards) a person related to gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, race, physical or mental attributes, etc.
* Sexual images or behaviors in inappropriate places and contexts, especially when directed towards other users.
 * For instance, sexual imagery is permitted in #site19 when tagged "NSFW". However, a sexual image or comment sent to a person who hasn't asked for it is usually harassment.
* Unwelcome sexual attention, including sending users sexual images, pressuring sexual discussion or interaction, or repeated unwanted flirting.
* Threats of violence or encouragement of any form of self-harm toward any individual.
* Deliberate intimidation.
* Following users to other sites or stalking them online.
* Repeated inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others.
* Repeated one-on-one communication after being asked to stop.
* Publication of private communication for the express purpose of humiliating/shaming/harming another user, including 'outing' aspects of another person's identity without their consent.
* Frivolous/false accusations with the explicit intention to get someone else banned from the site.
* Encouraging any of the above behavior.

++ What Isn't Harassment?

The Anti-Harassment Team deals only with personal harassment-based offenses. Other offenses are under the purview of the site's [http://05command.wikidot.com/disciplinary-main Disciplinary Team] (for the site) or chat operators (for IRC chat).

If you're unsure, feel free to ask a member of the Anti-Harassment Team or whichever staff member you feel comfortable with.

+++ Rules Violations

It is entirely possible to break the rules without harassing anyone. If someone is being an asshole, acting unnecessarily aggressive, or expressing bigoted, non-targeted opinions, it does not necessarily mean they're harassing someone. 

If you feel that any rule-breaking behavior took place which targeted either you or another user for the purpose of causing harm, then you should report it to the Anti-Harassment Team.

+++ Other Interactions

These interactions are not rules violations or harassment by themselves. This is not a complete list.

* Critique of a user's SCP Foundation work, unless the critique is being used to further other harassment.
* Challenging or questioning someone's beliefs or behavior.
* Basic, public interactions with an ex-friend or a disliked user.
* Personal fights between friends, even if the fight ends the friendship.

+ Reporting

If you are being harassed by a member of the SCP Foundation community, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the Anti-Harassment Team by sending a private message on Wikidot or [[[http://05command.wikidot.com/chat|Chat]]] to any of the following active members of the Anti-Harassment Team:

[[*user SoullessSingularity]] (Team Captain)
[[*user Decibelles]]
[[*user pig_catapult]]
[[*user Zyn]]
[[*user Dexanote]] (Administrative Contact)

If the person who is harassing you is on the team, they will not be allowed to participate in handling your incident.

We will respond to reports as promptly as we can.

If possible, please give a record of the behavior in question. This may include linking to comments, screenshots of comments, chat logs, or copies of private messages. This will help ensure action is taken.

This code of conduct applies to the SCP Foundation community, but if you are being harassed by a member of the site elsewhere, we still want to know about it. 

We reserve the right to reject any report that appears to be an attempt to abuse the harassment system for personal slights, revenge, pettiness, or to silence legitimate criticism.

We respect confidentiality for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, though usually only if punishment is deemed necessary. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.

+ Consequences

Participants asked to stop harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the Anti-Harassment Team may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including site and chat bans.

If a community member has been banned for harassment, they may only appeal their ban to the Anti-Harassment Team.

The Anti-Harassment Team will notify the Disciplinary Team upon recieving, investigating, and resolving a case. The following information will be available to the Disciplinary Team: 
* Date when the incident occurred.
* The number of parties involved in the incident.
* The nature of the incident. (e.g. sexual harassment, racially motivated harassment, etc.)
* The resolution as a summary, with any participants found to have been engaging in harassing behavior identified.
