[[tab General Policy On Harassment]]

+ This is the need-to-know version of our Harassment Policy. 
++++ The other tabs go into further detail and it is strongly recommended to read through them.
@@ @@
+++ Harassment is repeated unwanted interaction with a user, unless the case is based on sexuality, race, or gender. Any unwanted interaction with a user based on sexuality, race or gender is harassment.
* **If someone asks you to stop talking to them, stop.** Do not apologize. Do not demand a reason. Do not ask if you've been forgiven after a week. Stop talking to them entirely.

* **If someone is harassing you, tell them to stop.** Do not instigate further communication. Tell them to stop talking to you entirely. If they continue, take the screencap or logs of the event to a member of the Harassment Team.

* **If you witness someone harassing someone else, tell a member of the Harassment Team.** Do not try to get involved. Take the screencap or logs of the event to a member of the Harassment Team so they can deal with it.

+++ There is a zero-tolerance policy for harassment.
* **Harassment will be punished with a minimum of a temporary ban.** This includes staff members. There are no exceptions. There will be no warnings.

* **Off-site harassment is not an exception.** If off-site harassment occurs, staff members on the other site will also be notified.

+++ Reporting Harassment
* **All parties involved in a harassment case will be kept confidential.** Only staff on the Harassment Team will know the identities of those involved and will keep their identities secret.

* **Staff need some kind of record of the behavior in question.** This is preferably in the form of linking to comments, screenshots of comments, chat logs, private messages and anything else on the harassing behavior.

* **The person being harassed may rescind the complaint at any point up to the banning itself.** Staff will not unban members for harassment but will stop investigation if requested to by the recipient of the behavior in question.

* **Reports are to go to members of the Harassment Team.**  Members of the harassment team are at the bottom of this tab. You may send a harassment report to any team member you wish.

* **If the harassment occurred on the realtime chat, please contact the operators of the chat who are also part of the harassment team.** On-site staff do not have authority on chat matters unless they are also operators. On-site staff who are also operators on the realtime chat are [[user thedeadlymoose]], [[user SoullessSingularity]] (Soulless in chat), [[user TheDuckman]] (Bright in chat), [[user Photosynthetic]], [[user Sophia_Light]] (Light in chat), [[user pig_catapult]], and [[user Dexanote]].

+++  Banning And Appeals
* **A member who has been banned for harassment may appeal once.**  If a user's ban is lifted and they resume harassing behavior, they will be permanently banned without opportunity for appeal.

[[tab What Counts As Harassment?]]

This page is to give users a general idea of what does and does not count as harassment. These lists are general; they are neither exhaustive nor absolute. What behavior is considered harassment is ultimately to be decided by staff on a case-by-case basis. //If you are not sure if a situation is considered harassment, please consider contacting a member of the Harassment Team. There is no penalty for misreporting!//  [[footnote]] With exception of spamming reports, which will constitute as spam and be treated accordingly.[[/footnote]]

++++ **Behaviors That Are Considered Harassment:**
* Repeated replies to a specific user intending to elicit a specific negative reaction, especially after being told to stop.
* Being told to stop contacting the person, and then contacting them anyways, even if it's to apologize.
* Repeated private messages intending to elicit specific negative reaction, especially after being told to stop.
* Following a specific person off site and commenting or replying to off-site matters for on-site reasons.
* Requesting personal information off other members, especially unwarranted. This excludes the information required to apply and join the site.
* Private Messaging someone to insult, intimidate or other aggressive behavior.
* Any unwarranted and repeated aggressive comments or messages, including threats, insults, pressuring, and other methods of disturbance.
* Recruiting others to do any of the above, as well as being recruited to do any of the above.
* Other circumstances as judged by staff, as this is nowhere near an exhaustive list.

++++ **Behaviors That Are Not Considered Harassment:**
* Harsh critique that follows our [http://www.scp-wiki.net/criticism-policy criticism policy].
* Downvoting does not count as harassment unless confirmed malicious downvoting (as defined by downvoting for any reason aside from an individual article/tale's merits).
* Spam, unless for purposes stated above in the previous list. Spam will still be considered spam and discipline for spam will follow [http://www.scp-wiki.net/site-rules site rules].
* Disagreements in head-canon or writing style.
* Multiple comments made by different users on a specific flaw of an article, so long as these comments follow our [http://www.scp-wiki.net/criticism-policy criticism policy].
* Other circumstances as judged by staff, as this is nowhere near an exhaustive list.

[[tab What To Do When Witnessing Harassment]]
If you are a third party member witnessing harassment happening, it is important to maintain confidentiality and avoid mini-modding while also avoiding the bystander effect. The Harassment Team suggests the following when witnessing harassment.

# **Keep an account of the event(s).** This can be in the form of a screenshot, logs, or a link to the behavior if it can be witnessed on site. It is important to keep concrete records to report to the Harassment Team. Staff members cannot punish for harassment based on recounted events or statements that cannot be verified.
# **Report the event(s).** Please inform the Harassment Team. Staff cannot help put a stop to harassment if they are not aware that it is happening. Remember, there is no penalty for misreporting.
# **Keep confidentiality.** In order to keep the identities all parties involved confidential, it is important that you also maintain confidentiality. Please do not spread rumors or attempt to bring further attention to the event once you have reported it. Please do not take the opportunity to mini-mod (as defined by acting with disciplinary authority when a member lacks such authority) or harass the person you are reporting.
# **If you feel a banned person is continuing harassment through ban evasion or sockpuppeting, please follow the above steps.** Staff cannot help if they are not alerted to continued harassment. As before, evidence of harassment in the form of screenshots, links to comments, and anything else can be provided will be greatly appreciated.
# **If the harassment occurred on the realtime chat, please contact the operators of the chat.** On-site staff do not have authority on chat matters unless they are also operators. Staff members who deal with harassment who are also chat operators are [[user thedeadlymoose]], [[user SoullessSingularity]] (Soulless in chat), [[user TheDuckman]] (Bright in chat), [[user Photosynthetic]], [[user Sophia_Light]] (Light in chat), [[user pig_catapult]], and [[user Dexanote]].

[[tab What To Do When Harassed]]

Harassment is not to be tolerated on the site.  Please note the following guidelines as to what to do when being harassed. Any member who feels as if they are being harassed is encouraged to contact any of the staff members below.

# **If you feel you are being harassed, inform your harasser to stop and inform a staff member.** Staff cannot help you if they are not alerted to the harassing behavior. The staff members listed below are tasked to deal with harassment cases appropriately.
# **Please provide evidence of harassment in the form of screenshots, links to comments, private messages, and anything else that can be provided.** Staff members cannot punish for harassment based on recounted events or statements that cannot be verified. This is to avoid pitting two different accounts of an event against each other without any means to verify either.
# **If a specific staff member is harassing you, contact a different staff member, preferably one of a higher rank if possible.** Please do not do this simply because a decision on harassment was not in your favor.
# **If the harassment occurred on the realtime chat, please contact the operators of the chat.** On-site staff do not have authority on chat matters unless they are also operators. Staff members who deal with harassment who are also chat operators are [[user thedeadlymoose]], [[user SoullessSingularity]] (Soulless in chat), [[user TheDuckman]] (Bright in chat), [[user Photosynthetic]], [[user Sophia_Light]] (Light in chat), [[user pig_catapult]], and [[user Dexanote]].
# **If the harasser continues behavior through sockpuppeting or another means, please contact the staff.** Staff cannot help if they are not alerted to continued harassment. As before, evidence of harassment in the form of screenshots, links to comments, private messages, and anything else can be provided will be greatly appreciated. This is to avoid unverifiable accounts of any previous or continued harassment.
# **Staff can only cover online harassment related to the SCP Foundation.** Any offline harassment should be dealt with by local authorities. SCP Foundation staff do not have the authority on other sites as they do here and cannot deal with harassment on other sites unrelated to the SCP Foundation. The only exception to this would be in the case of off-site harassment as defined by following a specific person off site and commenting or replying to off-site matters for on-site reasons.

[[tab What To Do When Disciplined For Harassment]]

If you have been banned for harassment but feel you have been unfairly banned, please contact one of the staff members tasked to deal with harassment cases. As cases are kept confidential except for these specific staff, other staff members may not be able to help you. Please be aware of the following guidelines when contacting staff.

# **Do not contact the person you may have been harassing.** Doing this will immediately remove all opportunity for any appeal to the ban. Do not message them for any reason, including apologizing or desire to discuss issues and reach mutual understanding. The best to be done to express your respect and non-malicious intent is to avoid contacting the person you may have harassed.
# **You can only appeal once.** If a member has been banned before for harassment, they do not have the opportunity to appeal.
# **You are entitled to know you have been banned for harassing others.** You are also allowed to respond to the discipline in the form of an appeal.
