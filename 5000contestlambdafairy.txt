**Item №:** SCP-5000

[[include component:image-block-base name=http://scpdsandbox.wdfiles.com/local--files/lambda-fairy-j/bush.jpg|caption=The SCP-5000 settlement, as seen at midday. Click to enlarge.|width=240px|align=right|link="http://scpdsandbox.wdfiles.com/local--files/lambda-fairy-j/bush-large.jpg"]]

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** An electric fence has been built around the territory containing SCP-5000. Trespassers are to be captured (by non-lethal means if possible), amnesticized, and released.

For their own safety, personnel must stay at least 50 meters away from the center of the SCP-5000 settlement.

**Description:** SCP-5000 is a group of --8-- --16-- approximately 96 humanoid entities located near Kennedys Bush, New Zealand. The entities range from 1.3 to 1.7 meters tall, and have blue skin and blond or red hair. They are nocturnal; their settlements and artifacts emerge spontaneously during dusk and disappear during dawn. They can coordinate and use tools, are capable of fluent speech (in English and Māori), and have mild ontokinetic abilities. It is believed that the //patupaiarehe// (fairies) of Māori folklore correspond to SCP-5000.

In November 1998, security personnel observed an uptick in SCP-5000 activity. Neighboring civilians have filed noise complaints, and a majority of the trees in the area have been chopped down. Dr Linda Fourier was sent to investigate.

**SCP-5000-1:** Always happy to answer! Dr Fourier, we're making a startup. Kereru. //Dot com//.

**Fourier:** Okay. //[Pauses to take notes.]// So what does Kereru, uh, dot com, create?

**SCP-5000-1:** Oh, you know... the usual. Disrupting the market with our secret sauce. Building tomorrow, today. Synergy. It's a paradigm shift—we have to take it to the next level, strike while the iron is hot.

In the center of the settlement, the SCP-5000 entities have formed a stack of woven flax sheets. When a sheet is removed, reality in a ~ 25 meter radius is reset to the time when the sheet was added to the pile. This effect includes the SCP-5000 themselves, who have often been duplicated or destroyed through its activation.

The SCP-5000 entities dig a shallow pit and fill it with wooden planks and sticks, in an apparent attempt to light a fire. After a few tries, they succeed; they scream and scatter from the pit, leaving the fire behind.

The SCP-5000 instances tear down the //[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whakairo whakairo]//[[footnote]]Traditional Māori wood carving.[[/footnote]] ornaments from their homes and throw them into the fire.

**Fourier:** How's it going today?

**SCP-5000-2:** Very well. Our decoupled monolith architecture has allowed us to scale to the next billion users with six nines.

**SCP-5000-1:** Sounds great, Ana! Bill Gates would be proud of you.

**SCP-5000-2:** //[Smiles.]// Thank you.

**Fourier:** Bill Gates?

**SCP-5000-1:** Oh, he's one of the people we look up to. You know, like Robert Levitan[[footnote]]Founder of Flooz, an online currency //(defunct)//.[[/footnote]] or Greg McLemore[[footnote]]Founder of Pets.com, an online pet supply store //(defunct)//.[[/footnote]] or Michael Fenne[[footnote]]Founder of Pixelon, an online video distributor //(defunct)//.[[/footnote]]--

**SCP-5000-3:** Heroes.

**Fourier:** I see.

**SCP-5000-1:** And one day, it'll be our names on that list as well.

//[SCP-5000-1 turns around to face the other SCP-5000 entities.]//

**SCP-5000-1:** Isn't that right, everyone!?

//[The SCP-5000 entities raise their hands and yell in acknowledgement. SCP-5000-1 turns back around, and grins.]//

**SCP-5000-1:** That's the spirit.

The SCP-5000 entities, led by SCP-5000-2, begin to construct a wooden tower over the fire pit. As expected, it starts to burn; however, rather than attempting to put out the fire, SCP-5000-2 commands them to build further. Eventually, the structure collapses and the entities all disappear into the pit.

The next night, the SCP-5000 entities emerge from the surrounding bush—apparently unharmed. They restart construction in the same location as before.

Through trial and error, the SCP-5000 entities have learned to use the flax sheets to create more of themselves. There are now 16 instances of SCP-5000.

**Fourier:** Can I ask you guys a question?

**Fourier:** Why did you decide to start a tech company? I'm sure there are many other things you could have done instead.

**SCP-5000-1:** Well... you've been watching us the whole time right?

**Fourier:** That would be the case, yes.

**SCP-5000-1:** So you've seen how much we've changed. From some backwater village in the middle of nowhere, to--

The SCP-5000 entities realize that they cannot continue building the tower upward, as the space is obstructed by an overhanging cliff. SCP-5000-1 and SCP-5000-2 spend the next hour arguing over what to do next, before SCP-5000-3—unbeknownst to the others—pushes the whole structure out from under the overhang. Miraculously, the tower remains standing. The argument stops, and the entities resume construction.

A growing number of SCP-5000 entities have been dying in occupational accidents. This effect has caused the SCP-5000 population to stabilize at ~ 96.

A group of five SCP-5000 entities suddenly stop work, lay down their tools, and gather in the center of the settlement. A brief silence passes before one of the entities bends over, its head oriented upward, and begins to rhythmically pull the straps on its shoes while yelling: "Haere! Haere! Haere!" [[footnote]]"Farewell! Farewell! Farewell!"[[/footnote]] The other four entities follow, pulling and yelling, and soon the group would lift off the ground and disappear into the night sky.

The remaining instances do not react to this incident.

The remaining SCP-5000 entities complete the tower. They gather around the structure and rejoice through song and dance.

During the celebration, a juvenile SCP-5000 instance inadvertently runs into a wooden post, dislodging it and causing the tower to collapse.

The tower catches fire. It collapses; due to its excessive height, it falls outward and spreads the fire to surrounding bush. The SCP-5000 entities panic and run around the settlement, further propagating the blaze.

Eventually, the fire reaches the stack of flax sheets, which bursts into a column of flame. As the flax burns, the SCP-5000 instances and their artifacts warp and stretch—causing the entities great distress—before disappearing altogether. By dawn, the flax has burned completely; its ash is the only remaining evidence of SCP-5000.

Neutralized classification pending.
