**Item #:** SCP-2431

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2431 is to be kept in a standard cell incubator at 37 C when not in use. Work with the anomaly should take place in a sealed, sterile, tissue culture hood under normal BSL-2 conditions. Research personnel should avoid direct physical contact with SCP-2431. Excess SCP-2431 should be disposed of using advanced prion sterilization techniques.

**Description:** SCP-2431 is a misfolded cellular protein, ATP synthase[[footnote]] The protein primarily responsible for generation of ATP in the electron transport chain within mitochondria, with similar structural and functional components across all domains.[[/footnote]], which form large, oily and viscous aggregates, 5-78 g in mass. SCP-2431 is capable of spontaneous replication, regardless of whether or not correctly folded ATP synthase variants are present, and will produce new misfolded proteins every 2 weeks when kept at 37 C. Upon reaching 78 g in mass, aggregate piles will split into 15 new aggregates, and begin the process again.

Every 30 minutes, SCP-2431 aggregates will randomly fold and intertwine in a fashion similar to origami. Random folding occurs by the aggregate reaccumulating into a single large clump before flattening out into a square or rectangle and folding. This entire process usually takes only a matter of seconds. How and why this occurs is not currently understood, however; X-ray crystallography of single SCP-2431 manifestations has pinpointed several anomalous structural additions that may be involved (See addendum 1[[footnote]]Due to coding errors and conflicts with biological terminology, access to Addendum 1 currently requires navigation to a separate page and level 4 research credentials. Please scroll to the bottom of this document and click the red text that reads "comments". Addendum 1 will be attached to the topmost entry.[[/footnote]]). 

When an aggregate of SCP-2431 refolds into a new shape, it will begin exhibiting characteristics of the item, organism, or person it is imitating. This often involves generating movement, auditory stimuli, and odors congruent with the shape. When exposed to images or origami constructs of an item, organism, or person, aggregates will refold to emulate the presented item[[footnote]] This occurs despite a lack of visual sensory equipment. Foundation researchers currently believe individual aggregates may have some sort of rudimentary nervous system in place through slightly altered variants of the misfolded protein. Research on techniques to explore this possibility are ongoing. [[/footnote]].  (See Experiment log E-2431-01). 

Aggregates exhibit a rudimentary form of shared sapience between instances, often refolding into items or shapes as a means of communication. In some cases, SCP-2431 may develop an emotional attachment to research personnel that interact with them regularly. This is often exhibited in the form of refolding into items, animals, or persons that elicit a positive emotional response from the attending personnel. 

Direct contact with cells or tissue of any nature initiates the refolding and modification of ATP synthases into further SCP-2431 instances in a cell to cell progression (For a mechanism of how this occurs, please see Addendum 1). Accumulation of SCP-2431 instances in each cell occurs at 10,000 times the normal rate of prion protein aggregation due to the presence of enhanced refolding mechanisms (See addendum 1). When enough misfolded protein accumulates, SCP-2431 instances will drill out of the cell and into a new non-infected cell, propagating the process. 

In mid to late stages of infection, individuals will complain of intense muscular pain, and formation of distended lumps beneath the skin. 

In extreme late stages of infection, individuals will experience inappropriate bending of limbs, muscle spasms, tissue and organ rearrangement, withdrawal of pre-existing limbs and emergence of new ones, and loss of motor control.

**Discovery:** SCP-2431 was discovered by a research team emerging from [[[SCP-2378]]]. Approximately 3000 aggregate piles were scattered in the forest surrounding the structures entrance, and were folded into a variety of different shapes. All instances were secured for study and characterization. 

On January 3rd, 2013, the individual linked to SCP-2378 at the time of SCP-2431 discovery, Mr. Aiko Adachi, was diagnosed with Creutzfeldt–Jakob's disease. Based on SCP-2431's behavior since 5/3/2013, it is currently believed that Mr. Adachi is physically linked to all SCP-2431 instances. How or why this is possible is not understood at this time.

//The following section is composed of the condensed and summarized results of all experiments with SCP-2431.//

All aggregates exposed to images were measured to be at a mass of 78 g.

//Experiment 1//

**Date:** March 3rd 2013
**Researcher:** Research Assistant Bates
**Photograph/Origami construct:** One [[[SCP-1762|SCP-1762-2]]] Instance
**Number of Aggregates:** 2
**Result:** Aggregates split into 30 new instances, and began refolding process. Upon completion, instances had refolded into origami dragons of varying size and color. Instances began flying around the tissue culture hood emitting auditory calls commonly associated with mythical dragons, and emitting small sparks of light. 

//Experiment 5//

**Date:** May 5th, 2013
**Researcher:** Research Assistant Bates
**Photograph/Origami construct:** A paper //Panthera tigris altaica//
**Number of Aggregates:** 5
**Result:** Aggregates split into 75 new instances, all 75 instances refolded into origami tigers, exhibiting vocal calls and movement consistent with //Panthera tigris altaica//. 

//Experiment 6//

**Date:** June 3rd, 2013
**Researcher:** Research Assistant Bates
**Photograph/Origami construct:** An image of Aiko Adachi in bed with his wife and two children, followed by placing several images from one of Mr. Adachi's published works, including a story regarding the legend of 1000 paper cranes[[footnote]] Japanese legend holds that if a person creates 1,000 paper cranes they will be granted one wish by the gods.[[/footnote]] inside the hood.
**Number of Aggregates:** 3
**Result:** Aggregates split into 45 new instances, 42 instances refolded into the a shape similar to that of an origami crane and began to emit vocalizations and movement similar to //Grus japonensis//. The remaining 3 instances refolded into origami numbers, reading 9, 5, and 8. 


//Experiment 7//

**Date:** July 5th 2013
**Researcher:** Research Assistant Bates
**Photograph/Origami construct:** One origami iteration of a Boeing B-17 bomber. 
**Number of Aggregates:** 20
**Result:** Aggregates split into 300 new instances, 150 of which refolded into extremely detailed recreations of an origami B-17. Instances proceeded to travel along the length of the tissue culture hood, and ascend into the air, flying in formation reminiscent of American Air raids in the European theater of World War 2. Instances were observed dropping small folded constructs similar to bombs which shattered into tiny protein fragments on contact with the surface of the tissue culture hood.

147 instances refolded into the shape of a crane, as seen in the previous experiment. The remaining 3 instances refolded into numbers, reading 8, 1, and 1.

------
Over the next 4 months an increasing number of SCP-2431 aggregates refused to refold into any shape other than that of a crane. 

//Experiment 15//

**Date:** November 7th, 2013
**Researcher:** Research Assistant Bates
**Photograph/Origami construct:** A photograph of Notre Dame de Paris
**Number of Aggregates:** 10
**Result:** Aggregates split into 150 new instances. 147 instances refolded, as demonstrated previously, into a shape similar to that of a crane. The remaining 3 instances refolded into the numbers 0, 0, and 0. 

Further attempts at testing with SCP-2431 following experiment 15 have resulted in aggregate instances refolding into human shapes resembling the Japanese deity Fukurokuju[[footnote]]One of the Seven lucky gods in Japanese, usually associated with longevity. He is frequently depicted with Cranes and Turtles.[[/footnote]]. As of 12/05/2013 testing is suspended until further notice.
