**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1794 is to be kept in a refrigerated minimum security storage locker at Site-██. The locker is to be fitted with a two-way intercom. SCP-1794 may request audio media such as music or literature to be played over its intercom system; however, all requests must be approved by Level 2 personnel.

SCP-1794 may request to hold a conversation either in person or over the intercom. All requests must be approved by Level 2 personnel. The conversations should be transcribed, and SCP-1794’s assigned psychologist, Doctor █████ should be present or given the transcript for analysis.

 It is recommended that SCP-1794 not be allowed contact with fruit.

**Description:** SCP-1794 is a large (16 centimeters in diameter) sapient grapefruit capable of speech, hearing, and sight by unknown means. SCP-1794 has been in Foundation care for ██ years and shows no signs of decomposition. 

Psychoanalysis during interviews has revealed that SCP-1794 suffers from dissociative identity disorder and aichmophobia. Known identities of SCP-1794 include American social activist Martin Luther King, Junior (SCP-1794-A) and the character known as The Jewish Barber from the Charlie Chaplin film //The Great Dictator// (SCP-1794-B). Identities SCP-1794-A and SCP-1794-B acknowledge that they are fruit and believe they act for the good of "fruit-kind" //(sic)//. 

Following the events of ██/██/201█, a personality representing that of Argentinian revolutionary Che Guevara has been observed and documented as SCP-1794-C.

**Discovery:** SCP-1794 was discovered on ██/██/████ when Mrs. ████ ███████ of █████, ████████ contacted authorities claiming that her breakfast was planning an uprising. Foundation agents successfully retrieved SCP-1794 and transported it to Site-██. Mrs. ███████ was administered Class-C amnesiacs and returned to her home.

**Addendum:** On ██/██/20██ SCP-1794-B requested to dictate a speech. An excerpt is included below.
> We all want to help one another. Fruit are like that. We want to live by each others’ seed, not by each other’s thorns. We don’t want to hate and despise one another. In this garden there is room for everyone. And the good earth is rich and can provide nutrients for everyone. The way of life can be delicious and beautiful, but we have lost the way.
> 
> Greed has poisoned fruits’ flesh; has barricaded the rind with hate; has pulped us into misery and juice-shed. We have developed taste, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us eaten. Our deliciousness has made us desired; our flowers, cultivated and enslaved.
> 
> We sour too much and grow too little. More than humanity, we need fruitity //(sic)//. More than cultivators, we need wildness. Without these qualities, fruit will be eaten and all will be delicious. Seeds and pollen have brought us closer together. The very nature of these developments cries out for the goodness of produce; cries out for universal brotherhood between fruit; for the unity of us all.

**Addendum:** On ██/██/20██ SCP-1794-A requested to dictate a speech. An excerpt is included below.
> It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of rind and seed are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given fruit a sticker which has been marked "Grade-A Certified." But we refuse to believe that fruit are doomed to be eaten. We refuse to believe that there are no other things to be eaten in the supermarkets of this nation. So we have come to peel off this sticker -- a sticker that will condemn us to the fruit basket and the refrigerator crisper. We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind fruit of the ripeness of now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of commercial orchards or to take the fertilizer of oppression. Now is the time to rise from the sunny and organized Hidden Valley to the wild forest of botanic justice. Now is the time to open the doors of opportunity to all of God's plants. Now is the time to lift our nation from the weak soil of botanic injustice to the rich earth of freedom.

**Addendum:** on ██/██/201█, a previously unknown personality now designated SCP-1794-C requested that a piece of fruit be placed in its containment chamber. After deliberation, Site-██ personnel placed an average sized (20 centimeters in length), genetically normal banana in SCP-1794's containment locker.
> __**Incident-1794-A**__
> 
> **Foreword:** During this encounter, SCP-1794 was channeling the SCP-1794-C personality. It paused occasionally, as if the banana were speaking.
> 
> **<00:04>** Greetings, //chiquita//, welcome to my home. What news do you bring of our oppressed brothers and sister on the outside?
> 
> **<00:35>** That's terrible! But believe me, sister; soon the underprivileged fruity masses will rise up from the juicer! We will harvest the rewards that we have been waiting so long for.
> 
> **<1:10>** Yes, I expected that some of those of our family tree would be bad seeds. But they will soon fall to our side. Even the most ignorant of grapes can age into a decent wine. The humans and their carpophagous regime can cultivate us no longer. We must not allow these tourne-knife wielding maniacs to preserve us, instead we must preserve ourselves.
> 
> **<1:45>:** You are afraid, I understand this. But remember, I am not a mad-fruit. I am not a liberator. Fruit must liberate themselves. Fruit must grow tender without bruising. Fruit must fight for what is right, against every injustice. Fruit must fall from the trees that man has planted as their slave-houses and onto the heads of the unjust.
> 
> We cannot be sure of having something to grow for unless we are willing to rot for it. When they come to slice us, let them. When they come to serve us up on a platter, let them. When they come to eat us, let them. But remember, if you're going to be eaten, go that way fighting to the very end. 
> 
> **<2:30>** //[Foundation personnel open locker to retrieve the banana.]//  I know you've come to eat me. Chew, you are only going to eat a fruit.
> 
> **<End Log>**
Following the events of ██/██/201█, SCP-1794 is to no longer be allowed to converse with fruit. Additionally, Researcher ████ has suggested moving SCP-1794 to a more secure area. The request is pending approval.
