[[span class="h-span"]]**Item #:**[[/span]] SCP-3070

[[span class="h-span"]]**Object Class:**[[/span]] Euclid

[[span class="h-span"]]**Special Containment Procedures:**[[/span]] Foundation assets within the International Astronomical Union and its Minor Planet Center are to monitor name choices for newly discovered minor planets. Changes to the names of any minor planet require Level 4/3070 authorization. Foundation [[[SCP-2813|orbital ]]] [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/first55|task forces]]] and satellites will routinely monitor cataloged minor planets, though the existence of approximately 460,000 such objects prevents full monitoring.

All SCP-3070-A that manifest are to be retrieved by Orbital Task Force ञ-12 ("Little Princes"). Following analysis, objects may either be stored at Heliocentric Area-16 or destroyed following Level 4/3070 personnel review.

[[span class="h-span"]]**Description:**[[/span]] SCP-3070 is a phenomenon affecting minor planets[[footnote]] Astronomical objects orbiting a star that cannot be classified as a planet or comet. This includes dwarf planets, asteroids, and trojans, centaurs, Kuiper belt objects, and other trans-Neptunian objects.[[/footnote]] orbiting the sun that have been categorized by the International Astronomical Union's Minor Planet Center -- primarily those designated with a number and a name. The phenomenon causes objects (designated SCP-3070-A) related to the minor planet's IAU designation to manifest either in orbit[[footnote]] This may even occur in scenarios where the minor planet lacks a strong enough gravitational field to allow orbits to form around it.[[/footnote]] or on the surface of the body. This manifestation has never been directly observed. Instances of SCP-3070-A display various anomalous properties while on or orbiting the minor planet; these properties cease after relocation.

Currently 437 minor planets have been affected by SCP-3070. No minor planets have been affected twice.

> **Minor Planet:** 262419 Suzaka
> **3070-A Discovery Date:** 15-September-2013
> 
> **Description:** 1:1000 scale limestone models of all buildings present in Suzaka, Japan were orbiting the asteroid in a single ring formation.

> **Minor Planet:** 1981 Midas
> **3070-A Discovery Date:** 29-October-2013
> 
> **Description:** 288 golden conical pillars (91cm long and 23mm wide at the base) were embedded on the asteroid's surface, forming 4 concentric dodecagons.

> **Minor Planet:** 399979 Lewseaman
> **3070-A Discovery Date:** 10-July-2013
> 
> **Description:** Three bronze cylinders (14m wide and 19cm wide) displaying the logo of General Electrics on each end were embedded on the minor planet's surface.

> **Minor Planet:** 124192 Moletai
> **3070-A Discovery Date:** 17-May-2014
> 
> **Description:** A 1:50 scale replica of the Molėtai Astronomical Observatory, made of the same materials as the asteroid, was following a rapidly changing elliptical orbit around the body. The SCP-3070-A instance collided with 124192 Moletai and was destroyed as recovery efforts began.

> **Minor Planet:** 495827
> **3070-A Discovery Date:** 4-December-2016
> 
> **Description:** 168 renditions of the number 495827 were inscribed on the astronomical body's surface, written in differing fonts and sizes.

> **Minor Planet:** 882 Swetlana
> **3070-A Discovery Date:** 9-December-2016
> 
> **Description:** Six 100m-tall and 2m-wide pillars of deceased //Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda//[[footnote]] The Mangrove horseshoe crab.[[/footnote]] were connected to the asteroid. The legs of each cadaver were fused to those of the bodies around it.
> 
> **Note:** No explanation of 882 Swetlana's name is known.

> **Minor Planet:** 54439 Topeka
> **3070-A Discovery Date:** 12-December-2016
> 
> **Description:** 233,870 tendrils of assorted eye tissue, each of differing length (maximum of 24m), extended from asteroid. Genetic tests of a sample of the tendrils suggested that each one correlated to a resident of Topeka, Kansas during the time of the 2010 United States Census. All tendrils dissolved on 17-December-2016.

> **Minor Planet:** 672 Astarte
> **3070-A Discovery Date:** 21-December-2016
> 
> **Description:** 12 rings of a fluid composed of human egg cells, liquid carbon dioxide, and //Panthera leo bleyenberghi//[[footnote]] The Southwest African lion.[[/footnote]] blood were orbiting the minor planet. The fluids froze and dispersed after two days. Genetic analysis of the blood revealed the presence of chemicals similar to DNA, possessing six base pairs and three strands. The function of the chemicals (temporarily designated C-3070) is unknown.

> **Minor Planet:** 1996 Adams
> **3070-A Discovery Date:** 1-December-2017
> 
> **Description:** Twelve cadavers resembling John Couch Adams[[footnote]] A deceased British mathematician and astronomer.[[/footnote]] at the time of his death were found connected to the minor planet by 3m-long umbilical cords. Each was found wearing attire typical of the late 1800s. The cadavers and cords experienced the symptoms of space exposure when cut.

> **Minor Planet:** 1991 Darwin
> **3070-A Discovery Date:** 11-January-2018
> 
> **Description:** 24 //Chelonoidis nigra abingdonii//[[footnote]] An extinct species of Galápagos tortoise.[[/footnote]] were observed to be alive and actively moving across the surface of the asteroid. Relocation resulted in death. Surgery performed on the cadavers revealed that each lacked internal organs and skeletal structure, and instead had a severed head resembling either Charles Darwin or George Darwin within the body, connected to the limbs and neck via bundles of nerve tissue extending from the neck. C-3070 was found within cadaver cells, having replaced all DNA.

[[span class="h-span"]]**Addendum.2 - SCP-3070-1:**[[/span]]

On 10-January-2018, janitorial staff working at the IAU headquarters in Paris, France, discovered an anomaly (designated SCP-3070-1) embedded in the walls of the building. SCP-3070-1 is a combination of metal tubes (some composed of exo-planetary metals), assorted human tissues from varying body parts, cybernetic organs, and devices resembling television antennae. Analysis of tissues found large quantities of C-3070, which have been observed to act as a DNA analogue, and human DNA matching all IAU members.

Several of SCP-3070-1's tubes are attached to a 2018 Macbook Pro laptop, which is partially connected to a column of white matter and cardiac muscle. The laptop is powered on at all times, and has full internet and IAU database access. On multiple occasions prior to the discovery of a new SCP-3070-A instance, text will appear on the laptop screen for varying periods of time. Below is a transcript of text displayed on 12-January-2018.

As SCP-3070-1 extends through a majority of the building, the anomaly cannot be relocated without potential structural damage. Undercover agents have been assigned to monitor the anomaly and minimize civilian exposure to it. Full containment procedures are in development. Research by the [[[SCP-287|Exobiology Department]]] is underway.
