**Special Containment Procedures:** Provisional Site-1538 has been built over SCP-5577's work area in ██████, Turkey, under the guise of an archaeological excavation. Personnel are authorized to detain trespassers, and prescribe amnestics in the event of unauthorized entry.  

Security personnel are to relay all notable vocalizations from SCP-5577 to assigned research staff.

**Description:** SCP-5577 is a sentient humanoid skeleton, standing at about 160 cm. The subject is believed to be between 8,000 and 5,000 years old, and shows considerable deviation from baseline human anatomy. They are constantly engaged in metalworking, and have never been observed to cease activity for any reason, except in case of injury (See Addendum 5577.01).

SCP-5577-1 is a blacksmith's workshop, built into the cavern where SCP-5577 was found. SCP-5577-1 is fully furnished with a hearth and cooling tank, an anvil and other tools and amenities for metalworking. Several tools used by SCP-5577 have no readily understood purpose, but have shown a variety of anomalous effects

SCP-5577-2 is a set of objects created by SCP-5577. There is no consistent quality to these objects, except for their origin and composition, which consists of materials produced via SCP-5577-1. Some possess unknown anomalous properties, while most do not. Invariably, these are themselves used as material for further objects, which will likewise be recycled.

To date, no instance of SCP-5577-2 has gone more than three weeks without being incorporated into another object, with one exception (See SCP-5577-P). 

[[collapsible show="Known Examples of SCP-5577-2:" hide="Hide Notes"]]
||~ Designation ||~ Description ||~ Notes ||
|| SCP-5577-A || Nondescript iron ingots. No observed anomalous properties. || By far, the most common instance of SCP-5577-2 produced. SCP-5577-A is withdrawn one ingot at a time from a large chest within SCP 5577-1. ||
|| SCP-5577-B || Nondescript leather strips, measuring between 15 cm and 85 cm. No observed anomalous properties. || The second most common instance of SCP-5577-2 produced. Large sheets of raw leather are produced in the same manner as SCP-5577-A, then cut to size. Produced leather is always black, and corresponds to no known animal. ||
|| SCP-5577-C || Various replacement tools and parts for SCP-5577-1. Most display no anomalous properties, except for unnatural durability. A small minority of produced tools are known to have anomalous qualities (see SCP-5577-G). || Despite unnatural durability, tools produced in this manner are under constant usage, and last approx. three months, on average. SCP-5577 has been known to dedicate large blocks of time solely to repair and replace equipment. ||
|| SCP-5577-G || Various iron implements and objects. Observed instances have mild cognitohazardous effects, most commonly described as an 'inability to forget' instances. || On January 16, 2014, SCP-5577 produced upwards of 200 iron arrowheads, using freshly-created examples of SCP-5577-C (all of which would go on to display similar cognitohazardous properties). Arrowheads produced in this manner appeared in dreams to site staff for the next two weeks. ||
|| SCP-5577-P || Glowing white dust. Observed interaction with SCP-5577 suggests incredibly high mass. || On Sept. 27, 2015, SCP-5577 began pounding a single iron ingot non-stop. This continued for three weeks, at the end of which the remaining iron filings and dust began to glow dimly. This glow increased in luminosity for several days. SCP-5577-P was then forged into a needle-like object measuring 108 cm. This is the sole object created by SCP-5577 that has remained unincorporated into another instance of SCP-5577-2. ||
|| SCP-5577-Q || Large wooden platform, inscribed with pentagram. || On Oct 18, 2015, several created objects were assembled in the center of SCP-5577-Q by SCP-5577, who then began shouting and chanting in an unknown language for a period of five minutes, before returning to their usual activity. Several hours later, all assembled objects disappeared. They would later reappear as motifs and subjects in the off-duty personal sketches of Junior Researcher Diego McKenna. Experimentation and interviews with other artistically-inclined site staff revealed that objects placed within SCP-5577-Q will disappear from physical reality, and emerge in local psycho-space. ||
|| SCP-5577-AB || Thick, viscous fluid, observed to glow dull crimson. || Produced by subjecting stone taken from SCP-5577-1's walls to incredible pressure, via several previously unseen devices. When introduced to SCP-5577-1's hearth, its fire began producing no observable flames. This quality persisted for a period of one week, during which SCP-5577 was observed engaging in its usual activity, but using absolutely no visible raw materials. Observed interaction with SCP-5577 suggests materials heated by flames modified via SCP-5577-AB do not simply become invisible, but rather exist in some non-physical space. ||

**Addendum 5577.01:**  

> **Interviewed:** SCP-5577 
> 
> **Interviewer:** Dr. Gonzalo Gonzalez, Lead Researcher for SCP-5577
> 
> **Foreword:** On July 19, 2020, security at Provisional Site-1538 heard the usual sounds of blacksmithing cease, and SCP-5577 began to shout in an unidentified Kartvelian language (currently believed to be Hattic). Upon investigation, security personnel discovered SCP-5577 in physical distress, clutching its hand. Medical personnel were summoned, and given authorization to assist SCP-5577 in treating what it later described as an accidentally self-inflicted wound. Treatment consisted of using cyanoacrylate adhesive to repair a fractured metacarpal. 
>
>Following treatment and attempts at communication, SCP-5577 acquiesced to the following interview, conducted in Sanskrit with the assistance an interpreter. It has been translated for ease of access to researchers.
> 
> **<Begin Log>**
>
> **SCP-5577:** Hope glue works. Gotta keep at it.
> 
> **Dr. Gonzalez:** Keep at your work, I'm assuming?
> 
> **SCP-5577:** Aye. Can't stop now. Almost done, y'see?
> 
> [SCP-5577 gestures to its surroundings.]
> 
> **Dr. Gonzalez:** Sure, yeah.
> 
> **SCP-5577:** Y'don't see. No problem. Others'll see. They'll thank me, y'know?
> 
> **Dr. Gonzalez:** Who are you expecting?
> 
> **SCP-5577:** You. Your people. Doctors, priests, mages. Warriors. You'll come here, once I'm done. You'll thank me. You'll take what I built, finally gimme some space. 
> 
> **Dr. Gonzalez:** What is it you're building?
> 
> **SCP-5577:** Weapon.
> 
> **Dr. Gonzalez:** For who?
> 
> **SCP-5577:** Well, not weapon. No word for it anymore. Sea Peoples had a word, though.
> 
> [Dr. Gonzalez looks confused for a moment.]
> 
> **Dr. Gonzalez:** Sea People...  Did they ride horses? And come down from the north?
> 
> **SCP-5577:** Aye, aye! Sea People had a word, and 'twas like weapon, but also like tool. 'Twas something you did, and something you held. 
> 
> **Dr. Gonzalez:** And who is this... weapon... for?
> 
> **SCP-5577:** Anyone who can hold it. Gotta be strong, but also focused. Slips through hands, y'see? And also through minds.
> 
> **Dr. Gonzalez:** So it has both physical and metaphysical properties... And what is the weapon to be used against?
> 
> **SCP-5577:** [REDACTED]
> 
> **Dr. Gonzalez:** I don't follow... That can't be possible, otherwise we'd have contained her.
> 
> **SCP-5577:** She's not born yet. Parents aren't born yet. Parents' parents aren't born yet, but she's still coming, so I'm still working.
> 
> **Dr. Gonzalez:** What else do you know? Besides how to kill it, I mean.
> 
> **SCP-5577:** Don't know how to kill her. That's for warriors to figure out. Generals, mages. They'll know. Just building what they'll need. Don't know much else.
> 
> **Dr. Gonzalez:** You must at least know what she's capable of, otherwise how could you build?
> 
> [Both are silent for a moment.]
> 
> **SCP-5577:** I know one thing. She eats the Way.
> 
> **Dr. Gonzalez:** She 'eats' ways?
> 
> **SCP-5577:** //The// Way. And the Road. The Wheel. The Instructions. The Cosmic Laws, the General Order of Things. Them Sea Peoples had a word for it. //Dharma.//
> 
> **Dr. Gonzalez:** Wait... Hang on, the //Dharma//?
> 
> **SCP-5577:** Hrm, good word! Yes, she eats Dharma. Drinks it down, like blood from God's own throat. She'll drink the Dharma, and when she's done, there'll be nothing left.
> 
> **<End Log>**
> 
> **Closing Statement:** SCP-5577 was unable to answer further questions about this entity, and declined to answer questions about itself, citing a need to continue working. Furthermore, SCP-5577 declined to allow Foundation to personnel to test any of its equipment or materials, citing their importance to its work. 
> 
> SCP-5577 has refused all interviews since, citing a need to continue "until the Work is done."
