**Item #:** SCP-885-J

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** At present, the source of SCP-885-J cannot be contained. However, individual instances of SCP-885-J may be temporarily prevented by enactment of Protocol Lambda-8 ("Locking Researcher Jacobs Out Of The Site 13 The Break Room") or Delta-9 ("Leaving Jacobs' Dirty Dishes On His Desk"). In the event of Protocol Zeta-4 ("Jacobs Cleaning Up After Himself Like A Human Fucking Being"), SCP-885-J is to be considering neutralized. However, this eventuality is seen as being highly unlikely.

**Description:** SCP-885-J is a phenomenon that occurs following Researcher ██████ Jacobs preparation food in the Site 13 break room. Regardless of the food prepared, a large number of dishes[[footnote]]Usually three, but instances involving up to seven dishes have been observed[[/footnote]] will be left uncleaned in the break room sink. Unlike normal dishes produced by someone who has a concept of responsibility and not expecting everyone else to clean up after them like they're eight years old, these dishes will go uncleaned for an indefinite period of time, usually between one to three days, before other Foundation personnel grow tired of looking at them and clean the dishes themselves.

**Addendum 885-J-e34:** As of ██/██/20██, Researcher Jacobs has acquiesced to the requests of his hippie girlfriend to begin "eating right." Incidences of smelly-ass herbal teas, weird pastes, and vegetable scraps have begun to manifest in instances of SCP-885-J. As a result, Site 13 break room has become infested with fruit flies. Reclassification to Keter pending. 

**Researcher Note 885-J-s02:** //Which one of you assholes did this? You should have asked me instead of making this bullshit. Also, don't talk shit about Susan, you passive-aggressive fucks.// - Researcher Jacobs
