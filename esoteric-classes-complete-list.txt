title:A Comprehensive List of Esoteric Classes
[[>]]
[[module Rate]]
[[/>]]

[[f>toc title="Sections"]]
The Foundation's primary directive is to order the anomalous by designating instances with four-digit numbers and methods of containment. One of the tools used to accomplish this is the Object Class, a process of parsing anomalies into groups based on the difficulty of containment. [[[Object Classes | Full dossiers are available for archivists wishing to familiarize themselves.]]]

Despite this, some anomalies warrant entirely new object classes beyond the standard Safe, Euclid, and Keter, and sometimes even beyond Thaumiel, Neutralized, and Explained. These Esoteric Classes are exceedingly rare, and many are not viable for standard documentation due to their specialized natures. The following lists serve as a collection of these classes.

+++* A Guide For Contributors [[size 80%]](Please read before editing!)[[/size]]
[[collapsible show="[+] Unfold Editorial Guide [+]" hide="[-] Fold Editorial Guide [-]"]]
Given that additions to this guide are manual, it's very likely that some classes will slip through the cracks. If you have information on a class being improperly labeled in this guide, you can update it as appropriate!

------

++++* How to Edit
In order to change something, scroll down to "Edit" button at the bottom of the page and open the edit window. **Please list a description of changes made in the "Short description of changes:" window.** If you don't, expect a private message from [[*user Nagiros]] to clarify changes.

Also, don't correct the typo in Scarf's definition; it's intentional.

++++* Adding New Classes
Here's the code for an entry; place it alphabetically in the appropriate section.
[[=]]
[[code]]
||Class||Definition (if necessary)||[[[SCP]]]||
[[/code]]
[[/=]]
If a class fits into the following descriptors, it's eligible for being added here.

* **It isn't Safe, Euclid, Keter, Thaumiel, Explained, or Neutralized.** Subclasses such as "Safe-prodest" are still eligible, however.
* **It isn't a dual class of standard object classes.** A document being labeled "Euclid/Keter" is not esoteric, but "Euclid/Archon" is, and the article should be added to "Archon" below.
* **It isn't the same as another class.** For example, "Esoteric" and "Other" are not treated like separate classes. This only extends to the similarity of definitions.
* **It isn't in a joke article.** Explained SCPs, tales, GOI formats, and everything else are fair game. Exceptions can be made for subclasses in joke articles which belong to an established subclass system.

//That's it, really.// There are some special cases for esoteric classes created by foreign branches, however. Namely:

* **It isn't the result of third-party manipulation, anomalous or otherwise.** These classes tend to be single-use and the purpose of including foreign classes is to increase cohesion between branches.
* **It's a subclass.** These should be added to the Subclasses section instead of the Foreign section.
* **Its article has been translated.** If this is the case, it is no longer considered a foreign class; treat it as a local one.

------

++++* Adding Or Changing A Definition

Definitions are only valid if they're sourced from an article, from an author who has used the class, or can be reasonably drawn from "general consensus" in the absence of a definition.

Generally, self-explanatory classes like "Uncontained" should not be given definitions. If a class' meaning can be reasonably inferred from its name, then leave the definition slot blank.

------

++++* Precedents

* "Decommissioned" was added after it was given a new definition in [[[SCP-4456|SCP-4456-D]]]. It is treated as separate from the defunct standard object class of the same name.
* "N/A", "None", and "Unnecessary" are treated as separate classes due to slight variance in definitions.
* The "Location" subclass was added, despite having never been used, due to its necessity in completing the Type System.
* The multiple classes of [[[SCP-4205]]] were grouped together.
* "Scarf" and "Youklid" were added, despite being misspellings of standard classes.
* The poetry in the Object Class fields of [[[shaggydredlocks-proposal | S. D. Locke's Proposal]]] are not listed, because of their length and the proposal having already been linked under Apollyon.
* [[[SCP-5708]]] was listed under the -prodest subclass despite not using it as a subclass, per author request.

++ Subclasses

Some archivists have determined that the anomalies assigned to them do not entirely conform to standard containment classes. As such, several subclass systems have been created but rarely implemented.

[[div class="list"]]
[[collapsible show="► Subclasses ◄" hide="▼ Subclasses ▼"]]
+++* Suffix System

The following subclasses are attached to standard classes (//e.g.// Safe-alterius) to denote attributes of the anomaly. Several of these classes lack established definitions; where this is the case, definitions have been inferred.

||~ Class ||~ Definition ||~ Appearances ||
||alterius||Item is alien to Earth.||[[[SCP-824]]], [[[SCP-1041]]], [[[SCP-1141]]]||
||doctrina||Item is undergoing testing or investigation.||[[[SCP-1306]]], [[[SCP-5080]]]||
||exsequi||Item is capable of independent action.||[[[SCP-928]]], [[[SCP-1268]]], [[[SCP-1606]]], [[[SCP-1646]]], [[[SCP-1846]]], [[[SCP-1868]]], [[[SCP-2020]]], [[[SCP-4766]]], [[[SCP-5211]]]||
||flecto|| Item displays one or more biological mutations. ||[[[SCP-625]]]||

||provisi||Item is provisionally assigned a class until deemed otherwise.||[[[SCP-2721]]]||
||reliquia||Item is an artifact or relic.||[[[SCP-1962]]]||

+++* Type System

The following subclasses are used in conjunction with standard classes (//e.g.// Safe // Location) to denote the applicable method of containment.

||~ Class ||~ Definition ||~ Appearances ||
||Location||Item requires containment to be built around it.|| [PENDING ASSIGNMENT] ||
||Object||Item does not need containment built around its position and does not have containment procedures which are reactionary.||[[[SCP-2156]]]||
||Phenomenon||Item has containment procedures which are reactionary in nature.||[[[SCP-1422]]], [[[SCP-5107]]]||

+++* Object/Containment System

The following subclasses are Object Classes, with traditional classes designated Containment Classes (//e.g.// **Object Class:** Artifact; **Containment Class:** Safe) They denote characteristics of the contained item and may be used in conjunction with one another (//e.g.// Artifact/Audiovisual).

||~ Class ||~ Definition ||~ Appearances ||

++ Foreign Esoteric Classes

The Foundation is an international organization that employs researchers and archivists from almost every nation. The following are object classes created by non-English affiliates of the Foundation which are considered suitable for proper documentation.[[footnote]] Some translation errors may persist; informed archivists are welcome to update a foreign class' definition if they have the consent of the author or are otherwise certain of a better definition. [[/footnote]]
