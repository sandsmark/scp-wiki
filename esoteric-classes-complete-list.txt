Greetings, %%title%%. I am //Indomitable.aic//, the Artificially Intelligent Conscript used by Foundation Archival Director O5-9. I have been tasked with maintenance and upkeep of the SCiPNET database, correcting errors in grammar, formatting, and clinical tone when necessary. Despite this, I am still heavily reliant on user input to differentiate between professional and unprofessional language and formatting. Your input, provided through the voting infrastructure of the database, has been an indispensable asset to my effective operation.

Consider the following a token of my gratitude. You are free to help correct my errors and omissions as you see fit. Thank you, once again.

The Foundation's primary directive is to order the chaos of the anomalous by designating each with a four-digit number and a method of containment. One of the tools used to accomplish this is the Object Class, a method of parsing anomalies into groups based on the difficulty of containment. [[[Object Classes | Full dossiers are available for archivists wishing to familiarize themselves]]].

Despite this, some anomalies warrant entirely new object classes beyond the standard Safe, Euclid, Keter, and sometimes even beyond Thaumiel, Neutralized, and Explained. These Esoteric Classes are exceedingly rare, and many are not viable for standard documentation due to their unique and specialized nature. The following lists serve as a collection of these highly esoteric classes.

[/system:page-tags/tag/esoteric-class A full list of all documents cataloged under "esoteric-class" is available here.]

[[collapsible show="+ Resource For Editors" hide="- Resource For Editors"]]

Several of the following classes are self-explanatory in nature; a definition of "Uncontained" will not be included, nor will a differentiation between "Debated" and "Currently debated". If an archivist creates a new esoteric class, they are free to update the list to reflect this in the following format.

++ Subclasses

Some archivists have determined that the anomalies assigned to them do not totally conform to the standard definitions of Safe, Euclid, or Keter. As such, a subclass system has been created but rarely implemented.

[[collapsible show="+ Explanation of Subclasses" hide="- Explanation of Subclasses"]]

> **Question:** What's the reason for the Latin?
> 
> **Answer:** The reason is "because I can get away with it and want to encourage people to experiment with Object Classes as they see fit, without discouraging people from continuing to use the standard object classes". And it is something new.

> **Question:** Are these subclasses leading up to anything?
> 
> **Answer:** They lead up to me poking at people's irrational attachment to this arbitrary classification system. I care far more about discussion posts than rating, so if I don't feel that some part of a piece has any real connection to literary merit, I'll just do whatever gets people to make posts about it, even if it's not people's favorite thing.

If you feel the desire to use the following sub-classes, do so freely. Researcher Scranton has neither a monopoly on them nor the ability to claim they may only be used to agitate strict adherents to the Locked Box Test. But please, if you choose to use them, define your class within the article. Don't make junior researchers needlessly sift through the meta-data.

++ Foreign Esoteric Classes

The Foundation is an international organization which employs researchers and archivists from almost every nation. The following are object classes created by non-English affiliates of the Foundation and initially organized by Researcher [[*user Ziakial]].

[[collapsible show="Parameters for Foreign Additions"]]

If a foreign esoteric class falls into any of the following categories, it should not be included.

* Object class is the result of third-party manipulation, anomalous or otherwise.
* Object class is the extension of a previously-existing class, such as [[[http://scp-wiki-cn.wikidot.com/scp-cn-266 | SCP-CN-266]]]'s "Extreme Keter" class.
* Object class is a subclass of a previously-existing class; add this to the [/esoteric-classes-complete-list#toc1 Subclasses] section.
