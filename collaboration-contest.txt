+ The Contest

The enemy of my enemy is my friend, right? That's the theme of the 2019 Collaboration Contest! In this contest, you will team up with a partner to produce two articles about a team-up between two factions in the Foundation Universe. You must have two of the following document types:

* SCPs
* Tales
* GoI Formats

Winners will be determined by vote count. There will be a First, Second, and Third Place team.

You can not combine documents into one, but you //should// dovetail entries (an SCP, the GoI version of it, the recovery document for it, or a tale that explores the before, during, and/or after of the scenario — as an example) as thoroughly as you wish. Remember, collaboration is key, both between you and your partner and your two groups as well!

+ Rules

# You must partner up with one other user, and add yourself to the page before the posting period begins. You may only be in one pair. Use the [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-12065263/collaboration-contest#post-4277955 |Looking for Team Thread]]] to find people to work with!
# You and your partner must create two articles using two different page types (GOI Format, SCP, Tale, etc). You cannot use the same page type for both. You can write additional articles, but only the two highest rated pages will be counted for ranking purposes. 
# Your articles must feature collaboration between two GOIs. Collaboration is the name of the game in this contest, so make sure it's present in your works. 
 * Only GOIs that have appeared in at least one article on the English wiki or are on the [[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/goi-index |International GOI Index]]] can be used. 
 * POIs can be used, but ask CO members for permission first.
 * The Foundation does //NOT// count as a GOI for this purpose.
 * More than two GOIs may be used, but both articles must focus on the same two (i.e. both articles must feature the Chicago Spirit and Prometheus Labs, but one can also feature Wilson's Wildlife Solutions and the other feature Gamers Against Weed).
 * The [[[http://scp-wiki.net/the-big-goi-essay |Big GoI Essay]]] will be an invaluable resource for this contest!
# Both entries must have some narrative connection between them. 
# Both entries must be collaboratively written by you and your partner. You must both be able to receive co-author credit on both entries.
# You may **not** use drafts that existed before the contest. All entries must have been created after the contest page went up[[footnote]] Drafts that were not completed before the contest began may be admitted on a case-by-case basis. The general principle is less than 50% done; if you're not sure, feel free to ask.[[/footnote]]. 
# You may not delete or edit an article once posted, regardless of performance. All entries that dip to the deletion mark will be subject to normal deletion practices. If an article is deleted, //you can not resubmit it or submit a new one//. This should encourage everyone to work hard with their partners to have a superior product. What's posted is posted. 
 * Small corrections -- SPaG edits, image //localizing//, etc -- are fine. 
 * Significant edits -- rewriting a paragraph of text, adding new images, etc -- are not. 
 * In a nutshell, if you wouldn't do it to someone else's article before asking, don't do it.
# Any contestant who takes unusual and/or negative actions to increase their vote total, or decrease that of their competitors, will be disqualified for the involved contest and potentially banned from further contests (and possibly further disciplinary action).
 * Examples of shenanigans include, but are in no way limited to:
  * Downvoting all of your competitors' work within minutes of them being posted
  * Spamming people with PMs about your work
  * Spurring Malicious Upvoting/Downvoting, whether on your work or anyone else's
 * If you're not sure if something counts as shenanigans, then it probably does, but feel free to ask a Community Outreach Member.
# //Ronin Rule//: If your partner drops out during the posting period, you may team up with any other participant whose partner also dropped out during the posting period. You may only team up again with people who were already in a team by the deadline.
 * Please inform the contest organizers by PM and make a post in this page's discussion thread if you form a team using the Ronin Rule.

+ Important Dates

**All times are in EST**!

* //June 10//: Brainstorming period begins! Find a partner and start writing! Teams may be formed and dissolved freely during this period.
* //June 24, 12:01 AM//: Posting period begins! No more teams may be formed during this period unless the Ronin Rule applies.
* //July 1, 12:01 AM//: Posting period ends and voting period begins!
* //July 15, 12:01 AM//: Voting period ends!
* //July 16//: Winners are announced!

After posting your entries, tag them "collab-con2019" and link them to your team's hub at the bottom of this page. Winners will be decided by the total point count across the team's two highest-rated entries. The winners will have their work featured on the front page.

+ Team Hubs

Put them in order of creation about this form. Don't be a jackass and try to "alphabetize" them so yours is further up.

Standard format is:
