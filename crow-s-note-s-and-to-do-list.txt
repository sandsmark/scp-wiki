title:Crow's Notes and "To Do List"
++ Things to do:

+++ Write up:
* "Bloody Valentines". (flowers with needles)
* "Attention Whore" (A creature that feeds off of being the centre of attention, growing larger as it gets more.)
* "The Symbol" (a marking that is remarkable normal looking, but has whatever way it's drawn warps the very fabric of space and time, and the properties of the things it's on.)
* "Ironskin" [[[SCP-275]]] (Some //really// pissed off chick who's almost completely indestructible.)
* "The Flesh Tree" (This one's gonna be fun to write!)
* "Grow Your Own Castle"
* A short story involving [[[SCP-718]]].
* That Mole Rat/Pandora's Box/[[[SCP-110]]] collab I'm doing with [[[dr-gears-s-personnel-file|Dr. Gears]]].
* Finish that short story [[[Of Able]]].

+++ General things to do.
* --A new section about... things. It'll be interesting, but I gotta talk with the other Admins just how we'd go about doing it.-- (//Done//)
* Probably add to this new section...
* Do some sketches for the new picture section.
* Find out how to install a beats counter onto the site, so everyone has a common time to set their internet watches to and meet up and whatever.
* Explore all SCP, add or subtract to their rating and add a little comment as to why I've done so. (//Everyone else! You can do this too!//)
* --Acknowledge how awesome Dante is.-- I see what you did there.... //And I'm coming to get you.// 
* --Dr Steel-- Eh... No. I know it was you Bright... I'll have to get you too. So, I guess I have to set up a new list....
* //Make// an assistant.
* --Get Dr. Kondraki some coffee, ASAP-- Thanks, I wanted to make the list longer.

+++ Crow's List of People to Kill
* Dr. Dantensen - With a spoon. Why? Because I like spoons. Because they're round. Like the Moon.... (//obscure reference//)
* Dr. Bright - With a mechanical dildo capable of penetrating titanium. He'll love it.
* --Dr. Kondraki - Lowered into a steaming vat of hot coffee, the really good kind made from cat poo.-- 
**Note:** //You've got a whole vat, and you can't be bothered to get me a single cup? Man's best friend my ass.// -Dr. Kondraki
**Note:** //Fine, fine, I not going to kill you. But say please next time. I'm not a damn servant.// -Prof. Crow.

To Dr. Kain
As you know, the holiday season is fast arriving. As such, it is the time for joy, happyiness, good will towards all men, that sort of thing. And the reason I'm writing this: gifts. I've noticed from the papers I've gotten recently that you have a lot of paperwork you have to go through after that accident. So, I took the liberty to break into your office while you were busy with the Olympia Project and went through and dealt with 55% of your paperwork. Don't worry about it though, you don't need to feel pressured to get me a gift also. Though I could deal with a good look as 244 sometime.

Your fellow researcher,
Dr. Iceberg
PS- When you go over your personnal finances, you may notice a slight discrepancy in the form of 550 missing dollars. Don't worry about it. Merry Christmas!
