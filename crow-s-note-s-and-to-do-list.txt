title:Crow's Notes and "To Do List"
++ Things to do:

+++ Write up:
* "Bloody Valentines". (flowers with needles)
* "Attention Whore" (A creature that feeds off of being the centre of attention, growing larger as it gets more.)
* "The Symbol" (a marking that is remarkable normal looking, but has whatever way it's drawn warps the very fabric of space and time, and the properties of the things it's on.)
* "Ironskin" [[[SCP-275]]] (Some //really// pissed off chick who's almost completely indestructible.)
* "The Flesh Tree" (This one's gonna be fun to write!)
* A short story involving [[[SCP-718]]].
* That Mole Rat/Pandora's Box/[[[SCP-110]]] collab I'm doing with [[[dr-gears-s-personnel-file|Dr. Gears]]].
* Finish that short story [[[Of Able]]].

+++ General things to do.
* A new section about... things. It'll be interesting, but I gotta talk with the other Admins just how we'd go about doing it.
* Probably add to this new section...
* Do some sketches for the new picture section.
* Find out how to install a beats counter onto the site, so everyone has a common time to set their internet watches to and meet up and whatever.
* Explore all SCP, add or subtract to their rating and add a little comment as to why I've done so. (//Everyone else! You can do this too!//)
* --Acknowledge how awesome Dante is.-- I see what you did there.... //And I'm coming to get you.// 
* --Dr Steel-- Eh... No. I know it was you Bright... I'll have to get you too. So, I guess I have to set up a new list....
* //Make// an assistant.
* Get Dr. Kondraki some coffee, ASAP.

+++ Crow's List of People to Kill
* Dr. Dantensen
* Dr. Bright

[[[21st - 30th November 2008]]]

**02/11/2008**
I got nearly no sleep yesterday. I was so consumed with the [[[scp 157 |extractor]]] that all my previous appointments I either forgot, or simply blew off. Unprofessional and immature, I know, but I couldn't tear myself away from it. Now that I've exhausted myself and managed to break away, I now see what else I have to do. 

[[[scp-040 |Emma]]] was a little upset that I had "flaked" on our little lunch, but I've promised her that I'll drop by either today or tomorrow to talk to her, and that I'd bring her even more little snacks. I realise this is spoiling her a little, but the girl has been through figurative firestorms, not to mention what she was like when we found her. She deserves a little spoiling every now and then. Of course, ever since [[[dr clef s personnel file |Clef]]] went on his little [[[incident 239 b (clef kondraki) |rampage]]] I've been a little nervous about her safety. Granted, she's a maelstrom of energy, capable of warping life to degrees we cannot even fathom, but beneath that, is a small, lonely little girl, who really just wanted some friends. It's just I feel kind of bad for her. I know that's not very unbiased, but I have a soft spot for children. Besides, I think I made very clear to Clef exactly what I thought of his little "outburst".

I've recieved a clear estimation of when those new tools will be ready for the excavation. They've told me Friday, but that's if they push it to the limit. I've agreed with that, and added a bonus to their fee for being gracious about my demands. Still... I hate to leave this project alone for that long. But, at the very least, no accidents can happen there till then, so I guess some good can come of it.

I had put the dispersal of D-Class personnel here on hold for the past two days, until I choose the ones I want, making the rest of the site co-ordinators rather snippy with me. I had forgotten completely about it, due to aforementioned reasons, but I'll try and get down to it later today or tomorrow, before I speak with Emma.

I've applied for offical project status regarding my working for an assistant, it being christened the "[[[Olympia Project]]]". I was actually hoping for it to be named after the Chimera, but I guess being named after Olimpia from E.T. Hoffman's "[*http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Der_Sandmann Der Sandmann]". High Command aren't exactly posistive about what I'm doing in this project but as long as I'm getting all this research done, they don't seem to care, unless I blow this place up.
