title:Crow's Notes and "To Do List"
++ Things to do:

+++ Write up:
* "Bloody Valentines". (flowers with needles)
* "Attention Whore" (A creature that feeds off of being the centre of attention, growing larger as it gets more.)
* "The Symbol" (a marking that is remarkable normal looking, but has whatever way it's drawn warps the very fabric of space and time, and the properties of the things it's on.)
* "Ironskin" [[[SCP-275]]] (Some //really// pissed off chick who's almost completely indestructible.) //Dammit, I still have to properly finish off this one.//
* "The Flesh Tree" (This one's gonna be fun to write!)
* --"Grow Your Own Castle"-- (Done)
* --"Ol' Red"-- (Done)
* A rolling stone.
* A short story involving [[[SCP-718]]].
* That Mole Rat/Pandora's Box/[[[SCP-110]]] collab I'm doing with [[[dr-gears-s-personnel-file|Dr. Gears]]].
* Finish that short story [[[Of Able]]].
* Do up a zombie style short story regarding the excavation incident.

+++ General things to do.
* --A new section about... things. It'll be interesting, but I gotta talk with the other Admins just how we'd go about doing it.-- (//Done//)
* Probably add to this new section...
* Do some sketches for the new picture section.
* --Find out how to install a beats counter onto the site, so everyone has a common time to set their internet watches to and meet up and whatever.-- (//Can't find an embeddable program that'll do it//)
* Explore all SCP, add or subtract to their rating and add a little comment as to why I've done so. (//Everyone else! You can do this too!//)
* --Acknowledge how awesome Dante is.-- I see what you did there.... //And I'm coming to get you.// 
* --Dr Steel-- Eh... No. I know it was you Bright... I'll have to get you too. So, I guess I have to set up a new list....
* --//Make// an assistant.-- (//Done. **Finally**)
* --Get Dr. Kondraki some coffee, ASAP-- Thanks, I wanted to make the list longer.

+++ Crow's List of People to Kill
* Dr. Dantensen - With a spoon. Why? Because I like spoons. Because they're round. Like the Moon.... (//obscure reference//)
* --Dr. Bright - With a mechanical dildo capable of penetrating titanium. He'll love it.--
* --Dr. Kondraki - Lowered into a steaming vat of hot coffee, the really good kind made from cat poo.-- 
**Note:** //You've got a whole vat, and you can't be bothered to get me a single cup? Man's best friend my ass.// -Dr. Kondraki
**Note:** //Fine, fine, I not going to kill you. But say please next time. I'm not a damn servant.// -Prof. Crow
**Note:** //Thanks a lot Crow! Got me out of that damn monkey body. You're a real pal.// -Dr. Bright
**Note:** //I'm not sure if that's sarcasm or not... Best just to ignore it.// -Prof. Crow

+++ **Log**

[[[21st - 30th November 2008]]]
[[[1st - 12th December 2008]]]
[[[13th - 23rd December 2008]]]

**24/12/2008**
Well, Christmas Eve is here, and I believe [[[scp-2412|Mr. Kringle]]] may have infected the staff with cheer, because the amount of getting getting done is non existent. Of course, I'm one to talk... I'm the one who aallowed them to do it, as well as stopping my own personal experiments. (//Mainly because I feel bad if I indirectly allow someone to get killed horrifically at Christmas.//) 

I've even stopped the experiment on [[[scp-040|Emily]]] for the past few days, and well, requisitioned some time off for her. Granted, owing to the state of her condition, she still is unready for a heavily urbanized area, but she was allowed to venture outside for a good deal, near the [[[scp-148|grove]]], although of course, she wasn't actually allowed inside it.

[[[experiment log 158 ag|Zero]]]'s [[[olympia integration experiment alpha|body]]] has stabilized enough for the implantation for us to continue, and finally merge the mental body and the physical one. We're going to do it tomorrow. So, my assistant is technically going to be "born" on Christmas day. Not a bad present if I do say so myself.

**25/12/2008**
SHE'S ALIVE!

**28/12/2008**
I've spent most of the past few days with Zero. Since she has woken up, it has taken her three days to learn to do pretty much everything that takes a normal human child twenty years. I'm fairly sure she hasn't slept in that time, but I'm not sure she needs to.

Christmas was good, and thankfully uneventful. Most of the residents and SCP alike enjoyed what little trinkets or services they received. Emily was especially happy at what she received. I gave her a little television, one with access to most childrens channels, to be available for an hour or two a day. I myself received a very nice holiday to Spain, thanks to a very special certain someone. They know who they are. Although the staff seem curiously joyous at that.

Ah, yes, Zero's name. I was pleasantly surprised when she told me of it. So many connotations, so many meanings. She told me as soon as she could form the words.

Sophia.

**02/01/2009**
Well, the role of being a father has fallen to me these past few days, as well as site administrator. I've been easing Sophia into the real world, trying to make the transition as painless as possible, and, as expected, Sophia is taking to everything like a fish does to water. She's learned decades of research, centuries of history, over seven different languages, and still her appetite for knowledge has not been sated. Soon she might overshadow even me.

The only thing that has me worried, is that high command have decreed that since she seems to be working so well that they've ordered full scale production, albeit with some minor alterations to the original product. I realize that this is for the good for the Foundation, and the world at large, but I just can't help but feel that its cheapening the original life I brought into this world. Sentimentality... Bah, one day feelings like this will be the death of me.

Most of the on site research has been reinstated, and finally the site is getting back to work. Experimentation with Emily, and trying to improve her mental condition is continuing again, despite the fact she just wants to watch "[*http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_Gloom Ruby Gloom]" all the time. And I told her handlers to ration the time she has with the television... I guess we're going to have to slowly wean her off of it a little.

The excavation area has been completely ignored over the holidays, and although I, as always, lament the lack of research being performed, I can at least appreciate the fact that no one has died, mutated, or even gone insane in that area. But alas, we must continue with testing. Excavation is still disallowed, at least until we figure out what exactly is this "thing" in the center. We'll be doing testing with the [[[experiment log 914 theta#toc3|bone orb]]]. I don't want to subject Sophia to whatever danger that may be there, as she might be more susceptible to it due to her multidimensional nature.

On the bright side, I shall be leaving for my brief little holiday on Wednesday, although, it is rather unfortunate that I must leave behind the [[[scp-244|walker]]], and be accompanied by several armed guards, not to mention the fact I can't go sight seeing or into public places or even outside without disguise "procedures", i.e. being naked. Granted, as a dog, I have no real need for clothes, but dammit, I don't exactly enjoy being naked either. It's rather demeaning....

Dammit, I hate being a dog sometimes. I am looking forward to the food though, and my company will be superb. If, that is, they can get some sort of feeling of privacy despite the dozen or so armed guards around us. Damn.
