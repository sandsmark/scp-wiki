title:Crow's Notes and "To Do List"
++ Things to do:

+++ Write up:
* "Bloody Valentines". (flowers with needles)
* "Attention Whore" (A creature that feeds off of being the centre of attention, growing larger as it gets more.)
* "The Symbol" (a marking that is remarkable normal looking, but has whatever way it's drawn warps the very fabric of space and time, and the properties of the things it's on.)
* A short story involving [[[SCP-718]]].
* That Mole Rat/Pandora's Box/[[[SCP-110]]] collab I'm doing with [[[dr-gears-s-personnel-file|Dr. Gears]]].

+++ General things to do.
* A new section about... things. It'll be interesting, but I gotta talk with the other Admins just how we'd go about doing it.
* Probably add to this new section...
* Do some sketches for the new picture section.
* Find out how to install a beats counter onto the site, so everyone has a common time to set their internet watches to and meet up and whatever.
* Explore all SCP, add or subtract to their rating and add a little comment as to why I've done so. (//Everyone else! You can do this too!//)
* --Acknowledge how awesome Dante is.-- // I see what you did there.... And I'm coming to get you.

Didn't get any work done today. Too many things to file and fold, and put away. Things are constantly getting out of hand here, and it's a little daunting to do some of these things when you're only two foot tall and lack and type of grasping appendage besides your mouth.

Luckily there were no incidents today either. That almost brings us to the previous record, six months. Of course, now that I've said this, I've probably jinxed it.

There were some nice things however. The research team involved with [[[SCP-261]]] were doing some work today and there were some delectable little snacks involved. They didn't seem to want any though, which was their loss really. I'll have to see if they can produce any more. I quite liked those little things.

[[[SCP-244]]] needs just a little more tweaking. I can feel it though, niggling in the back of my head like something rubbing against the back of my brain. It's really quite disconcerting. I'll have to adjust the connection subtly.

Excavation will continue tomorrow, finally becoming a priority again after having to wade through all that bloody red tape. I'll have to over see some of it, just to make sure that there won't be a recurrence of what happened last time. That would just be irritating.

I did jinx it... Dammit, a record sixteen fatalities in one day. I told them not to touch that damn thing until it had been observed for a bit longer, but nooooo, no-one listens to the dog. Now we're left scraping up the damn mess from the walls and floor and ceilings of at least four rooms and almost a mile of hallways. Well... When I say we, I mean poor bastards with about a month to live. I wouldn't subject even the lowest Level 1 staff to **that** kind of mess.

Because of that incompetence, my workload has tripled. TRIPLED! Ugh, and I barely get enough sleep as it is. At this rate, I'll be napping while SCP-244 is running between hallways, while I get the machine to start filing papers on automatic, and that'll make me //dream// of doing paperwork.

Its almost time for the annual harvest of [[[SCP-143]]]. I'm somewhat responsible for the current shortage, and I guess I should help them out with the sweeping and such, but that'll get rid of whatever I have planned for the weekend. Dammit.
