title:Crow's Notes and "To Do List"
++ Things to do:

+++ Write up:
* "Bloody Valentines". (flowers with needles)
* "Attention Whore" (A creature that feeds off of being the centre of attention, growing larger as it gets more.)
* "The Symbol" (a marking that is remarkable normal looking, but has whatever way it's drawn warps the very fabric of space and time, and the properties of the things it's on.)
* "Ironskin" [[[SCP-275]]] (Some //really// pissed off chick who's almost completely indestructible.) //Dammit, I still have to properly finish off this one.//
* "The Flesh Tree" (This one's gonna be fun to write!)
* --"Grow Your Own Castle"-- (Done)
* --"Ol' Red"-- (Done)
* A rolling stone.
* A short story involving [[[SCP-718]]].
* That Mole Rat/Pandora's Box/[[[SCP-110]]] collab I'm doing with [[[dr-gears-s-personnel-file|Dr. Gears]]].
* Finish that short story [[[Of Able]]].
* Do up a zombie style short story regarding the excavation incident.

+++ General things to do.
* --A new section about... things. It'll be interesting, but I gotta talk with the other Admins just how we'd go about doing it.-- (//Done//)
* Probably add to this new section...
* Do some sketches for the new picture section.
* Find out how to install a beats counter onto the site, so everyone has a common time to set their internet watches to and meet up and whatever.
* Explore all SCP, add or subtract to their rating and add a little comment as to why I've done so. (//Everyone else! You can do this too!//)
* --Acknowledge how awesome Dante is.-- I see what you did there.... //And I'm coming to get you.// 
* --Dr Steel-- Eh... No. I know it was you Bright... I'll have to get you too. So, I guess I have to set up a new list....
* //Make// an assistant.
* --Get Dr. Kondraki some coffee, ASAP-- Thanks, I wanted to make the list longer.

+++ Crow's List of People to Kill
* Dr. Dantensen - With a spoon. Why? Because I like spoons. Because they're round. Like the Moon.... (//obscure reference//)
* --Dr. Bright - With a mechanical dildo capable of penetrating titanium. He'll love it.--
* --Dr. Kondraki - Lowered into a steaming vat of hot coffee, the really good kind made from cat poo.-- 
**Note:** //You've got a whole vat, and you can't be bothered to get me a single cup? Man's best friend my ass.// -Dr. Kondraki
**Note:** //Fine, fine, I not going to kill you. But say please next time. I'm not a damn servant.// -Prof. Crow
**Note:** //Thanks a lot Crow! Got me out of that damn monkey body. You're a real pal.// -Dr. Bright
**Note:** //I'm not sure if that's sarcasm or not... Best just to ignore it.// -Prof. Crow

**24/12/2008**
Well, Christmas Eve is here, and I believe [[[scp-2412|Mr. Kringle]]] may have infected the staff with cheer, because the amount of getting getting done is non existent. Of course, I'm one to talk... I'm the one who aallowed them to do it, as well as stopping my own personal experiments. (//Mainly because I feel bad if I indirectly allow someone to get killed horrifically at Christmas.//) 

I've even stopped the experiment on [[[scp-040|Emily]]] for the past few days, and well, requisitioned some time off for her. Granted, owing to the state of her condition, she still is unready for a heavily urbanized area, but she was allowed to venture outside for a good deal, near the [[[scp-148|grove]]], although of course, she wasn't actually allowed inside it.

[[[experiment log 158 ag|Zero]]]'s [[[olympia integration experiment alpha|body]]] has stabilized enough for the implantation for us to continue, and finally merge the mental body and the physical one. We're going to do it tomorrow. So, my assistant is technically going to be "born" on Christmas day. Not a bad present if I do say so myself.
