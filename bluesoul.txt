**History:** Dr. T████ was originally introduced to the Foundation as contracted IT support to recable Site-24's fiber-optic lines and diagnose persistent failures in a server rack in Research Wing B. Near the end of the work, [[[SCP-1048]]] was spotted free of containment. When Dr. T████ punched SCP-1048 through a non-structural wall and into the Containment Wing, he was approached by Dr. Kensington for employment as full-time IT Support and possible work outside of network administration. Upon consultation with O5, it was proposed that T████ be planted in the SPC. To date, his work in that sphere has been somewhat successful.
