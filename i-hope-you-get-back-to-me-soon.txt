**Event Data:** {{Hey dad, I've been fiddling around with your old watch you had in the attic. I think I can make it work again. A lot of electrical stuff has been starting to work like normal but it's really slow and wonky. Maybe that's why these messages aren't being sent to you. I'll post what David thinks. See ya.}}

------

------

{{Okay, bye.}}

------

**Date:** ██/█/████

**Event Data:** {{There was this comet that flew past Earth and David said the light reflections was the main thing that turned Europa purple. It was soooo beautiful and also cute because Tommy took me up on top of a hill to watch it with me. I blushed so hard when he hugged me and kissed my cheek. I was like crying OMG.}}

{{BTW this "event data" thingy is kinda annoying... Do you know how to turn it off?}}

------

------

**Date:** █/█/████

**Event Data:** {{David was pestering me again today about how I could unlock this SCP computer. I showed him your card and the password and stuff. I hope you don't get mad daddy, he was just SO annoying and I needed to shut him up. Talk to you later. Please respond...? :)}}

------

**Date:** █/██/████

------

**Date:** ██/██/████

**Event Data:** {{Why did you leave me daddy? I miss you so much! Please come home.}}

------

WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOU ABANDON ME JUST TO FLY INTO SPACE AND FIND SOME ASTRONAUT CIRCLING AROUND SATURN'S ORBIT???!!!!! I don't give a shit if it's your wife! You still left me here... You fucking coward!}}

------

**Date:** ██/██/████

**Event Data:** {{Why do you have to be so far away?}}

------

**Date:** █/██/████

**Event Data:** {{My attempts at suicide haven't worked yet... I'll keep you posted.}}

------

**Date:** █/██/████

**Event Data:** {{Tommy found me with my wrists slit in the bathtub this morning. Maybe it's because the sun is so dark... And the moon doesn't exist... All we have is that massive blue moon hovering just above our atmosphere. Whenever I walk down the streets people are crying, or jumping off of buildings, or doing whatever...}}

{{... Or maybe I just can't see properly...}}

{{Tommy seems to be the only one that's happy in this world, the only person I can trust. Goodnight dad.}}

------

**Date:** ██/██/████

**Event Data:** {{I'm sorry for being mean to you a few weeks ago... I just need you so badly right now. Tommy says that I should be emptying out my emotions to him rather that you but... I'm scared daddy. Please come home. I miss you so much.}}
