**50+ UPVOTES! THANKS EVERYONE FOR YOUR SUPPORT!!**



hello. i am pastarasta1, and i really do like drawing because it is really fun to do. the scp foundation is a good community as has a lot of great things to draw. its also a big part of my life because --i have none-- its inspired me a lot to create things. 

anyway, this will be where i upload art and talk about it. i want to thank everyone who has told me that my art was ok. call these my "art highlights". also it will get really opinionated in some spots because i think someone out there cares? idk i care about opinions on the internet a lot and i love it when plp do this.

also this is my new youtube channel for my shitposting and art needs, dont take this channel too seriously its really bad: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNUG1Ku-pskfH1SAzgRMlkw

click the images for full quality. //seriously it makes my art look so much better.//

**WARNING: some of my art contains blood and gore and sometimes rlly heavy themes.**

**this page will be updated and yes, i do requests**

**//SCP RELATED ART://**

[[collapsible show="SCP-3000" hide="mmmmmmm fishey...."]]
[[image 3000 width="300px"]]
honestly, 3000 is one of the more overbuilt SCPs out there, and honestly I find the build up to how awesome it is by other people to sorta ruin it for me. it's not by any stretch of the word bad tho, and i really enjoyed the imagery of having ur entire life just light out of ur brain like a battery draining and then getting --vored epic style-- consumed and just... fucking melt away. that is pretty creepy.

[[collapsible show="SCP-3138" hide="my sonamy shipping fanfiction has a lot more dead bodies then usual"]]
[[image 3138 width="300px"]]
mmmm 3138 was really good and fun i had to draw it. there is something really entertaining about hiding a body in a fucking book.

[[collapsible show="Eating Crow" hide="itchy and hungry"]]
[[image eating width="300px"]]
i really enjoy the tone this story went through, and the fact it wasn't exactly based off any scp leads me to have a small headcanon about it. i should probably read the doomsday team about birds since i love birds so much. 
[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show="SCP-1026-RU" hide="best backscratcher"]]
[[image 1026-RU width="300px"]]
1026-RU has the most cliche design, yet i love it so much. its one of the older russian scps so i guess it's excusable, plus its pretty entertaining to read. i really like the part when it got **//thick...//** after hearing about an all you can eat buffet being held at the foundation. it's a rlly odd one.

[[collapsible show="SCP-471-JP" hide="he's a killer(?)"]]
[[image 471-JP width="300px"]]
SCP-471-JP is one of my favorite -JPs, and I do really like my design for it. The fact that it's basically a urban legend made me helpless in giving him a really goofy looking "scary" face.

this was a dumb crossover with SCP and an indie horror game i like that got fucking 300+ on reddit. i guess ill list down what all the characters are.
playtime is 053, baldi is 993, it's a bully is 303, the principle of the thing is 036-JP-1, arts and crafters is a sock with 1439 on it, and Gotta Sweep is 1837.

baldi's basics recently had an update so i decided to draw the two new characters introduced. 

1st Prize is 2521 and Filename2 (the character in the hidden ending) is 2786.

1st Prize is such a pain in the ass because he's just a more bothersome Gotta Sweep.

i went on the international scp discord and requested for requests and Zhange asked if i could do BumaroIon, I asked for references which is why they both look rlly similar to how zhange draws the two. 

I think I did ok but I am bad at drawing clothing and stuff which is why my people are usually just bleach white and naked looking.

This was kind of a test on realistic skin tone and how it would look on my simplistic characters. I think it looks ok but most of my art will still be bleach white because my characters are kind of a blank slate in a way. That's why the SCP has skin color but the other guy got that white stuff.

i made this for lordstonefish's 001 proposal that i absolutely loved to death! i wont describe it in respect to if they are still trying to work on it in some other way as it seemed really ARG the way they were talking about it.

the image is animated so click on it to see it movie. stonefish this was amazing i hope ur still working on it in some way.

EDIT: WELL they recently uploaded their 4000 which is basically a continuation of that so thanks so much and I am currently thinking on how I'm going to draw it cuz its a crazy one.

i really like Baldi's Basics, this is honestly my first ever comic so it might not be that good but Arts and Crafters is a really fun character in design and (the little) personality he has. 





here's a bonus comic made with the septapus bot, we were discussing the comic i made on scpd and it devolved to this

I know creepypasta gets a bad rap from quite a lot of people, but I don't think that's fair, because with every bad one there is a few diamonds in the rough, for example, my favorite ritualpasta. One-Man Hide and Seek, where you basically put a little ghost inside a doll and you play hide and seek with it.

It's not as fun as it sounds. Trust me.

Also, this is the first time I mixed reality and drawing into my work, and I loved doing it because it makes things look weird and cool and people I showed it to on Vapor Memory Discord liked it.
