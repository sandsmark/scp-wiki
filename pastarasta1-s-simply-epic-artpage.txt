hello. i am pastarasta1, and i really do like drawing because it is really fun to do. the scp foundation is a good community as has a lot of great things to draw. its also a big part of my life because --i have none-- its inspired me a lot to create things. 

anyway, this will be where i upload art and talk about it. i want to thank everyone who has told me that my art was ok. call these my "art highlights". also it will get really opinionated in some spots because i think someone out there cares? idk i care about opinions on the internet a lot and i love it when plp do this.

also this is my new youtube channel for my shitposting and art needs, dont take this channel too seriously its really bad: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNUG1Ku-pskfH1SAzgRMlkw

click the images for full quality. //seriously it makes my art look so much better.//

**WARNING: some of my art contains blood and gore and sometimes rlly heavy themes.**

**this page will be updated and yes, i do requests**

**//SCP RELATED ART://**

[[collapsible show="SCP-3000" hide="mmmmmmm fishey...."]]
[[image 3000 width="300px"]]
honestly, 3000 is one of the more overbuilt SCPs out there, and honestly I find the build up to how awesome it is by other people to sorta ruin it for me. it's not by any stretch of the word bad tho, and i really enjoyed the imagery of having ur entire life just light out of ur brain like a battery draining and then getting --vored epic style-- consumed and just... fucking melt away. that is pretty creepy.

[[collapsible show="SCP-3138" hide="my sonamy shipping fanfiction has a lot more dead bodies then usual"]]
[[image 3138 width="300px"]]
mmmm 3138 was really good and fun i had to draw it. there is something really entertaining about hiding a body in a fucking book.

[[collapsible show="Eating Crow" hide="itchy and hungry"]]
[[image eating width="300px"]]
i really enjoy the tone this story went through, and the fact it wasn't exactly based off any scp leads me to have a small headcanon about it. i should probably read the doomsday team about birds since i love birds so much.

[[collapsible show="SCP-1026-RU" hide="best backscratcher"]]
[[image 1026-RU width="300px"]]
1026-RU has the most cliche design, yet i love it so much. its one of the older russian scps so i guess it's excusable, plus its pretty entertaining to read. i really like the part when it got **//thick...//** after hearing about an all you can eat buffet being held at the foundation. it's a rlly odd one.

[[collapsible show="SCP-471-JP" hide="he's a killer(?)"]]
[[image 471-JP width="300px"]]
SCP-471-JP is one of my favorite -JPs, and I do really like my design for it. The fact that it's basically a urban legend made me helpless in giving him a really goofy looking "scary" face.

this was a dumb crossover with SCP and an indie horror game i like that got fucking 300+ on reddit. i guess ill list down what all the characters are.
playtime is 053, baldi is 993, it's a bully is 303, the principle of the thing is 036-JP-1, arts and crafters is a sock with 1439 on it, and Gotta Sweep is 1837.

baldi's basics recently had an update so i decided to draw the two new characters introduced. 

1st Prize is 2521 and Filename2 (the character in the hidden ending) is 2786.

1st Prize is such a pain in the ass because he's just a more bothersome Gotta Sweep.

[[collapsible show="bumaro x ion" hide="shipping is epic"]]
[[image BumaroIon width="300px"]]
i went on the international scp discord and requested for requests and Zhange asked if i could do BumaroIon, I asked for references which is why they both look rlly similar to how zhange draws the two. 

I think I did ok but I am bad at drawing clothing and stuff which is why my people are usually just bleach white and naked looking.

edit: someone on reddit told me this sucks and it turns out they draw fnaf porn (pretty badly imo) and then I was insulted in another language being told that I was a capitalistic pig and I would die in a pit of mountain dew and doritos (because you know me, always liked doritos, totally.) It was fucking hilarious. thx fnaf porn lover for being a hilarious buffoon further proving that people dont hate my art as much as they just hate my style.

I tried to capture the essence of this SCP with my drawing, I don't think I did very well but it was worth a shot, the animation is a test because the SCP is experimental so I tried being experimental and IDK if it worked, I'm trying new things and shit weee.

update: i can't get enough of 280-FR it turns out, i drew ANOTHER piece of it. i was inspired by shaggydreadlocks talking about faceless protagonists and i wanted to draw something that had the same feeling of a faceless protag, also yes, i can't get over the faces i drew for this one either, animals are the fucking best thing ever.

the image is animated so click on it to see it movie. stonefish this was amazing i hope ur still working on it in some way.

EDIT: WELL they recently uploaded their 4000 which is basically a continuation of that so thanks so much and I am currently thinking on how I'm going to draw it cuz its a crazy one.

i really like Baldi's Basics, this is honestly my first ever comic so it might not be that good but Arts and Crafters is a really fun character in design and (the little) personality he has. 





here's a bonus comic made with the septapus bot, we were discussing the comic i made on scpd and it devolved to this

[[collapsible show="One-Man Hide and Seek (ritual creepypasta)" hide="found you!"]]
[[image foundyou width="300px"]]
I know creepypasta gets a bad rap from quite a lot of people, but I don't think that's fair, because with every bad one there is a few diamonds in the rough, for example, my favorite ritualpasta. One-Man Hide and Seek, where you basically put a little ghost inside a doll and you play hide and seek with it.

It's not as fun as it sounds. Trust me.

Also, this is the first time I mixed reality and drawing into my work, and I loved doing it because it makes things look weird and cool and people I showed it to on Vapor Memory Discord liked it.
