hello. i am pastarasta1, and i really do like drawing because it is really fun to do. the scp foundation is a good community as has a lot of great things to draw. its also a big part of my life because --i have none-- its inspired me a lot to create things. 

anyway, this will be where i upload art and talk about it. i want to thank everyone who has told me that my art was ok. call these my "art highlights". also it will get really opinionated in some spots because i think someone out there cares? idk i care about opinions on the internet a lot and i love it when plp do this.

click the images for full quality. 

**WARNING: some of my art contains blood and gore and sometimes rlly heavy themes.**

**this page will be updated and yes, i do requests**

[[collapsible show="SCP-3000" hide="mmmmmmm fishey...."]]
[[image 3000 width="300px"]]
honestly, 3000 is one of the more overbuilt SCPs out there, and honestly I find the build up to how awesome it is by other people to sorta ruin it for me. it's not by any stretch of the word bad tho, and i really enjoyed the imagery of having ur entire life just light out of ur brain like a battery draining and then getting --vored epic style-- consumed and just... fucking melt away. that is pretty creepy.

[[image 3138 width="300px"]]
mmmm 3138 was really good and fun i had to draw it. there is something really entertaining about hiding a body in a fucking book.

[[collapsible show="Eating Crow" hide="itchy and hungry"]]
[[image eating width="300px"]]
i really enjoy the tone this story went through, and the fact it wasn't exactly based off any scp leads me to have a small headcanon about it. i should probably read the doomsday team about birds since i love birds so much.

[[collapsible show="SCP-1026-RU" hide="best backscratcher"]]
[[image 1026-RU width="300px"]]
1026-RU has the most cliche design, yet i love it so much. its one of the older russian scps so i guess it's excusable, plus its pretty entertaining to read. i really like the part when it got **//thick...//** after hearing about an all you can eat buffet being held at the foundation. it's a rlly odd one.

[[collapsible show="SCP-471-JP" hide="he's a killer(?)"]]
[[image 471-JP width="300px"]]
SCP-471-JP is one of my favorite -JPs, and I do really like my design for it. The fact that it's basically a urban legend made me helpless in giving him a really goofy looking "scary" face.

SCP-374-JP is probably one of the weirdest metaphors for reeling in a fish and throwing it out. I love it so much.

[[collapsible show="Bobble's Basics (new characters)" hide="no drawing dumb shit in the halls"]]
[[image baldi2 width="300px"]]
baldi's basics recently had an update so i decided to draw the two new characters introduced. 

1st Prize is 2521 and Filename2 (the character in the hidden ending) is 2786.

1st Prize is such a pain in the ass because he's just a more bothersome Gotta Sweep.

[[collapsible show="bumaro x ion" hide="shipping is epic"]]
[[image BumaroIon width="300px"]]
i went on the international scp discord and requested for requests and Zhange asked if i could do BumaroIon, I asked for references which is why they both look rlly similar to how zhange draws the two. 

I think I did ok but I am bad at drawing clothing and stuff which is why my people are usually just bleach white and naked looking.

993 is a really good character that is slightly underrated in his more tale like appearances.

[[image artcraft width="300px"]]
i really like Baldi's Basics, this is honestly my first ever comic so it might not be that good but Arts and Crafters is a really fun character in design and (the little) personality he has. 





here's a bonus comic made with the septapus bot, we were discussing the comic i made on scpd and it devolved to this
