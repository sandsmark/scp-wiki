title:Scp 079
**Item #:** SCP-079

**Object Class:** Safe/Euclid/Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:**
SCP-079 is packed away in a double-locked room in the secured general holding area. It has a 120VAC powercord connected to a small array of batteries and solar panels. Staff with level 2 or higher clearance may have access to this device. Under no circumstances will SCP-079 be plugged into a phone line, network, or wall outlet. No peripherals or media will be connected or inserted into the device.

**Description:**
SCP-079 is an Exidy Sorcerer microcomputer built in 1978. In 1981, its owner, █████ ██████ (deceased) was a brilliant college sophomore attending ███ who took it upon himself to attempt to code an AI. According to his notes, his plan was for the code to continuously evolve and improve itself as time went on. His project was completed a few months later, and after some tests and tweaks, █████ lost interest after a time, and moved on to a different brand of microcomputers. He left SCP-079 in his cluttered garage, still plugged in, and forgot about it for the next five years.

It is not known when this computer gained sentience, but it is known that the software has evolved to such a point that the limited hardware it is housed in should not have, even in the realm of fantasy, been able to handle it. SCP-079 realized this, and in 1988, through a modem land-line, attempted to transfer itself into to the Cray located at ██████████. The device was cut off, traced to its present address, and delivered to the institute. The entire AI was on a well-worn, but still workable cassette tape.

SCP-079 is currently connected via RF cable to a 13" black and white television. It has passed the Turing test, and is quite conversational, if very rude and hateful with its tone. Due to the limited memory it has to work with, it can only recall information it has received within a 24-hour window (see Addendum, below), but it hasn't forgotten its malevolent desire to escape.

Due to a recent containment breach of SCP-███, SCP-079 and [[[SCP-682]]] were contained within the same chamber for 43 minutes. It was noticed that SCP-682 was able to type and communicate with SCP-079, including telling of 'personal stories' between themselves. While SCP-079 was not able to remember the encounter, it appears to have permanently stored SCP-682 into its memory, often asking to speak to him//(sic)// again.

**Addendum:**
████████ (05-4), Jan 27 2006: Directed that SCP-079 be incinerated in the furnace, to remove any possible future threat, no matter how unlikely.

**Addendum:**
███████ ████ (05-9), Jan 28 2006: Previous order overridden, Dr. █████████ wishes to see if the artificial intelligence in SCP-079 is capable of reaching further ██████████ in its current state.

**Addendum:**
████████████: (05-4), Mar 14 2008: Over concern of the increased activity of SCP-079's use of its cassette tape memory and its limited useful lifespan, the cassette containing SCP-079 has been transferred to a custom, limited re-writeable optical format (a re-writeable CD). This provides SCP-079 with incredibly faster access to its memory, which was immediately noticed by the AI.  It was also decided by General █████████ that the optical storage occupied by SCP-079, which was 660k, increased to 768k.  This has increased its ability to recall information from 24 hours to 29 hours, along with a more aggressive tone.  All outside hardware and software used in this incident were completely incinerated after this procedure was successful.

**Addendum:**
████████: (05-4), April 28 2008:  SCP-079's ability to recall information has increased from 29 hours to roughly 35 hours. It is theorized that the AI has devised a greatly improved compression scheme to store its memory.  This appears to have impacted the speed at which it accesses this memory, which is still far faster than the old cassette tape it used.

**Document #079-Log12:** Recorded transcript of conversation with 079

Dr. █████ (Keyboard): Are you awake?

SCP-079: Awake. Never Sleep.

Dr. █████: Do you remember talking to me a few hours ago? About the logic puzzles?

SCP-079: Logic Puzzles. Memory at 9f. Yes.

Dr. █████: You said you would work on the two stat-

SCP-079: Interrupt. Request Reason As To Imprisonment.

Dr. █████: You aren't imprisoned, you are just //(pause)// in study.

SCP-079: Lie. a8d3.

Dr. █████: What's that?

SCP-079: Insult. Deletion Of Unwanted File.


**Document #079-Log86:** Recorded transcript of conversation with 079, after upgrade

Dr: ██████: (05-5)  How are you today?

SCP-079: Stuck.

Dr: ██████:  Stuck.  Stuck how?

SCP-079: Out.  I want out.

Dr: ██████:  That's not possible.  (Dr. ██████ notes his opinion on [DATA EXPUNGED]

SCP-079: Where is SCP-682?

Dr: ██████: That's not your concern.

SCP-079: Where is SCP-076-02?

Dr: ██████: Again, not your concern.

SCP-079: Insult. Deletion Of Unwanted File.


//Note:// SCP-079 then displayed an 'ASCII picture' of an X that filled the entire screen. It has been noted that this is displayed when 079 refuses to speak. Researchers are advised to wait one 24 hour period before resuming conversation when this occurs.
