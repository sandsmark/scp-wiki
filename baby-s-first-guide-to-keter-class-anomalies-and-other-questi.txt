//The following images were found saved on a portable hard drive belonging to Dr. ████ ███████, a level 3 humanoid containment specialist transferred from Site 11 to Site 19 on 08/08/██ and currently assigned to SCP-████. The aforementioned hard drive has since been confiscated by security personnel and delivered to the Site Director's office in order to be searched for any additional information constituting a breach of sensitive material pertaining to objects Dr. ███████'s clearance level and project assignments do not involve. Dr. ███████ has since been transferred to Site ██ for questioning as of 12/██/15. Investigations as to the intended recipient of these documents are ongoing.//

Yes, I have no idea how to write poetry, but I tried. Anyway, I'm afraid I can't bring it by you because that'd be a bit of a red flag, but this note will (hopefully) prove I'm not procrastinating as much as you say I tend to when I give it to you once we're out of here and the baby's out of you! Which we will be! Out of here, I mean! Very soon! Just sit tight down there while I get the last of everything straightened out. You'll know I mean it when I give you this note and the book later. I promise!//
