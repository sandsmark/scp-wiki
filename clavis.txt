Her copied text was then sent through [[[SCP-758]]] to correct it, and then translated by Dr. ████████.  Immediate communication with O5-██, O5-██, and O5-██ is enacted.  Operation Thaumiel is in full effect.  Repeat: this is not a drill. Operation Thaumiel is in full action.  **DO NOT DISREGARD.** Repeat: Emergency Level X-Ray-Zulu-Zulu. Operation Thaumiel is in full action.  

//Communique recovered from Site-██ read as follows//:

> # And lo, I cried unto the Ephesians, the Smyrnanites, the Pergamonians, the Thyatirans, the Sardinians, the Philadelphians, and the Leodicians to hear my cry! And they have heard it not.  
> # For the Ephesians, ye are unto sowers of chaos and ruin, and so though shalt reape.  For thou hast strayed from the path, the true path, and shall receive none of my glory. The hand of God will smite thee and thine power shall be as sand, and the strength of your arms shall be as straw which, when smote, is broken. 
> # And ye Smyrnanites, truly thou are of the hands of the adversary, consorting with demons in thine great, hidden place, where eyes seek but do not find.  The books shall be burned up, and the doors, and the eyes of all man and beast within it.
> # Alas, ye Pergamonians, to thou the name has been given, and thou has heard it not!  Ye have turned to the cog and wheel and written a new name upon it and sought God there, but he is not there, for he is above and not of your hands.  The abomination that thou has sought to craft will be no more, and its blood and body will be as a river of copper and brass. 
> # And ye Thyatirans, my good and loyal servants who have endured and waged war on things of Satan—though thou has consorted with him, your soul is pure and clean, and I shall welcome you into the war and into the victory of heaven. 
> # Ye Sardinians, lo, thou has been unto a thorn in the side of heaven, and God has tired of this suffering and will pluck you out, for one of thee dwells in outer darkness, and the other two of thine unholy trinity will join him, and be cast forth into the void.
> # Lo, Philadelphians, thou hear not my words or my will, for you do no listen. You hands have turned upon themselves and your creations are as abominations and sin in the eyes of God. Truly, thou are of a sinful heart and mind, given only to works of evil and the mad, and shall not thine sins find thee out?
> # And ye Laodocians. Truly, thou are of the greatest of the sinners, for all thine good and loyal works, thou heapest more suffering upon those who have done no wrong in the eyes of God.  Truly, thou are as a saint who, upon saving the souls of many, dashes their faith against a stone and watches as it tumbles into the sea.  Salvation wast thine goal, and salvation thou has dealt, but salvation shall not be delivered unto you. Thou shalt be delivered unto mine hand.
> # Ye churches of the world! Hear mine voice and tremble! The gates are open! The seals are broken! The trumpets have sounded!
> # We are riding forth.
