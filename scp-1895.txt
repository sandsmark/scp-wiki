**Item #:** SCP-1895

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1895 is contained within a standard safe-class containment cell equipped with one 120V AC power outlet to facilitate testing. SCP-1895 should be unplugged and unpowered when not undergoing testing.

All instances of SCP-1895-A created should be filed with Site-52's central document repository for analysis.

**Addendum:** All testing of SCP-1895 is suspended until a method is developed to test possible changes in causality due to SCP-1895's effects.

**Description:** SCP-1895 is a modified 3 reel "Wheel of Fortune" slot machine manufactured by International Game Technology. The non-anomalous modifications to the machine are the removal of the internal coin hopper and plugging of the coin and bill acceptance mechanisms. The ticket printer, which would normally generate claim tickets, has been replaced with a larger sealed unit (SCP-1895-1) with no visible access points for replacing paper or ink used for generating tickets.

Except for SCP-1895-1, the other individual components of SCP-1895 will function normally when removed from SCP-1895 and placed within a compatible machine. SCP-1895-1 has not been dissassembled due to fears of damaging its mechanisms, and will not operate when placed within a similar machine. SCP-1895 will not display its anomalous effects unless all of its original components are in place.

1895's anomalous effects manifest when it is touched by a living human being while it is powered and in an inactive state, and who has not activated its effects before. When SCP-1895 enters an active state; 1000 credits will be credited to the machine, and it will become playable as per standard rules of non-anomalous versions of the machine. Individuals other than the one who activated SCP-1895 can use the active machine, with no-discernable differences from cases where the original activator uses it instead.

SCP-1895 ignores the internal settings for determining payout rates, though insufficient data has been collected for determining whether it follows any pattern for its winning or losing rates. However, experiments have yet to exhaust all credits on the machine despite two seperate attempts.

SCP-1895 will retain memory of the number of credits it is currently set to despite loss of power or dissassembly. It will only reset to 0 credits when the payout button is depressed. When payout is selected, a claim ticket (SCP-1895-A) is generated and the machine is reset to 0 credits. Instances of SCP-1895-A lists the name of the person that activated SCP-1895, the final number of credits, and a personalized message to the individual describing personal details of their life. Instances of SCP-1895-A display no anomalous properties.

SCP-1895 was originaly located in the McCarran International Airport located in Clark County, Nevada. It was seized by the Nevada Gaming Control Board following complaints of a rigged game. The Foundation recovered the object and distributed class D amnestics to affected users and enforcement agents who had been exposed to SCP-1895.

**Addendum-1895-EL-S:** The following are examples of SCP-1895-A instances generated during experimentation. All experiments were performed using D-Class to activate SCP-1895 unless otherwise noted.

//Name was an alias used by the press to describe D-09345 before his apprehension, who was serving 3 life sentences before inductment into the D-Class program.//

//D-54322 broke testing protocol and read the generated instance of SCP-1895-A. After this, he became distressed and assaulted security personnel on hand for testing and attempted to leave SCP-1895's containment cell. He was terminated during the struggle. Testing protocol was changed to remove D-Class from the containment room after activation of SCP-1895.//

//Research Assistant M███████ was used for this test run when the progressive jackpot was hit, causing SCP-1895 to begin emitting colored streamers from the claim check slot. After several minutes of this, the above instance of SCP-1895-A was generated and SCP-1895 was reset as though the payout button had been pressed. No record of D-█████ was located in Foundation records. She is currently being held per the zero tolerance escapee policy and all testing suspended until the full nature of SCP-1895's effects can be determined.//
