title:Scp 3467
**Item #:** SCP-3467


**Object Class:** Keter


**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3467 is to be made fun of at every opportunity. Heckling, practical jokes, and pranks are good examples. Filming the more spectacular procedures is a must.


**Description:** SCP-3467 is a six (6) foot tall, two hundred (200) pound man eating chicken. Subject is thirty five (35), slightly balding, dark brown hair and eyes, and slightly overweight. Name is Hank ██████████, and he has worked as a Level 1 cleanup crew for the past three years. Hank is never seen without a bucket of chicken, and only stops eating it when actually working, which is a rare occurrence in itself.

It is know that Hank still lives in his mom's basement, and hearsay amongst the female staff, is that he is still a virgin.


**Additional Notes:** All video footage of the more impressive "procedures" performed on Hank are available in the central reading area.


**Document 3467-01:** "//Dammit guys, this isn't funny. The system still freaks out when I enter the building, and I don't have clearance to delete this stupid file. Thanks a lot, assholes.//" Hank ██████████

**Document 3467-02:** "//Now this is a bit unfair. I mean, it's not his fault he's fat, balding, still lives with his mom and.... No, no, sorry, I can't say that with a straight face. Come on, alright, let me try it again, I'll do it proper this time, I promise.//" Dr.██████
