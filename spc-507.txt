Centre Pugilists are to report all RED NETHER sightings to CICAPOCO, at which point an authorized Marine Fighting Team will be deployed to defeat the Deviant in combat. RED NETHER threats are an EPSILON-GREEN priority, escalating to OMEGA-GREEN during a courtship ritual.

The Selachian threat known as WHITE NETHER is to be deterred at all costs.

SPC-507 exists primarily to train and equip Centre Pugilists for combat against Selachian threats from beyond our universe. The success of SPC-507 against prominent threats is as follows:

1. **__RED NETHER__**
 
> **Threat Description:** RED NETHER refers to Deviant-Type Selachian Entities that manifest in nearby universes to prepare for the Mistaken Beast's eventual arrival. During the Seventh Deviant Crusade, RED NETHER Entities were found referenced in ancient Sharkicist manuscripts as "angels" and "acolytes". RED NETHER are known for highly aggressive exhibitionist courtship rituals, which are capable of causing lightning storms, even in the vacuum of space.
> 
> Centre Pugilists have consistently went on record to describe these entities as "passive-aggressive", "demonic", and even "sassy".
> 
> **SPC Success Rate:** HIGH

2. **__WHITE NETHER__**

> **Threat Description:** WHITE NETHER refers to a massive individual Deviant-Type Selachian Entity with the capacity to travel between universes. WHITE NETHER reports typically include reference to its "ontovoric" tendencies: The entity consumes copious amounts of matter during its hunts. Whether this is for survival, sport, or carnal purposes is unknown.
> 
> Sharkic cultist holy scriptures avoid reference to WHITE NETHER where possible. When mentioned, WHITE NETHER is given the moniker "The Great Daemon". WHITE NETHER's ultimate goal has not yet been determined, as all attempts at communication have resulted in summary digestion. All Centre Pugilists encountering WHITE NETHER have gone Missing in Pugnātion.
> 
> **SPC Success Rate:** NONE

SPC-507 is an ongoing pugilistic operation co-developed by the Centre, Poseidon Laboratories, and [[[spc-1258|the Liberated Cetacean Union]]]. SPC-507 exists to locate, track down, and pummel RED NETHER Entities and deter -- or neutralize -- the WHITE NETHER threat. To this end, SPC-507 makes use of the following sub-components:

||~ Sub-Component ||~ Function ||
||~ Fractal Acclimation/Spatial Heuristic device ("FASH") || A long-range scanner capable of locating Deviant-Type Selachian threats in nearby universes; developed with the help of Poseidon Labs. ||
||~ Tyson Ontic Pugnātor || An experimental Deviant technology capable of opening portals between different branch universes by "punching" through the dimensional barrier. Developed by Dr. Mike Tyson, PhD. ||
||~ "CERULEAN EXPANSE" || Deviant-Type Cetacean Entities allied with the Centre. Each Cetacean is trained in specialized Deviant pugilism. The Liberated Cetacean Union (LCU) has granted the Centre express permission to use CERULEAN EXPANSE ||
||~ Marine Fighting Team "CHARYBDIS" ||A special forces unit outfitted with biochemical and cybernetic enhancements. The team was formed following an abundantly fatal encounter between Marine Fighting Team "SCYLLA" frogmen and WHITE NETHER. MFT CHARYBDIS is currently stationed in Kydonia, the Kingdom of Mycenae; in an underwater geodesic dome code-named "BRINE MONASTERIUM". _
 _
Their prime directive is to defeat WHITE NETHER.||
----
= [[span class="h3"]]Enhancement Summary[[/span]]
CERULEAN EXPANSE (//Supramagnum musculus atlanto//) is the largest species of Deviant-Type Cetacean Entities on Earth, capable of atmospheric and exospheric flight via twelve natural ramjet sphincters. The Centre has selected a single CERULEAN EXPANSE specimen ("Gægr Kemdulnim the Deep One") measuring 45 metres in length and over 180,000 kg in weight. 

Gægr has been outfitted with an internal cargo bay to transport a single Marine Fighting Team, their supplies, and a set of Fish Stick-Class cryogenic units, as well as subdermal implants to produce internal oxygen. Gægr has been grafted with an additional propulsion system in the form of an unobtanium power extractor, granting flight speeds of up to Mach 12 (14,800 km/h). Gægr is a veteran Cetacean pugilist -- having served in the Seventh Deviant Crusade -- and is trained in the esoteric pugilistic art of Yzylvin Xa. Gægr is fluent in English, Whalish, Sharkish, and the Cetacean song-language "Balooga".

= [[span class="h3"]]Augmentation Summary[[/span]]
MFT CHARYBDIS is a team of Centre frogmen[[footnote]]**Frogman:** A Marine Fighting Team operator, trained for combat while wearing underwater breathing equipment.[[/footnote]] enhanced with mimetic magnesium-titanium bone implants and muscular grafts extracted directly from Deviant-Type Selachian entities. After the loss of MFT SCYLLA, CHARYBDIS received further implants in the form of epinephrine emitters that yield a 200% increase in adrenal gland activity during high-stress scenarios.

CHARYBDIS uses prototype NEUROKNOCK powered armour, which consists of a high-durability vacuum-sealed tungsten carbide exoskeleton capable of enhancing pugilistic force by a factor of three. NEUROKNOCK is outfitted with a 12-hour oxygen scrubber and rebreather, heating and cooling systems, digital radio transmitter, and Selachian identification HUD. Each suit is also powered with a miniaturized unobtanium power extractor, which fuels a back-mounted rocket pack.

**Context:** The following is a list of notable SPC-507 deployments. Deployment records use the following format: Mission Number, Universe Designation, Case(s) of Interest, and Commentary.
[[/div]]

[[div class="quote-block"]]
**Mission Number:** 13

**Universe Designation:** Tri-Kaa

**Case(s) of Interest:** RED NETHER

**Commentary:** MFT CHARYBDIS' FASH device detected a RED NETHER incursion in a nearby universe, designated Tri-Kaa.

Upon arrival, CHARYBDIS entered orbit around an Earth-sized terrestrial planet, with water covering ~99% of its surface. CHARYBDIS detected the Entity 8,000 km away in geosynchronous orbit. The Entity was a Great Hammerhead Selachian (//Sphyrna mokarran//) measuring 4 metres in length.

//[The recording captures C-0 Gægr in the middle of song.]//

**C-0 Gægr:** [[size 110%]]♪[[/size]] //Not even space dust can get in our way. All together, dear friends, we'll make them pay!// [[size 110%]]♫[[/size]]

**C-3 Leah:** Oh, Gægr, that was your most beautiful song yet! //[She swoons.]//

**C-1 Quinn:** All right staff, Gægr's going to open that mouth of his in about 30 seconds. Is that right, C-0?

**C-0 Gægr:** //[He moans with glee.]//

**C-1 Quinn:** As soon as you get out there, I want C-4 to take flank.  She'll know what to do once she's in position. C-2, you take point. C-3, I need you to watch C-2's back. We good, team?

**C-3 Leah:** Aye, aye, captain!

**C-4 Haruki:** Ready to engage, sir.

**C-2 Jaedan:** //[He grumbles.]//

//[MFT CHARYBDIS exits C-0 Gægr, travels 500 metres to the Selachian's position, and dodges orbital detritus. C-4 Haruki sweeps wide to analyze the Selachian from a distance.]//

**C-4 Haruki (COM):** Ah, that Deviant bastard's taking defensive measures! I suggest Advanced Pugilistic Technique-63, 11th Edition update. You know what that means.

**C-2 Jaedan (COM):** Leah, grab my hand, I'm gonna swing you upwards. When you get there, you'll punt that Deviant straight in the snout!

**C-3 Leah (COM):** Are you sure about this, Ruki? Technique-63 is to be used explicitly in situations of panic or extreme adversity, and there's not much evidence it works unless it's a critical hit. Ruki-chan's been watching Shark Month lately, huh Jae?

//[C-2 Jaedan laughs.]//

**C-4 Haruki (COM):** It's not up for discussion, Leah, it's about to attack!

//[C-2 Jaedan takes C-3 Leah's hand and swings her toward the Selachian, using his rocket thrusters to launch her at a high speed. Immediately before contact, the Selachian heels to starboard, and she sails past. In a post-mission analysis, technicians discovered that the Selachian had been emitting low-frequency radio signals.]//

**RED NETHER Entity:** [Translation: MEAT SACKS. WHERE CAN A SHARK LIKE ME FIND A HOT SINGLE IN THIS AREA? PLEASE, IT HAS BEEN SIX MONTHS. I AM NOT KIDDING, WHAT IF I MISS MATING SEASON? I AM ACTUALLY GOING TO DIE.]

**C-2 Jaedan (COM):** This freak's an ugly bastard, isn't it! Leah, keep your distance, I'm performing Technique-21.

//[Jaedan propels toward the Selachian at 115 km/h, jabbing its neck.]//

**RED NETHER Entity:** [Translation: FUCK, BUDDY, WHAT IN THE DEPTHS IS WRONG WITH YOU? I HAVE FEELINGS TOO, YOU KNOW. THAT HAD BETTER NOT BRUISE; IT IS HARD ENOUGH TO GET A DATE LOOKING AS DUMB AS I DO.]

//[The Selachian bites down and gnaws on Jaedan's leg, but fails to breach the outer carapace. For the next three minutes, Jaedan pummels the entity, landing 124 attacks. It loses consciousness.]//

**C-1 Quinn:** Good work, team. Now, this is against regulation, but... Why don't we explore that planet down there and see what's on the menu? You reckon there are any sea cows?

**Mission Number:** 54

**Universe Designation:** Penta-Waxaklahun

**Case(s) of Interest:** Bee Obliteration Registry "K" (BORK)

**Commentary:** MFT CHARYBDIS was alerted to a RED NETHER attack in Universe Penta-Waxaklahun. 

CHARYBDIS deployed to a small terrestrial planet inhabited by humanoid entities and travelled into a city, where multiple RED NETHER Entities had launched an organized invasion force. After pummelling the Selachians into submission, a celebration was held.

//[The recording captures a confrontation between C-1 Quinn and the supposed humanoid leader.]//

**C-1 Quinn:** So you're tellin' me that your people swat //bees// for a living?

**Humanoid Leader:** I strongly urge that you police your speech around my citizens: I don't wish to cause an incident. And it's not //merely// that the Registry prostrates itself to "swat" bees. My, phrasing on a level //this// unsophisticated is problematic, but it pales in comparison to the false thoughts about bee-kind you've been indoctrinated to oviposit.

**C-1 Quinn:** Listen, if you're gonna talk trash, I'd rather it happen inside the sparring ring. And about this bee situation -- I've smelt your air! Your city hasn't had a flower bloom in decades!

**Humanoid Leader:** Bees pose a serious existential threat -- one that will halt all other life in wide swaths with just a passing glance. Bees are a repulsive abomination, most repellent, and we shall obliterate them //all//, no matter the cost. The Apiarchy takes no prisoners -- not even you or me, soldier. The Heavens command our work. And we are doing //excellent// work indeed.

//[Nearby, C-4 Haruki converses with multiple humanoid entities. The humanoids nod and dance to chest-thrumming techno music. Haruki sips a dark brown beverage from a styrofoam cup.]//

**C-4 Haruki:** Holy shit! You //have// to tell me what's in this thing. It kicks butt!

**Unknown Humanoid:** Ah, you like? This elixir was extracted from a pod of the finest powdered seed we have!

**C-4 Haruki:** //[She blinks.]// Wait, this is just coffee, isn't it? Huh, all right. //[She takes another sip.]// You wouldn't happen to have any honey, would you? I have a bit of a sweet tooth.

**Second Unknown Humanoid:** //[The entity points at C-4 Haruki and screams.]// She's in bed with the pest! The Striped Yellow Fiend! Arrest this enchantress at once! Stop them!

**C-1 Quinn:** C-4, dammit, what did you do? //[To the rest of CHARYBDIS over comms.]// Code red! Fall back!

**Case(s) of Interest:** WHITE NETHER

**Commentary:** On August 2, 2018 at 7:51 AM, the team's FASH device detected a WHITE NETHER incursion in Universe Proto-Mih: The HQ of "The SCP Foundation".

----
**«0:00:00»** MFT CHARYBDIS emerges 400 km above a planet with striking similarities to Earth. WHITE NETHER resembles a large Great White Selachian (//Carcharodon carcharias//) and consumes a passing satellite.

**«0:29:47»** Having finished its meal, WHITE NETHER descends into the atmosphere. C-0 Gægr activates his unobtanium engine and follows from a distance.

**«01:51:55»** WHITE NETHER flies above what appears to be this Earth's version of Olde New York.

**«01:57:08»** WHITE NETHER takes interest in the Statue of Liberty. The statue presents various physical abnormalities; notably, it displays a beak, feathered wings, and talons. Video magnification reveals the following note scrawled into a placard: "STATUE OF LIBIRDY". WHITE NETHER feasts on the monument.

**C-1 Quinn:** //[He yells.]// You Deviant maniac, you're destroying the Statue of Libirdy! Oh, damn you to the depths!

//[Gægr bellows like an operatic singer.]//

**C-0 Gægr:** [[size 110%]]♪[[/size]] //Mmm, this beast is mine!// [[size 110%]]♫[[/size]]

**C-1 Quinn:** Damn //right// it is. Everybody out!

**«01:59:40»** C-1, -2, -3, and -4 emerge from Gægr's open mouth and hover nearby.

**«02:00:23»** Gægr spirals into WHITE NETHER at a high velocity. WHITE NETHER heels to port and knocks debris from the statue, which rains down on humanoid entities below. The entities squawk and flee.

**«02:01:16»** Gægr reels back and rams WHITE NETHER head-on. The Selachian retaliates, spinning to face him. It swings its tail like a battering ram, slamming Gægr into the ocean.

**«02:01:58»** WHITE NETHER takes a dive. Gægr bites the Selachian's tail. In the ensuing panic, WHITE NETHER springs up from the water and thrashes, but Gægr holds on tight.

**«02:05:18»** WHITE NETHER pulls Gægr into the city at 200 km/h. The Selachian skims atop skyscraper; Gægr's bulk destroys buildings and monuments, but he fails to let go. WHITE NETHER travels toward a church in the city's residential core.

**«02:07:09»** Gægr opens his jaw, releasing WHITE NETHER, and both smash through a church wall at 250 km/h. A church bell breaks free and lands on WHITE NETHER, immobilizing it.

**«02:09:36»** In a fit of rage, Gægr pinwheels his pectoral fins into WHITE NETHER and lands fifteen rapid blows. WHITE NETHER bites down on Gægr's left pectoral fin, bisecting and consuming it. In a panic, Gægr pushes WHITE NETHER through the church, destroying the opposite wall. The two fall into the street.

**«02:10:31»** Gægr chews on WHITE NETHER's tail, plucking it from the caudal keel beyond.  WHITE NETHER turns bright red.

**C-2 Jaedan:** Oh, fuck! That's a rage state.

**C-4 Haruki:** That's not a thing.

**C-2 Jaedan:** It absolutely is, I'm //110%// positive.

**C-4 Haruki:** //[She smacks her helmet's faceplate.]// You can't– Math doesn't work that way, dumbass!

**C-1 Quinn:** C-2 and C-4, now is //not// the time! //[To Gægr over comms.]// Gægr, get out of there!

**«02:12:44»** WHITE NETHER clamps onto C-0's tail. Gægr twists his body and angles the unobtanium engine at the Deviant, which activates and destroys the Selachian's dorsal fin. WHITE NETHER thrashes uncontrollably, damaging and disabling the unobtanium engine. Gægr falls into a nearby building, unconscious. CHARYBDIS surrounds both Gægr and the Selachian.

**«02:13:49»** The engine destabilizes, blasting superheated chemicals onto the Selachian. It smashes the building to rubble and escapes in a Way. All five audiovisual feeds terminate simultaneously.

The Centre received a distress beacon on August 9, approximately one week after losing contact with MFT CHARYBDIS. The beacon lacked exact co-ordinates but contained the following audio file.

[[div class="inner-block"]]

[[div style="border-bottom: 1px solid black;"]]

**First Avian Entity:** If you're willing to comply, let's–

**C-1 Quinn:** Where are your owners?

**First Avian Entity:** What?

**C-1 Quinn:** Oh, you know. Humans!

**First Avian Entity:** What do you mean? We don't... //Have// humans, what are you–

**Second Avian Entity:** Quibba, I know what he means. Why don't I tell him what's going on? He may be a fiend–

**C-1 Quinn:** //Hey!//

**Second Avian Entity:** But given the circumstances, even //he// could help us.

**First Avian Entity:** Fine.

**Second Avian Entity:** A few months ago, humanity faced a daring threat and found themselves most unequipped to combat it. Their threat, an innocent memetic agent, proved insidious over time and affected large swaths of their population to no end. 

**Second Avian Entity:** That simple hazard turned into a worldwide pandemic. Young parents started to feed worms to their kin. Human language was abolished and replaced with calls and songs. Entire populations migrated hundreds of kilometres south, never to return home. I think some humans even tried to fly; you can imagine how that went. These are but a few examples of humanity's vast struggle -- one that consumed their entire species.

**Second Avian Entity:** It was as if one unruly God discarded all that defines humanity and tried to fit something primitive -- something bird-like -- into that gaping hole. Suffering came in waves, and since civilization is suited for man-kind and not bird-kind, all societal norms quickly deteriorated. Humanity ceased to be, and even the mighty Foundation fell to its knees. There is no longer such thing as a "human". 

**Second Avian Entity:** My team and I operate in one of the only minute pockets of normalcy that still exists, alongside a few other untainted resources. It is tough work, but it is our duty. And I fear that our hardships have only just begun.

**C-1 Quinn:** I don't get it.

**Second Avian Entity:** You could never hope to. Speaking of which, who are you? We did not detect the proto-Avian meme complex within you. Only an experienced thaumaturge -- perhaps even a powerful Type-Green, Medila forbid! -- could resist such a memetic threat. Tell me: What manipulation has Thoth attempted this time?

**C-1 Quinn:** //[He laughs.]// Oh, we're just visiting. My team is part of something called the Centre. We–

**First Avian Entity:** The Centre? Are you those shark-punching–

**C-1 Quinn:** How many times must a man explain himself! It's Selachian P–

**First Avian Entity:** Do not interrupt me again. Explain to me how you will pay for your crimes, thaumaturge!

**C-1 Quinn:** Listen, I'm no wizard. I'm a Pugilist. And what do you mean by "crimes"? Are you telling me we //didn't// pound that Deviant to pulp? We saved the city!

**Second Avian Entity:** Quibba makes a good point. Cease your nonsense or I will be a very cross bird. Are you willing to co-operate?

**C-1 Quinn:** //[C-1 pauses.]// Actually yeah, I am. What did you guys say you were again? Pelican birds?

**Second Avian Entity:** We are members of the Avian Division's Mobile Task Force Eta-4, code-named "Begone Thoth". I am Keshrayuth, leader of this unit.

**C-1 Quinn:** Right, about that. Where I'm from, we used birds^^**[A]**^^ like you to fight Selachians. If you're willing to supply some muscle for our war, we're gonna help you fight yours. Full co-operation on both sides. Deal?

**Second Avian Entity:** Deal.

^^**[A]**^^ This is a reference to "GALLINACEOUS STRIFE": A two-phase project developed by proto-Centre organization "The Union of American States' Center for Institutionalized Impacting" (or UASCII). Since some Avian phenotypes are natural predators of the common Selachian, GALLINACEOUS STRIFE used Avian Entities to neutralize Selachian threats.

**Phase One:** Phase one used Deviant-Type Avian Entities -- such as the "LIMP FIREBIRD" -- to engage in the sport of cockfighting with Selachian Entities. Phase one was dissolved following an extensive investigation into the project's unlawful and unethical violation of Avian rights. 

**Phase Two:** Phase two involved the creation of a dense Avian meme complex (code-named "GAUSS KESTREL") to neutralize Deviant-Type Selachian Entities. Since no actual Avian Entities were being manipulated, no Avian rights could be violated. GAUSS KESTREL was dissolved when the Avian meme complex was lost to unknown Extra-Universal forces. 

GALLINACEOUS STRIFE remains ON HIATUS to this day.
