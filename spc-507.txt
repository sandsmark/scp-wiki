++++ NOTICE FROM THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE COORDINATION AND PROJECTS OPERATION COMMAND OFFICE

SPC-507 is [[span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;"]]ACTIVE[[/span]]. 

All RED NETHER incursions are to be reported to the Command Office, at which point an authorized Marine Fighting Team will be deployed. RED NETHER threats are an EPSILON-GREEN priority, escalating to OMEGA-GREEN during a mating scenario. 

The Selachian threat known as WHITE NETHER is to be deterred at all costs.
[[/div]] 
 
**Project #:** SPC-507

**Selachian Pugnātorial Capabilities:** SPC-507 exists to train and equip Centre Pugilists for combat against Extra-Universal Selachian threats (Selachian threats from beyond our universe). Prominent threats include:

1. **__RED NETHER__**
[[div style="margin: 1.308em;"]]
RED NETHER refers to Deviant-Type Selachian Entities that manifest in nearby universes to prepare for the Mistaken Beast's eventual arrival. During the Seventh Deviant Crusade, RED NETHER Entities were found referenced in ancient Sharkicist manuscripts as "angels" and "acolytes". RED NETHER are known for sexually aggressive exhibitionist mating attacks, which are capable of causing lightning storms, even in the vacuum of space.

Centre Pugilists have consistently went on record to describe these entities as "passive-aggressive", "demonic", and even "sassy". 
[[/div]]

2. **__WHITE NETHER__**
[[div style="margin: 1.308em;"]]
WHITE NETHER refers to a massive individual Deviant-Type Selachian Entity with the capacity to travel between universes. 

All Centre Pugilists encountering WHITE NETHER have gone Missing in Pugnātion. WHITE NETHER reports typically include reference to "ontovoric" tendencies: WHITE NETHER consumes copious amounts of matter during its hunts. Whether this is for survival, sport, or sexually explicit purposes is unknown. WHITE NETHER's ultimate goal has not yet been determined, as all attempts at communication have resulted in summary digestion.
[[/div]]

**Project Component(s):** SPC-507 is an ongoing pugilistic operation co-developed by the Centre, Poseidon Laboratories, and [[[spc-1258|the Liberated Cetacean Union (or LCU)]]]. SPC-507 makes use of the following sub-components:

||~ Sub-Component ||~ Function ||
|| Fractal Acclimator for Spatial Heuristics (or FASH) || A long-range scanning device capable of locating Deviant-Type Selachian threats in nearby universes. Developed with the help of Poseidon Labs. ||
|| Tyson Ontic Pugnātor (or TOP) || An experimental Deviant technology capable of opening portals between different universes by "punching" through the dimensional barrier. Developed by Dr. Mike Tyson, PhD. ||
|| CERULEAN EXPANSE || Deviant-Type Cetacean Entities allied with the Centre. Each Cetacean is trained in specialized Deviant pugilism. ||
|| Marine Fighting Team CHARYBDIS || A special forces unit outfitted with biochemical and cybernetic enhancements. The team was formed following an abundantly fatal encounter between Marine Fighting Team SCYLLA frogmen and WHITE NETHER. MFT CHARYBDIS is currently stationed in Kydonia, the Kingdom of Mycenae; in an underwater geodesic dome code-named BRINE MONASTERIUM. Their prime directive is to locate and pummel WHITE NETHER. ||

**Enhancement Summary:** CERULEAN EXPANSE (//Supramagnum musculus atlanto//) is the largest species of Deviant-Type Cetacean Entities on Earth, capable of atmospheric and exospheric flight via twelve natural ramjet sphincters. The LCU has granted the Centre express permission to use CERULEAN EXPANSE in SPC-507.

The Centre has selected a single CERULEAN EXPANSE specimen ("Gægr Kemdulnim the Deep One") measuring 45 meters in length and over 180,000 kg in weight. Gægr has been outfitted with an internal cargo bay to transport a single Marine Fighting Team, their supplies, and a set of Fish Stick-Class cryonic units, as well as subdermal implants to produce internal oxygen. Gægr has been grafted with an additional propulsion system in the form of an unobtanium power extractor, granting him flight speeds of up to Mach 12 (14,800 km/h). Gægr is a veteran Cetacean pugilist trained in the esoteric pugilistic art of Yzylvin Xa, having served in the Seventh Deviant Crusade. Gægr is fluent in English, Whalish, Sharkish, and the Cetacean song-language "Balooga".

**Augmentation Summary:** MFT CHARYBDIS is a team of Centre frogmen[[footnote]]**Frogman:** A Marine Fighting Team operator, trained for combat while wearing underwater breathing equipment.[[/footnote]] enhanced with mimetic magnesium-titanium bone implants and muscular grafts extracted directly from Deviant-Type Selachian entities. After the loss of MFT SCYLLA, CHARYBDIS was given further implants in the form of epinephrine emitters that yield a 200% increase in adrenal gland activity during high-stress scenarios.

MFT CHARYBDIS uses prototype NEUROKNOCK powered armour, which consists of a high-durability vacuum-sealed tungsten carbide exoskeleton capable of enhancing pugilistic force by a factor of three. NEUROKNOCK is outfitted with a 12-hour oxygen scrubber and rebreather, heating and cooling systems, digital radio transmitter, and Selachian identification HUD. Each suit is also powered with a miniaturized unobtanium power extractor, which fuels a back-mounted rocket pack.

**Context:** The following is a list of notable SPC-507 project deployments. Deployment records use the following format: Mission Number, Universe Designation, Case(s) of Interest, and Commentary.
[[/div]]

[[div class="quote-block"]]
**Mission Number:** 13

**Universe Designation:** Tri-Kaa

**Case(s) of Interest:** RED NETHER

**Commentary:** MFT CHARYBDIS' FASH device informed them of a RED NETHER incursion nearby universe designated Tri-Kaa. The Selachian, a Great Hammerhead (//Sphyrna mokarran//), measured 4 meters in length. Upon arriving, MFT CHARYBDIS entered orbit around an Earth-sized planet covered with 99% water. CHARYBDIS detected the Entity 8,000 km away in geosynchronous orbit.

**C-0 Gægr:** //[In the middle of song.]// RED NETHER is nigh, too close for comfort. Space dust, fleeting, in front and in the way. Assemble, my cohorts, and we'll make this Selachian pay!

**C-3 Leah:** Oh, Gægr, that was your most beautiful song yet! Okay, boss, what are the orders?

**C-1 Quinn:** Right, team. We're gonna exit C-0 in approximately 30 seconds. C-4, you take flank. I need you to determine the best way to engage with the enemy. C-2, take point. C-3, I want you to watch C-2's back. We good, team?

**C-3 Leah:** Aye, aye, captain!

**C-4 Haruki:** Ready to engage, sir.

**C-2 Jaedan:** //[Grumbling.]// On it.

//[MFT CHARYBDIS exits C-0 and travels 500 meters to the Selachian's position, dodging orbital detritus. C-4 makes a wide sweep and views the Selachian from a distance.]//

**C-4 Haruki:** The Selachian is taking defensive measures and is rotated axially, 46 degrees downward. I suggest Advanced Pugilistic Technique-63, 11th Edition update. You know what that means.

**C-2 Jaedan:** We'll handle it. Leah, grab my hand, I'm going to swing you upwards and you're going to punt that Deviant straight in the snout.

**C-3 Leah:** Are you sure about this, Ruki? Technique-63 is to be used explicitly in situations of panic or extreme adversity, and there's not much evidence it works unless it's a critical hit. Ruki-chan's been watching Shark Month lately, huh Jae?

**C-2 Jaedan:** //[Laughing.]//

**C-4 Haruki:** It's not up for discussion, Leah, the Selachian's about to attack!

//[C-2 takes C-3's hand and swings her upwards in the direction of the Selachian, using his rocket pack to launch her at a high speed. C-3 is about to make contact when the Selachian banks left, causing her to sail into the distance. The Selachian emits radio signals at a low frequency, which have been translated after the mission.]//

**RED NETHER Entity:** [Translation: MEAT SACKS. WHERE CAN A SHARK LIKE ME FIND A HOT SINGLE IN THIS AREA? PLEASE, IT HAS BEEN 6 MONTHS. I AM NOT KIDDING, WHAT IF I MISS MATING SEASON? I AM ACTUALLY GOING TO DIE.]

**C-2 Jaedan:** This freak does not look pretty! Leah, keep your distance, I'm performing Technique-21.

//[C-2 propels himself toward the Selachian at 115 km/h, performing a pugilistic technique at the base of the Selachian's skull.]//

**RED NETHER Entity:** [Translation: FUCK, BUDDY, WHAT IN THE DEPTHS IS WRONG WITH YOU? I HAVE FEELINGS TOO, YOU KNOW. THAT HAD BETTER NOT BRUISE, IT IS HARD ENOUGH TO GET A DATE LOOKING AS DUMB AS I DO AS IT IS.]

//[The Selachian begins to attack by biting down on the leg of C-2's armour but is unsuccessful. In the next 3 minutes, C-2 lands 124 attacks. The Selachian goes unconscious.]//

**C-1 Quinn:** Job's done, team. Head back to C-0. Now, this is against regulation, but... Why don't we explore that planet down there and see what we can eat? Maybe sea cows aren't extinct on this world.

**Mission Number:** 54

**Universe Designation:** Penta-Waxaklahun

**Case(s) of Interest:** Bee Obliteration Registry "K" (BORK)

**Commentary:** MFT CHARYBDIS is alerted to a RED NETHER attack in Universe Penta-Waxaklahun. MFT deploys to a city on a small terrestrial planet inhabited by humanoid entities. After pugilising the Selachian into submission, the humanoids celebrate, thanking MFT CHARYBDIS for their help.

//[Recording takes place between C-1 and the leader of this particular group of humanoids.]//

**C-1 Quinn:** So, you're saying that your men... Swat //bees//? How could someone hate bees?

**Humanoid Leader:** I strongly urge that you police your speech around my citizens. I do not wish to cause an incident. And it is not merely that the Registry prostrates itself to "swat" bees. My, phrasing on a level this unsophisticated is nearly as problematic as the false thoughts about bee-kind you have been indoctrinated to oviposit so effortlessly.

**C-1 Quinn:** Don't talk down to me, boy, unless you want to spar with me instead. And about this bee situation -- I've smelt your air, your people haven't had a flower bloom in decades!

**Humanoid Leader:** Bees pose a serious existential threat, one that will halt all other life in wide swaths with just a passing glance. Bees are a repulsive abomination, most repellent, and we are to obliterate them all, no matter the cost. The Apiarchy takes no prisoners, not even you or I, soldier. I assure you, this work is commanded by the Heavens. And we are doing //excellent// work.

**C-1 Quinn:** I think we're done here.

//[Meanwhile, nearby, C4-Haruki consumes an unknown beverage.]//

**C-4 Haruki:** This is //great//! What is it?

**Unknown Humanoid:** This brew, most tantalizing, was extracted from a pod of the finest powdered seed we have, staled for the ages to produce maximum bitterness.

**C-4 Haruki:** So it's just coffee? Oh. //[Takes another sip.]// You wouldn't happen to have any honey, would you? I like my coffee a little sweet.

**Unknown Humanoid:** How dare you utter words tainted by the Striped Yellow Fiend? Guards, arrest this enchantress and her accomplices at once!

**C-1 Quinn:** //C-4, what did you do?!// Quick, rendezvous with C-0 and let's get the hell out of here!

**«01:57:08»** //[The Statue of Liberty taking an Avian form can be seen, with a placard denoting that it is the "Statue of Libirdty". WHITE NETHER begins to consume the monument.]//

**C-1 Quinn:** You Deviant maniac, you're destroying the Statue of Libirdty! Damn you to the depths!

**«02:00:23»** //[C-0 moves towards WHITE NETHER at a high speed. WHITE NETHER attempts to dodge the attack, knocking debris from the statue, which rains down onto spectators below. The spectators emit birdlike vocalizations as they flee.]//

**«02:01:16»** //[C-0 readies for a second attack and attempts to pummel WHITE NETHER head-on. WHITE NETHER retaliates by spinning its body around, using its tail to knock C-0 into the waters below.]//

**«02:01:58»** //[WHITE NETHER dives into the water. C-0 bites WHITE NETHER's tail. In the ensuing panic, WHITE NETHER exits the water with C-0's mouth still enveloping the tail.]//

**«02:05:18»** //[WHITE NETHER pulls C-0 into the city of Manhattan, reaching 200 km/h. C-0 continues to bite the tail. WHITE NETHER skims many skyscrapers, causing C-0 to destroy buildings and monuments across the city. WHITE NETHER travels towards the Riverside Church in Upper Manhattan. C-0 opens his jaw, releasing WHITE NETHER, and both C-0 and WHITE NETHER smash into the church at 150 km/h. The church's large bell falls onto WHITE NETHER, immobilizing it.]//

**«02:09:36»** //[After recuperating from the impact, C-0 engages in pugilistic retaliation, swinging his pectoral fins into WHITE NETHER with extreme force. C-0 lands 15 blows before WHITE NETHER bites down on C-0's left pectoral fin, bisecting and consuming it. In a panicked state, C-0 pushes WHITE NETHER through the church, smashing a hole in a stucco wall. The two exit through the other side of the church and fall into the street.]//

**«02:10:31»** //[C-0 bites WHITE NETHER's tail once more and attempts to consume it. WHITE NETHER vocalizes in pain. WHITE NETHER's tail is decimated from the caudal keel beyond. WHITE NETHER turns bright red. MFT CHARYBDIS argues about what could be happening.]//

**C-2 Jaedan:** Uh oh, it's starting a rage state!

**C-4 Haruki:** That's not a thing!

**C-2 Jaedan:** It is absolutely a thing, I'm 110% positive.

**C-4 Haruki:** You can't be more than 100% positive, you bottom feeder.

**C-1 Quinn:** C-2 and C-4, cease. C-0, get us out of here!

**«02:12:44»** //[C-0 attempts to escape. WHITE NETHER bites C-0's tail, preventing an exit. In an attempt to reduce further attacks, C-0 uses the unobtanium power extractor in an offensive manner, decimating WHITE NETHERS's 2nd dorsal fin. WHITE NETHER thrashes C-0, causing the unobtanium engine to malfunction, knocking C-0 into a nearby building.]//

**«02:13:49»** //[The engine undergoes a destabilization. The engine blasts superheated unobtanium onto WHITE NETHER. In an attempt to escape, WHITE NETHER smashes the building into rubble before de-manifesting. The transmission ends, suggesting a total engine meltdown.]//

++++ FROM THE DESK OF ORACLE

The following audio was received by the Centre on August 9, 2018, approximately 1 week after the loss of communication with MFT CHARYBDIS. The full context of this log cannot be determined.

[[/div]]

**First Avian Entity:** Now that you're willing to comply, let's–

**C-1 Quinn:** Where are your captors?

**First Avian Entity:** What?

**C-1 Quinn:** You know, your humans.

**First Avian Entity:** What do you mean? We don't... //Have// humans, what are you–

**Second Avian Entity:** It's okay, Quibba, I understand what he's getting at. Why don't I tell him what's going on? He may be a fiend–

**C-1 Quinn:** //Hey!//

**Second Avian Entity:** –but given the circumstances, even //he// could become an effective ally.

**First Avian Entity:** Go.

**Second Avian Entity:** A few months ago, humanity was faced with a dubious threat while remaining most unequipped to combat it. Their threat, an innocent memetic agent, proved to be quite insidious over time, affecting large swaths of the population to no end. 

**Second Avian Entity:** A memetic hazard turned worldwide pandemic with most confusing effects: parents began to feed worms to their children; human languages were abolished, replaced with calls and songs; entire population centres migrated hundreds of kilometres elsewhere, never to return to their homes. I think some humans even tried to fly; you can imagine how that went. Those are but a few examples in this vast predicament. A predicament that now affects all of humanity.

**Second Avian Entity:** It was as if one unruly God discarded all that defines humanity and tried to fit something primitive, dare I say birdlike, in that newly emptied void. There was initially no suffering, but since civilization is suited for man-kind and not bird-kind, all societal norms quickly deteriorated, and the world as it was known ceased to be. Even the mighty Foundation was forever changed. As such, there is no longer such thing as a "human". 

**Second Avian Entity:** My team and I operate in some of the only minute pockets of normalcy that remain, alongside a few other untainted resources. It is tough work, but it is our duty. And I fear this is only the beginning of our hardships.

**C-1 Quinn:** I don't get it.

**Second Avian Entity:** You could never hope to. Speaking of which, who are you? We did not detect the proto-Avian meme complex within you. experienced thaumaturges — perhaps even a powerful Type-Green, Medila forbid! — could resist such a memetic threat. Tell me, what manipulation has Thoth attempted this time?

**C-1 Quinn:** I'm not from around here. My team is part of an organization known as the Centre.

**First Avian Entity:** The Centre? Are you those shark-punching–

**C-1 Quinn:** How many times must a man explain himself? It's Selachian P–

**First Avian Entity:** Do not interrupt me again. Explain to me how you will pay for your crimes, thaumaturge!

**C-1 Quinn:** Listen, I'm no wizard. I'm a Pugilist. And, what do you mean by "crimes"? Are you telling me you didn't see the massive Great White attack? We saved the city!

**Second Avian Entity:** Quibba makes a good point. Cease your nonsense or you will find this conversation very difficult. Are you willing to co-operate with us or not?

**C-1 Quinn:** //[C-1 pauses.]// Actually, yeah, I am. Now, what did you guys say you were? Pelican birds?

**Second Avian Entity:** We are members of the Avian Division's Mobile Task Force-Eta-4, codenamed "Begone Thoth". I am Keshrayuth, leader of this unit.

**C-1 Quinn:** Right, about that. Where I'm from, we used birds^^**[A]**^^ like you to fight Selachians. If you're willing to supply some muscle for our war, we will help you fight yours. That means full co-operation on both sides. Deal?

**Second Avian Entity:** Deal.

^^**[A]**^^ This is a reference to GALLINACEOUS STRIFE, a two-phase project developed during the Seventh Deviant Crusade by the proto-Centre organization known as "The Union of American States' Center for Institutionalised Impacting" (or UASCII). GALLINACEOUS STRIFE was dedicated to the use of Avian Entities to neutralize Selachian Entities, as some Avian phenotypes are known predators of Selachians. 

**Phase One:** Phase One utilized Deviant-Type Avian Entities, such as the LIMP FIREBIRD, to engage in the sport of cockfighting with Selachian Entities. Phase One was dissolved following an extensive investigation into the project's unlawful and unethical violation of Avian rights. 

**Phase Two:** Phase Two involved the creation of a dense Avian meme complex (codenamed GAUSS KESTREL) to neutralize Selachian Entities. Since no actual Avians were being manipulated, no Avian rights could be violated. GAUSS KESTREL was dissolved when the Avian meme complex was lost to unknown Extra-Universal forces. As a result, GALLINACEOUS STRIFE remains on HIATUS to this day.
