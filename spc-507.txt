Centre Pugilists are to report all RED NETHER sightings to CICAPOCO. Afterwards, an authorized Marine Fighting Team will deploy to defeat the Deviant in combat. RED NETHER threats are an EPSILON-GREEN priority, escalating to OMEGA-GREEN during a courtship ritual.

We must deter the Selachian threat known as WHITE NETHER at all costs.

+++ Selachian Pugnātorial Capabilities
----
SPC-507 exists to train and equip Centre Pugilists for combat against Selachian threats from beyond our universe. The success of SPC-507 against prominent threats is as follows:

1. **“__RED NETHER__”**

> **Selachian Threat Description:** RED NETHER refers to Deviant-Type Selachian entities that manifest in nearby universes to prepare for the eventual arrival of the Mistaken Beast. RED NETHER are known for their overly aggressive exhibitionist courtship rituals. These rituals can create lightning storms, even in the vacuum of space.
> 
> The Centre pilfered several Sharkicist manuscripts during the Seventh Deviant Crusade, and inside these documents, found references to RED NETHER entities as angels and acolytes. During field incidents, however, Centre Pugilists have consistently gone on record to describe these entities as demonic, passive-aggressive, and even sassy.
> 
> **SPC Impact Rate:** [[span class="rev-green"]]HIGH[[/span]]

2. **“__WHITE NETHER__”**

> **Selachian Threat Description:** WHITE NETHER refers to a massive Deviant-Type Selachian entity with the ability to travel between universes. WHITE NETHER reports typically include references to its ontovoric tendencies -- the Selachian consumes copious amounts of matter during its hunts. Whether these tendencies exist for survival, sport, or carnal purposes is as-yet-unknown.
> 
> Sharkic cultist holy scriptures avoid reference to WHITE NETHER when possible. When mentioned, WHITE NETHER is given the moniker “The Great Daemon”. Its goal has not yet been determined, as all attempts at communication have resulted in summary digestion. All Centre Pugilists encountering WHITE NETHER have gone Missing in Pugnātion.

+++ Project Components
----
SPC-507 is an ongoing pugilistic operation co-developed by the Centre, Poseidon Laboratories, and [[[spc-1258|the Liberated Cetacean Union]]] (LCU). The focus of SPC-507 is to find, track down, and pummel RED NETHER entities and deter -- or neutralize -- the WHITE NETHER threat.

To that end, SPC-507 makes use of four sub-components:

||~ Sub-Component ||~ Function ||
||~ Fractal Acclimation/Spatial Heuristic device (“FASH”) || A long-range scanner capable of locating Deviant-Type Selachian threats in nearby universes. Developed with the help of Poseidon Labs. ||
||~ Tyson Ontic Pugnātor || An experimental Deviant technology capable of opening portals to different branch universes by punching through the dimensional barrier. Developed by Dr. Mike Tyson, PhD. ||
||~ “CERULEAN EXPANSE” || Deviant-Type Cetacean entities allied with the Centre. Each Cetacean is trained in specialized Deviant pugilism. The LCU has granted the Centre express permission to use CERULEAN EXPANSE in pugilistic operations. ||
||~ Marine Fighting Team CHARYBDIS ||A special forces unit outfitted with biochemical and cybernetic enhancements. The team formed after an abundantly fatal encounter between Marine Fighting Team SCYLLA frogmen and WHITE NETHER. MFT CHARYBDIS is stationed in Kydonia, the Kingdom of Mycenae, in an underwater geodesic dome code-named “BRINE MONASTERIUM”. _
 _
Their prime directive is to defeat WHITE NETHER.||
----
+++ Enhancement Summary
----
CERULEAN EXPANSE (//Supramagnum musculus atlanto//) is the largest species of Deviant-Type Cetacean entities on Earth, capable of atmospheric and exospheric flight via 12 natural ramjet sphincters. The Centre has selected one CERULEAN EXPANSE specimen, named Gægr Kemdulnim The Deep One, who measures 45 m in length and over 180 000 kg in mass.

Gægr has been outfitted with an internal cargo bay to transport one Marine Fighting Team, their supplies, and a set of Fish Stick-Class cryogenic units. Gægr has also been grafted with an unobtanium power extractor acting as an added propulsion system, which grants flight speeds of up to Mach 12 (14 800 km/h). He is also equipped with subdermal implants to produce internal oxygen.

Having served in the Seventh Deviant Crusade, Gægr is a veteran Cetacean pugilist trained in the Deviant pugilistic art of Yzylvin Xa. Gægr is fluent in English, Whalish, Sharkish, and the Cetacean song-language “Balooga”.
----
+++ Augmentation Summary
----
MFT CHARYBDIS is a team of Centre frogmen[[footnote]]**Frogman:** A Marine Fighting Team operator, trained for combat while wearing underwater breathing equipment.[[/footnote]] enhanced with magnesium-titanium mimetic bone implants and muscular grafts extracted from Deviant-Type Selachian entities. After the loss of MFT SCYLLA, CHARYBDIS received further implants in the form of epinephrine emitters that yield a 200% increase in adrenal gland activity during high-stress scenarios.

CHARYBDIS uses prototype NEUROKNOCK powered armour. The armour consists of a high-durability vacuum-sealed tungsten carbide exoskeleton, capable of enhancing pugilistic force by a factor of three. NEUROKNOCK is outfitted with a 12-hr oxygen scrubber and rebreather, heating and cooling systems, digital radio transmitter, and Selachian identification HUD. Each suit is powered with a miniaturized unobtanium power extractor, which fuels a back-mounted rocket pack.

[[div class="blockquote"]]
**Mission Number:** 13

**Universe Designation:** Tri-Kaa

**Case of Interest:** RED NETHER

**Commentary:** MFT CHARYBDIS' FASH device detected a RED NETHER incursion in a nearby universe.

On arrival, CHARYBDIS entered orbit around an Earth-sized terrestrial planet with water covering ~99% of its surface. CHARYBDIS detected the entity -- a 4-m-long Great Hammerhead Selachian (//Sphyrna mokarran//) -- in a geosynchronous orbit, 8 000 km away.

**CICAPOCO Notice:** In a post-mission analysis, technicians discovered that the Selachian emitted low-frequency radio signals at specific intervals. Decoded translations are supplied where possible.

**C-1 Quinn:** All right staff, C-0 is gonna open that mouth of his in 30 seconds. Is that right, Gægr?

**C-0 Gægr:** @@[@@//He moans with glee.//@@]@@

**C-1 Quinn:** As soon as you get out there, I want C-4 to take flank. She'll know what to do when she's in position. C-2, you take point, and C-3, I need you to watch his back. We good, team?

**C-3 Leah:** Aye, aye, captain!

**C-4 Haruki:** Ready to engage, sir!

**C-2 Jaedan:** @@[@@//He merely grumbles.//@@]@@

@@[@@//MFT CHARYBDIS exits Gægr and travels 500 m while dodging orbital detritus. C-4 Haruki sweeps wide and analyzes the Selachian from a distance.//@@]@@

**C-4 Haruki (COM):** That Deviant bastard's taking defensive measures! I suggest Advanced Pugilistic Technique-63, 11th Edition update. You know what that means.

**C-2 Jaedan (COM):** Leah, grab my hand; I'm gonna swing you upwards. When you get there, you'll punt that Deviant straight in the snout!

**C-3 Leah (COM):** Are you sure about this, 'Ruki? Technique-63 is used explicitly in situations of panic or extreme adversity, and there's not much evidence it works unless it's a critical hit. 'Ruki-chan's been watching Shark Month lately, huh Jae?

@@[@@//C-2 Jaedan laughs.//@@]@@

**C-4 Haruki (COM):** It's not up for discussion, Leah, it's about to attack!

@@[@@//Jaedan grips C-3 Leah's hand, swings her toward the Selachian, and launches her at tremendous speed with his rocket thrusters. Before making contact, the Selachian heels to starboard, and she sails right past.//@@]@@

**RED NETHER Entity:** [Translation: MEAT SACKS. WHERE CAN A SHARK LIKE ME FIND A HOT SINGLE IN THIS AREA? PLEASE, IT HAS BEEN SIX MONTHS. I AM NOT KIDDING, WHAT IF I MISS MATING SEASON? I AM ACTUALLY GOING TO DIE.]

**C-2 Jaedan (COM):** This freak's an ugly bastard, isn't it? Leah, keep your distance; I'm performing Technique-21!

@@[@@//Jaedan propels toward the Selachian at 115 km/h and jabs its neck.//@@]@@

**Universe Designation:** Penta-Waxaklahun

**Case of Interest:** Bee Obliteration Registry “K” (BORK)

**Commentary:** A FASH alert signalled MFT CHARYBDIS to a RED NETHER attack in Universe Penta-Waxaklahun.

CHARYBDIS deployed to a small terrestrial planet inhabited by humanoid entities and travelled into a city, where multiple RED NETHER entities had launched an organized invasion force. After pummelling the Selachians into submission, a celebration was held.

@@[@@//The recording captures a confrontation between C-1 Quinn and the humanoid leader in a cavernous banquet hall.//@@]@@

**C-1 Quinn:** So, you're telling me that your people swat //bees// for a living?

**Humanoid Leader:** I strongly urge that you police your speech around my citizens; I don't wish to cause an incident. And it's not //merely// that the Registry prostrates itself to //swat// bees. My, phrasing on a level //this// unsophisticated is problematic, but //pales// in comparison to the false thoughts about bee-kind you've been indoctrinated to oviposit.

**C-1 Quinn:** Listen, if you're gonna talk trash, I'd rather it happen inside the sparring ring. And about this bee situation -- I've smelt your air! Your city hasn't had a flower bloom in decades!

**Humanoid Leader:** Bees pose a grave existential threat -- one that will halt all other life in vast swaths with just a passing glance! Bees are a repulsive abomination -- most repellent! And we shall obliterate them //all//, no matter the cost. The Apiarchy takes no prisoners -- not even you or me, soldier. The Heavens command our work. And we are doing //excellent// work indeed.

@@[@@//On the opposite end of the room, C-4 Haruki converses with multiple humanoid entities. The humanoids nod and dance to chest-thrumming techno music. Haruki sips a caramel-brown beverage from a Styrofoam cup.//@@]@@

**C-4 Haruki:** Holy shit, you //have to// tell me what's in this thing! It kicks //so much// ass.

**First Unknown Humanoid:** You like? This elixir was extracted from a pod of the finest powdered seed we have!

**C-4 Haruki:** @@[@@//She blinks.//@@]@@ Wait, this is just coffee? Huh, all right. @@[@@//She takes another sip.//@@]@@ You wouldn't happen to have any honey, would you? I've got a bit of a sweet tooth.

**Second Unknown Humanoid:** @@[@@//The entity points at Haruki and screams.//@@]@@ She's in bed with the pest! The Striped Yellow Fiend! Apprehend this enchantress at once!

@@[@@//All entities drop their drinks and make a beeline for the Fighting Team. The leader raises two slender fists and corners Captain Quinn.//@@]@@

@@[@@//The dance music continues.//@@]@@

**C-1 Quinn:** C-4, dammit, what did you do? @@[@@//To the rest of CHARYBDIS over comms.//@@]@@ Code FREAKISH NIGHT TERROR SUNDAE! Fall back!

**«0:00:00»** MFT CHARYBDIS appears 400 km above a planet with striking similarities to Earth. WHITE NETHER resembles a Great White Selachian (//Carcharodon carcharias//). It consumes a passing satellite.

**«0:29:47»** Having devoured its meal, WHITE NETHER descends into the atmosphere. C-0 Gægr activates his unobtanium engine and follows from a distance.

**«01:51:55»** WHITE NETHER flies above this Earth's version of Olde New York.

**«01:57:08»** WHITE NETHER pursues the Statue of Liberty. The statue displays various visual deviancies, such as a beak, feathered wings, and talons. Video magnification reveals a note scrawled onto a placard at its base: “STATUE OF LIBIRDY”. WHITE NETHER feasts on the monument.

**C-1 Quinn:** @@[@@//He yells.//@@]@@ You Deviant maniac, you're destroying the Statue of Libirdy! Oh, damn you to the depths!

@@[@@//Gægr bellows like an operatic singer.//@@]@@

**C-0 Gægr:** [[size 150%]]**♪**[[/size]] //Tonight I waltz with the Beast!// [[size 150%]]**♫**[[/size]]

**C-1 Quinn:** Damn //right//! That's it, everybody out!

**«01:59:40»** C-1 Quinn, C-2 Jaedan, C-3 Leah, and C-4 Haruki emerge from Gægr's gaping mouth and hover at rest nearby.

**«02:00:23»** Gægr spirals at a great velocity toward WHITE NETHER. WHITE NETHER heels to port and knocks debris from the statue, which rains down on humanoid entities below. The entities squawk and flee.

**«02:01:16»** Gægr reels back and rams WHITE NETHER head-on. The Selachian retaliates, spinning to confront him. It swings its tail like a battering ram, slamming Gægr into the ocean.

**«02:01:58»** WHITE NETHER dives into the bay. Gægr bites the Selachian's tail. In the ensuing panic, WHITE NETHER springs up from the water and thrashes, but Gægr holds on tight.

**«02:05:18»** WHITE NETHER pulls Gægr into the city at 200 km/h, and CHARYBDIS follows far behind. The Selachian skims atop skyscrapers; Gægr's bulk destroys buildings and monuments, but he does not let go. WHITE NETHER travels toward a church in the city's residential core.

**«02:07:09»** Gægr opens his jaw, releasing WHITE NETHER, and both smash through a church wall at 250 km/h. A church bell breaks free and lands on WHITE NETHER, immobilizing it.

**«02:09:36»** In a fit of rage, Gægr pinwheels his pectoral fins into WHITE NETHER and lands fifteen rapid blows. WHITE NETHER bites down on Gægr's left pectoral fin, bisecting and consuming it. In a panic, Gægr pushes WHITE NETHER through the church, demolishing the opposite wall. The pair falls into the street.

**«02:10:31»** Gægr chews on WHITE NETHER's tail and plucks it from the caudal keel. WHITE NETHER shines bright red.

**C-2 Jaedan:** Oh, fuck! That's a rage state!

**C-4 Haruki:** That's not a thing!

**C-2 Jaedan:** It is! I'm //110%// positive.

**C-4 Haruki:** You can't– @@[@@//She smacks her faceplate.//@@]@@ Math doesn't work that way, dumbass!

**C-1 Quinn:** C-2 and C-4, now is //not// the time! @@[@@//To Gægr over comms.//@@]@@ Gægr, get out of there!

**«02:12:44»** WHITE NETHER clamps onto Gægr's tail. He twists his body and angles the unobtanium engine at the Deviant, which activates and destroys the Selachian's dorsal fin. WHITE NETHER thrashes uncontrollably, damaging and disabling the unobtanium engine. Gægr is knocked sideways into a nearby building. Several floors collapse; Gægr falls unconscious. CHARYBDIS surrounds both Gægr and the Selachian.

**«02:13:49»** The engine destabilizes, blasting superheated chemicals onto the Selachian. WHITE NETHER smashes the building to rubble and escapes through a newly manifested Way.

**«02:13:58»** All five audiovisual feeds terminate simultaneously.

+++ FROM THE DESK OF ORACLE
----
The Centre received a distress signal on 9 August, one week after losing contact with MFT CHARYBDIS. The signal lacked exact co-ordinates but contained an audio file.

The audio file, as relayed by Giant Radio Squid (//107.9 Calamari FM//), is as follows.

**First Avian Entity:** If you're willing to comply, let's–

**C-1 Quinn:** Where are your owners?

**First Avian Entity:** What?

**C-1 Quinn:** Oh, you know. Humans!

**First Avian Entity:** What do you mean? We don't //have// humans, what are you–

**Second Avian Entity:** Quibba, I know what he means. Why don't I tell him what's going on? He might be a fiend–

**C-1 Quinn:** //Hey!//

**Second Avian Entity:** -- But given the circumstances, even //he// could help us.

**First Avian Entity:** Fine.

**Second Avian Entity:** Some months ago, humanity faced a daring threat and found themselves most unequipped to combat it. Their threat, an innocent memetic agent, proved insidious over time and affected large swaths of their population to no end.

**Second Avian Entity:** That simple hazard turned into a worldwide pandemic. Young parents started feeding worms to their kin. Human language was abolished and replaced with calls and songs. Entire populations migrated hundreds of kilometres south, never to return home. I think some humans even tried flying; you can imagine how that went. These are but a few examples of humanity's vast struggle -- one that consumed their entire species.

**Second Avian Entity:** It was as if one unruly God discarded all that defines humanity and tried to fit something primitive -- something bird-like -- into that gaping hole. Suffering came in waves, and because civilization is suited for humankind and not bird-kind, all societal norms quickly deteriorated. Humanity ceased to be, and even the mighty Foundation fell to its knees. There is no longer such a thing as human.

**Second Avian Entity:** My team and I operate in one of the only minute pockets of normalcy that still exists, alongside a few other untainted resources. It is arduous work, but it is our duty. And I fear our hardships have only just begun.

**C-1 Quinn:** I don't get it.

**Second Avian Entity:** You could never hope to. Speaking of which, who are you? We did not detect the proto-Avian meme complex within you. Only an experienced thaumaturge -- perhaps even a powerful Type-Green, Medila forbid! -- could resist such a memetic threat. Tell me: What manipulation has Thoth attempted this time?

**C-1 Quinn:** @@[@@//He laughs.//@@]@@ Oh, we're just visiting. My team is part of something called the Centre. We–

**First Avian Entity:** The Centre? Are you those shark-punching–

**C-1 Quinn:** Come on! How many times must a man explain himself? It's Selachian Pugilism!

**First Avian Entity:** Do not interrupt me again. Explain how you will pay for your crimes, thaumaturge!

**C-1 Quinn:** Listen, I'm no wizard. I'm a Pugilist. And what do you mean by //crimes//? Are you telling me we //didn't// pound that Deviant to pulp? We saved the city!

**Second Avian Entity:** Quibba makes a good point. Cease your nonsense, or I will be a very cross bird. Are you willing to co-operate?

@@[@@//Pause.//@@]@@

**C-1 Quinn:** Actually yeah, I am. What did you say you were, again? Pelican birds?

**Second Avian Entity:** We are members of the Avian Division's Mobile Task Force Eta-4, code-named “Begone Thoth”. I am Keshrayuth, leader of this unit.

**C-1 Quinn:** Right, about that. Where I'm from, we used birds^^**[A]**^^ like you to fight Selachians. If you're willing to supply some muscle for our war, we're gonna help you fight yours. Full co-operation on both sides. Deal?

**Second Avian Entity:** Deal.

**[A]** This is a reference to “GALLINACEOUS STRIFE”: A two-phase project developed by the proto-Centre organization “Union of American States' Center for Institutionalized Impacting” (UASCII). Because some Avian phenotypes are natural predators of the common Selachian, GALLINACEOUS STRIFE used Avian entities to neutralize Selachian threats.

**Phase One:** Phase one used Deviant-Type Avian entities, like the “LIMP FIREBIRD”, to engage in the sport of cockfighting with Selachian entities. Phase one was dissolved after an extensive investigation into the project's unlawful and unethical violation of Avian rights.

**Phase Two:** Phase two involved the creation of a dense Avian meme complex (code-named “GAUSS KESTREL”) to neutralize Deviant-Type Selachian entities. Because no actual Avian entities were being manipulated, no Avian rights could be violated. GAUSS KESTREL was dissolved when the Avian meme complex was lost to unknown Extra-Universal forces.

GALLINACEOUS STRIFE remains ON HIATUS to this day.
