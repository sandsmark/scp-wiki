[[tab Overview]]
**Foreword:** The following document was recovered by Agent ████████ on ███. ██, 1954.  ████████ claims he was given the note by another agent whom he did not recognize.  Full account of the incident can be found in Document GOI-006-001: "Nobody: First Appearance".

The text details information on the supposed group or individual entity referred to as "Nobody."  The information is vague and inconclusive.  Known information includes:
* No two individuals operating under the alias "Nobody" have been seen active at the same time.
* Frequently, though not always, "Nobody" appears to be an elderly male Caucasian, dressed in a grey or black suit.
* "Nobody" often provides unwarranted assistance to the Foundation, while other times is antagonistic.  "Nobody" is usually non-hostile.

Agents are required to immediately report any individual matching this description or self-identifying as "Nobody."  Caution is recommended when dealing with this entity.  Command will decide appropriate reaction to "Nobody" on a case-by-case basis.


**Original Text as Follows:**


Dear Sirs and Madams of the Foundation,

I hope that this letter finds you well.  You do not know who am yet, however, I fear that our paths will cross many times in the future.  I am sending you this letter with the wish that our relationship will not be entirely hostile.

Of course, I know that your organization can never officially adopt a policy other than open conflict with me, simply due to my very nature.  For this reason, I hope to address not the Foundation as an organization, but as a group of individuals.  It is not my wish to involve persons in my mission who do not wish it, and our goals are not entirely unaligned.  Therefore, on those inevitable days that we meet in the field, I hope that you will remain amicable with me.  It is for the safety of you and yours that I ask this.

In order to demonstrate my goodwill, I will endeavor to reveal some truths about myself.  In this career, as you surely understand by now, secrets are a form of strength, and I hope that this debilitation will be a gateway towards copacetic relations.

Surely, the first question you must have is the question of who I am.  Unfortunately, this is a difficult answer for anyone to give, and perhaps more difficult for me than most.  While not an entirely honest answer, the best response I can give is that I am a person.  Typically, I will be an elderly male Caucasian, clothed in a grey suit and fedora.  This will not always be the case.  I realize this answer is not entirely adequate, but I hope that you will trust that it is the only response I can give.

The next question of import is my agenda.  Again, I cannot truly answer that question, as I do not know the answer myself.  Often, you will find that our objectives will overlap.  In those cases, I will endeavor to assist you with the best of my ability.  In other times, we will surely be in conflict.  I hope that you will not cause this conflict to escalate too dramatically.  The desire to keep these conflicts minimal is the main reason as to why I pen this letter.

And now, the final question, and perhaps the most important and enlightening one.  My motivations, or why I am doing this.  Here at last is an answer I can give without imprecision.  I am not whole in the way that others are.  I am not the significant in the way that others are.  I am unable to affect the world in the way others are.  I suppose you can say that I am a nobody.  All my efforts are an attempt to undermine these truths.

I would also like to inform you that I currently act alone.  However, it has come to my attention that there may be others that share my unique qualities.  In the future I hope to work alongside them, although it is equally likely that I will always be merely an individual.

At this moment, I am certain that you are beginning to question the veracity of this letter, and the information that it provides.  Your organization has made many enemies.  This could be a trick or a falsity.  Unfortunately, I cannot offer any concrete proof at this time.  You will have to accept on faith that I exist and that this information is accurate.

However, I do hope that you will take my message to heart.  Fate may have set us at odds, but that does not mean that we have to accept it.


With All Due Respect,

A Nobody

[[tab Information]]
Writing for Nobody presents a unique challenge.  One of Nobody's core themes (and possibly the only theme that is consistent among all his appearances) is "Mystery."  Unlike the other GOI's, which are relatively straightforward in their motivations and methods, Nobody has tons of varying interpretations.  In many of his incarnations, the reader is never 100% sure who he is or what his motives are.  In his appearances where you do learn his true nature, he's been everything from a lie made up by SCP Agents to avoid punishment, to the true form of SCP-055, to secretly the leader of all the major GOI's.

So, the first step to writing anything about this GOI is figuring out who is Nobody, what his/its/their/ goals are, and how they are going about accomplishing those goals.  Even if you don't reveal this information to the readers, I believe that authors need to know in order to focus our writing.
