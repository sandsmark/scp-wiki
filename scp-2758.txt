**Item #:** SCP-2758

**Object Class:** Safe[[footnote]] Potential Neutralized Object Class pending discussion. A proposal to classify SCP-2758-A individually has been submitted to Site-42 Director Radford.[[/footnote]]

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2758's effects were inherently limited to Room G14, Safe-Class Containment Wing A4, Site-42; SCP-2758-A, the only remaining component of SCP-2758, is required to remain in Room G14. No attempt should be made to remove SCP-2758-A from Room G14 through any means.

Room G14 has been equipped with a table, chair, and microphone rig for the purposes of interviewing SCP-2758-A. Room G14 is to remain closed and locked at all times, including during interviews; its door control mechanism has been programmed to accept a custom identification card in accordance with standard humanoid anomaly containment protocols, which is kept in Safe-class locker #2758 in Site-42. Access to SCP-2758 documentation is restricted to personnel with clearance level 2 or higher and personnel with special research permissions. --Requests for activation of SCP-2758 may be submitted to the Site-42 Multi-U Dept. by persons with level 3 or higher clearance only.--

Update 07/22/18: Due to SCP-2758-A's inability to corporeally exist outside of Room G14, the room has been modified in accordance with the specifications of a standard humanoid anomaly containment chamber.

**Description:** SCP-2758 was an anomalous process which could be initiated only by entering Room G14 of Safe-Class Containment Wing A4 in Site-42. Upon entry, the subject would in all cases hear a conversation[[footnote]] No visual indication of who was speaking was noted in any tests conducted; however, subjects reported that the directional source of speech changed in accordance with the speakers' corresponding positions in the room. [[/footnote]] in which two individuals arranged a third individual at the center of the room and prepared for a specifically designed thaumaturgic process[[footnote]] See addenda for details. [[/footnote]] to occur.

After this point -- 3 minutes and 33 seconds following initiation of a given cycle -- a male human, designated SCP-2758-A, would manifest nude in the center of the room. Aetheric resonance imaging indicated a strong burst of thaumaturgic particles would accompany SCP-2758-A's manifestation and dissipate outward within 3 meters of the manifestation point. In all cases, SCP-2758-A would demanifest 3-7 seconds after initial appearance[[footnote]]This would always occur instantaneously and leave no evidence of SCP-2758-A's presence.[[/footnote]], following a localized[[footnote]] Confined to within a 3.0m radius of SCP-2758-A. [[/footnote]] Hume level fluctuation of between 30 and 80. No further anomalous activity would occur past this point unless Room G14 was exited and reentered, thus initiating the SCP-2758 sequence again.

SCP-2758-A's demanifestation was found to be avoidable if the observer exited the room immediately following manifestation and reentered once Hume readings restabilized. --For indeterminate reasons,-- SCP-2758-A cannot exit Room G14, as it will always demanifest upon passing through the doorway, resulting in a Hume level fluctuation of between 50 and 60 before returning to baseline. A total of 19 attempts to isolate SCP-2758-A from both the SCP-2758 process and Room G14 have taken place since SCP-2758's discovery; no attempts were successful. Reality anchors used were unable to isolate SCP-2758-A and its immediate surroundings due to a recurring Fold Selection Continuity Error[[footnote]]An error in which a device with reality anchor components is incapable of performing said function due to an inability to discern between baseline reality and an overlapping one.[[/footnote]] which rendered both devices put to use inoperable and physically harmed SCP-2758-A in three cases.

As of 07/22/18, SCP-2758-A is permanently contained in Room G14; as such, the greater SCP-2758 process no longer functions, and SCP-2758-A is the only remaining component of the anomaly. It is hypothesized that SCP-2758 would return to its default state if SCP-2758-A were removed from the room and thus forcibly demanifested.

SCP-2758 was discovered when Researcher M. Wickerford entered Room G14 in order to prepare it for containment of SCP-████ on 07/10/18. Upon experiencing the SCP-2758 auditory anomaly, she immediately exited the room without allowing the cycle to complete. SCP-████ was contained in a different room on the wing, and within the following hours, a preliminary research team for SCP-2758 had been formed. For details, see below.

//The following is a transcript of the conversation recorded by D-8239's body microphone upon activation of SCP-2758. As the first 3 minutes and 33 seconds of the SCP-2758 process are the exact same in any given iteration, this log serves as an accurate transcription of all documented SCP-2758 activity prior to the point at which SCP-2758-A manifests.//

//On 07/22/18, SCP-2758-A was successfully isolated from the SCP-2758 process for the first time; D-8239 was instructed to exit the room immediately after SCP-2758-A's manifestation, and Dr. Wickerford entered the room once Hume readings had stopped fluctuating. SCP-2758-A did not abruptly demanifest as with previous tests. As such, it is the current consensus of research staff that the stability of SCP-2758-A's manifestation is directly dependent on observation taking place immediately before and after local reality destabilization occurs.//

> 
> //SCP-2758-A appears startled.//
> 
> **14:13:10 | SCP-2758-A:** Yeah. Are, uh, you holding clothes?
> 
> **14:13:14 | Dr. Wickerford:** Yes, of course.
> 
> //Researcher Wickerford hands SCP-2758-A a standard humanoid anomaly jumpsuit and seats herself at the table while it dresses.//
> 
> **14:13:38 | SCP-2758-A:** Okay, thank you. I swear I was wearing clothes last I knew, but the room's changed quite a bit too.
> 
> **14:13:45 | Dr. Wickerford:** Can you provide us with any information on how you appeared here?
> 
> **14:13:49 | SCP-2758-A:** I came here on purpose. I didn't think through what that would entail, though, fuck.
> 
> **14:13:55 | Dr. Wickerford:** Where is 'here'?
> 
> **14:13:58 | SCP-2758-A:** Well, I mean- You are a Foundation employee, right?
> 
> **14:14:01 | Dr. Wickerford:** Yes. You intentionally sought out Foundation activity?
> 
> //SCP-2758-A is silent for several seconds.//
> 
> **14:14:22 | SCP-2758-A:** I'm sorry, I'm really regretting things right now.
> 
> **14:14:28 | Dr. Wickerford:** You don't have to answer questions immediately.
> 
> **14:14:32 | SCP-2758-A:** Yeah. Alright.
> 
> //SCP-2758-A leans over, breathing heavily.//
> 
> **14:14:41 | SCP-2758-A:** I don't feel so great. Shit, okay.
> 
> **14:14:44 | Dr. Wickerford:** Take your time. Would you rather be escorted to the medical-
> 
> **14:14:47 | SCP-2758-A:** No, no, I just- I'm freaking out. We were so high when we did that. I didn't think it would work. Did it work? Am I just tripping really hard right now? I mean, I know we all knew our stuff, don't get me wrong, but-
> 
> //SCP-2758-A leans against the wall, swaying.//
> 
> **14:15:00 | Dr. Wickerford:** Okay, you know what, let's prioritize medical and continue this at a later point. You don't look stable.
> 
> //Researcher Wickerford calls for two security personnel to escort SCP-2758-A out of the room. SCP-2758-A complies, but demanifests as it exits the room; as its head passes through the boundary between the space inside of Room G14 and the space in the hallway outside, a cross-section of its body is visible to personnel in the hallway and visible on security feeds before it falls forward out of the room and demanifests completely with the exception of its clothing.//

> //D-8239 leaves a jumpsuit on the interview table before exiting Room G14. Researcher Wickerford enters after a delay of one minute in an effort to allow SCP-2758-A time to dress. Hume levels are baseline.//
> 
> **16:26:03 | Dr. Wickerford:** Hello, SCP-2758-A.
> 
> **16:26:06 | SCP-2758-A:** Hi.
> 
> **16:26:08 | Dr. Wickerford:** Have you retained your memories of our previous interaction?
> 
> **16:26:12 | SCP-2758-A:** Uh, I suppose not.
> 
> //Researcher Wickerford seats herself at the table.//
> 
> **16:26:15 | Dr. Wickerford:** Alright, I'll try a different approach, then. If my assessment based upon our last interview is correct, you are here intentionally; your manifestation is the final component of an anomalous process that affects only this room. When someone walks in here, they overhear what is presumably you and your friends preparing for a thaumaturgic ritual of sorts. If someone is watching you for more than a second or two after you manifest, you demanifest. If you leave this room, you demanifest. Is all of this activity intentional?
> 
> **16:26:38 | SCP-2758-A:** Uh, no. Not all of it.
> 
> **16:26:41 | Dr. Wickerford:** You are aware of the existence of the SCP Foundation and intended to contact us specifically, correct?
> 
> **16:26:47 | SCP-2758-A:** Yes. We didn't think it would work. I'm going to be honest with you, I'm wondering if I'm just tripping right now.
> 
> **16:26:53 | Dr. Wickerford:** Are you under the influence of a hallucinogen? You said that last time too.
> 
> **16:26:57 | SCP-2758-A:** We each took a tab of acid before we started this shit. Made all this freaky stuff come more naturally.
> 
> **16:27:02 | Dr. Wickerford:** Noted. But what is your goal in appearing here?
> 
> **16:27:04 | SCP-2758-A:** Oh boy. Okay, uh... Are you familiar with the Pataphysics Department?
> 
> **16:27:11 | Dr. Wickerford:** I know of no such thing.
> 
> **16:27:13 | SCP-2758-A:** Wait, what clearance level are you?
> 
> **16:27:16 | Dr. Wickerford:** Four. Why is this relevant?
> 
> **16:27:18 | SCP-2758-A:** Well, I guess you might not have the right provisional clearance. Never mind. I'm probably going to explain this badly, but in my reality construct, the SCP Foundation is entirely a fiction writing project.
> 
> **16:27:24 | Dr. Wickerford:** Oh. Yes, we are generally aware of your construct. The Multi-U Department sees it as no more of an issue than any other reality construct.
> 
> **16:27:31 | SCP-2758-A:** Really? But what do you do to deal with the fact that you're fictional?
> 
> **16:27:38 | Dr. Wickerford:** We are not fictional. If we were to define our existence -- if anyone was to define their existence -- by how we are depicted in dissimilar realities, we would certainly not 'exist' at all. Thus, 'reality' is defined as //this// reality. One could argue that you are closer to unreal than I am in our current state, as is shown by your inability to exist outside of this room.[[footnote]] [Post-editing personnel behavior review: Class I minor ethics infraction (Employee Conduct, 2015 Edition, § 5: Human Anomalies: ¶ 32 -- "unnecessary antagonizing statement") -- remediated July 2018][[/footnote]]
> 
> //SCP-2758-A appears distressed.//
> 
> **16:27:57 | SCP-2758-A:** Alright.
> 
> **16:27:59 | Dr. Wickerford:** Can you elaborate on the specific method of your arrival?
> 
> **16:28:03 | SCP-2758-A:** Yeah, sorry. Because so much of what we write is detailed enough to pass as real scientific analysis and documentation, we -- that's me and Jimmy and Jane, my two friends that did this with me -- started figuring that there was no reason thaumaturgic symbols //couldn't// be effective in our world. I mean, had anyone ever tried? So we did. And we weren't taking it seriously, I don't think.
> 
> **16:28:28 | Dr. Wickerford:** How so?
> 
> **16:28:30 | SCP-2758-A:** We took the creation and meaning of the symbols seriously, but not the actual setup of what we were doing. We based our logic on Jimmy's personal philosophy. He thinks there are four elements to existence: your body, your mind, your spirit, and your soul. He thinks that your body is your physical self, your five senses and perception. Your mind is your personality and how you understand having a body and using it. Your spirit is your sixth sense, it's how you can feel the energy of living and dead things, how your gut can tell you if an action is wrong or right. And your soul is you, the sapience inhabiting the body, using the body like a tool to communicate with other sapient souls in bodies.
> 
> **16:28:59 | Dr. Wickerford:** This is an intriguing perspective. And is this philosophy personally significant to you?
> 
> **16:29:04 | SCP-2758-A:** Not really. I think it's reasonable enough, but I don't firmly believe any explanation of existence.
> 
> **16:29:10 | Dr. Wickerford:** I see. May I ask if you have achieved your goals in manifesting yourself here?
> 
> //SCP-2758-A observes the room.//
> 
> **16:29:19 | SCP-2758-A:** Can I read my SCP document? What's wrong with me other than not being able to exist outside of this room?
> 
> **16:29:25 | Dr. Wickerford:** I don't see a reason that you can't read it once it's complete. You appear to be physically non-anomalous other than in the circumstances of your limited corporeal existence. What is your most recent memory prior to manifestation?
> 
> **16:29:37 | SCP-2758-A:** Jimmy and Jane scraping the chalk to make that last symbol. I closed my eyes and clenched my teeth because my skin just started to feel really hot. That was when it hit me that I should have taken this more seriously. And then I was here. The time in-between felt instantaneous and long at the same time, like when you fall asleep without realizing and all of a sudden it's morning. You might have had dreams, but you can't remember, only feel the time they took missing from you.
> 
> **16:30:02 | Dr. Wickerford:** Okay. Thank you for this information, SCP-2758-A. We'll likely be conducting other interviews with other personnel in the near future.
> 
> //Researcher Wickerford closes her clipboard and stands.//
> 
> **16:30:05 | SCP-2758-A:** You're not going to require that I go away again, right? If I can't even walk out of this room, I don't pose any containment difficulty. I'll just-
> 
> **16:30:10 | Dr. Wickerford:** We're keeping you right here if that's what you prefer. Either option is a reasonable containment procedure.
> 
> **16:30:15 | SCP-2758-A:** Thank you. The time in-between is awful. Impossibly long but not memorable. But I know it happens, I can feel it, and it was horrible. It felt like a few years. I can't explain it.
> 
> **16:30:24 | Dr. Wickerford:** Noted. Do you have any further questions before I go get the ball rolling on making this room livable? Can I do anything else for you?
> 
> **16:31:00 | SCP-2758-A:** I guess not. Thank you, and I'm sorry.
> 
> **16:31:04 | Dr. Wickerford:** No apology is necessary.

//On 07/23/18, Dr. J. Wardings, Site-42 Multi-U Information Specialist, was assigned to SCP-2758-A in order to discern more details of the nature of its origin, as well as the process it and its peers used to manifest it in Room G14.//

> **BEGIN LOG**
> 
> //Dr. Wardings enters the room and seats himself at the table.//
> 
> **Dr. Wardings:** Good morning, SCP-2758-A. I'm Wardings. That's with a D, not an N. I'd like to apologize for the methods used by your previous interviewer; she is not from a department with expertise on your type of anomaly, and was only temporary coverage until I could be reassigned.
> 
> **SCP-2758-A:** She was fine.
> 
> **Dr. Wardings:** Okay, good to know. Now, would you please disclose your legal name?
> 
> **SCP-2758-A:** [SENSITIVE INFORMATION REMOVED]
> 
> **Dr. Wardings:** Okay, give me a second.
> 
> //Dr. Wardings is equipped with an information records laptop, and is transcribing this interview as well as searching for relevant information.//
> 
> **Dr. Wardings:** Yes, alright. Is your Social Security Number ███-██-████?
> 
> **SCP-2758-A:** Uh... I think so? The first three sound right. I never memorized mine, my mom did.
> 
> **Dr. Wardings:** Are you underage?
> 
> **SCP-2758-A:** No, I'm 18.
> 
> **Dr. Wardings:** Okay, thank you. And what was your Wikidot username?
> 
> **SCP-2758-A:** [SENSITIVE INFORMATION REMOVED]
> 
> **Dr. Wardings:** Alright, I'll let our agents know. Now, are you able to provide details on the nature of the thaumaturgic symbols your peers created in order to achieve this result?
> 
> **SCP-2758-A:** We scanned all the drawings when we invented them. They're on the flash drive.
> 
> **Dr. Wardings:** The flash drive? Is this the one you were holding in your hand when the process took place?
> 
> **SCP-2758-A:** Yes. You have it, right?
> 
> **Dr. Wardings:** No, we do not.
> 
> **SCP-2758-A:** I guess it went wherever my clothes went.
> 
> **Dr. Wardings:** Can you draw these symbols from memory?
> 
> **SCP-2758-A:** Most certainly not. It's very hard to remember what they look like. It's probably memetic.
> 
> **Dr. Wardings:** Not likely. If you cannot provide details on the symbols, may I ask what the purpose of the flash drive was?
> 
> **SCP-2758-A:** Information. We put everything on the wiki on it, even the low-rated stuff. Jimmy said that even though it's not part of the four elements of living -- like what I was telling Wickerford -- information is key. Without information, we don't have anything to input into our thoughts, anything to perceive with our senses, anything that makes us aware we exist. Without that flash drive, I would have just ended up stuck in the in-between forever, no reality defined for me to exist in.
> 
> **Dr. Wardings:** I see. And did you intentionally seek out this room in Site-42?
> 
> **SCP-2758-A:** 42? I was hoping I'd end up in 19. I haven't even heard of Site-42.
> 
> **Dr. Wardings:** Okay. What is crucial to understand is that your reality construct's fiction -- while offering many parallels in naming conventions and operations -- is in almost all cases not a concrete indication nor transcription of real Foundation activities. Whatever individual, project, SCP object, or otherwise that you were seeking out in 19 likely does not actually exist. Does this make sense?
> 
> **SCP-2758-A:** I mean, I'm going to believe whatever you tell me, I guess. You're the real deal, literally speaking.
> 
> **Dr. Wardings:** Understood. What was your specific intention when you and your peers created this anomaly?
> 
> **SCP-2758-A:** I don't know. It's like I told her.
> 
> //SCP-2758-A gestures to the door, presumably referring to Researcher Wickerford.//
> 
> **Dr. Wardings:** You had no reason at all? Not even just to see if you could?
> 
> //SCP-2758-A pauses for several seconds and looks at the floor.//
> 
> **SCP-2758-A:** Jesus, I guess I should suck it up. Okay. I just hate my life, alright? It was the same as any other dumb shit young and miserable people do. I hated my life, I saw an escape, I took it. I don't know how else to say it. I'm bored and depressed. I just graduated high school. I'm- Am I rambling?
> 
> **Dr. Wardings:** No.
> 
> **SCP-2758-A:** Okay, and- So that's my life, I don't have the drive to do shit and I just get lost in fiction. I'm not really good at anything, or at least I don't think I am. I'm decent at writing, I guess. I procrastinate on my real obligations, I don't socialize off the internet... I'm just exactly the stereotype of my generation, I guess. The future just sounded so //miserable.// Like I'm just supposed to go marry some woman and have kids and spend the rest of my life paying off college loans and some fucking mortgage, with an 800 credit score and no real impact made. What a fucking life, right? Money, money, money. I guess my mental health got bad enough that I thought bringing myself here was a better option than keeping on trying to live out there. And if it didn't work, well, it would've been just us embarrassing ourselves in private.
> 
> **Dr. Wardings:** And what did you consider this option to be? I don't believe you elaborated with Wickerford regarding what your expectations were, here.
> 
> **SCP-2758-A:** I thought I would replace the character I'd written for myself. Just some low-level researcher working in 19. I didn't want anything special, I just- I thought I'd just instantly gain awareness. As myself, maybe even without the memories of the other life. When Jimmy said he thought he knew how to make it work, I didn't question it.
> 
> **Dr. Wardings:** I see.
> 
> **SCP-2758-A:** I think I thought this was where I really belonged. That maybe the universe was giving me hints through fiction at how to get where I would be happy. That the site existing in my world was just a beacon for anyone who could figure out the puzzle and get through to your world. It felt like the most freeing thing I'd ever done right up until I could tell it was //working,// and then I was scared, and then it was too late, and now it's permanently too late.
> 
> //SCP-2758-A pauses.//
> 
> **SCP-2758-A:** I mean, it is too late, right? Even if you amnesticized me and put me back just like normal, you don't know of any way to reverse it, right?
> 
> **Dr. Wardings:** Our department has tried to reverse construct overlaps, trust me. Especially when a human anomaly is involved. Time and time again. Once you miss that initial point -- the point at which the first observer witnesses the anomaly -- the chance of being able to reidentify the foreign construct's Scranton signature //and// induce enough of a localized refraction to handle switching something corporeal back over becomes nearly impossible, and exponentially so as time progresses. Think of it like planets aligning; you have to do it within that window. Narrowly missing your trajectory is still missing it.
> 
> **SCP-2758-A:** But with the orbit analogy, does that mean in a certain amount of time we could have another chance? And then again after that, in a loop?
> 
> **Dr. Wardings:** I won't lie; we don't know. The issue with the concept is that we wouldn't know when the window is going to pass again, and we can't keep that sort of containment equipment running constantly when the issues at hand destroy the equipment. For whatever reason -- likely the iffy thaumaturgic knowledge of Jimmy, it seems -- your reality tries to pull you back if you leave this room. You're not quite dedicated to this reality. You're not fully here, but you're most certainly not there either, and this room appears to be the halfway point for you.

> **SCP-2758-A:** So I can either not exist at all, like in that awful in-between space, or exist solely in this room.
> 
> **Dr. Wardings:** It would appear so, yes. We attempted several times to remove you manually through the use of Scranton Reality Anchors and other such devices, but they're not able to differentiate between this reality and yours because they're too similar. Most crossover events are from entirely foreign realities -- foreign concepts, foreign locations, things very noticeably different from our construct's traits. Thus, the Scranton signature is vastly different, and devices can properly identify the reality to which they should be anchored. But in this case, if Scranton signatures were colors, ours is red and yours is blood orange, or ours is purple and yours is violet. The anchors can't tell the difference, and thus, they can't isolate you.
> 
> **SCP-2758-A:** Okay. I suppose that makes as much sense as anything I've read.
> 
> **Dr. Wardings:** Understood. And if at any point you would like to speak with another member of Multi-U, a representative of the Ethics Committee, or a task force agent assigned to your reality construct who may be more familiar with your background than I, please inform one of us.
> 
> **SCP-2758-A:** A task force agent?
> 
> **Dr. Wardings:** [SENSITIVE INFORMATION REMOVED] Your site account will have to be passed off as a sockpuppet of a banned user, for instance, lest your missing status be questioned.
> 
> //SCP-2758-A is visibly agitated.//
> 
> **SCP-2758-A:** Oh Jesus, please don't do that. That's the only reputation I have left. I mean, fuck, that's the only way I still exist, really. It's not like my parents will file a missing persons report when they just finished telling me I need to fuck off out of their house.
> 
> **Dr. Wardings:** Please, don't panic. I suspected you might be uncomfortable with that, and I've already proposed an alternative method for dissuading against other users trying what you and your friends tried.
> 
> **SCP-2758-A:** Oh. What?
> 
> **Dr. Wardings:** You will be informed if Information Security deems it acceptable. Now, if you don't have any questions for me, I'll be out of here to write this up.
> 
> **END LOG**

> //Notes: SCP-2758-A's legal name and SSN match those of a Level 2 junior researcher assigned to SCP-████ in Site-19. The researcher in question is 23 years old with the same birth date as SCP-2758-A: a difference of five years. Neither individual is to be made aware of this. -JW//
