**Item #:** SCP-2216

**Object Class:** Euclid

> **From:** T. Xyank [Xyank.T@Foundation.org], Director, Temporal Research Division
> **To:** O5-8 [███████@Foundation.org]
> **Subject:** SCP-2216 Documentation
> **Body:** █████, 
> 
> Forgive my contemporary for his failure to adequately document 2216. When he was transferred to temporal I thought more highly of him than perhaps he deserved and in doing so doomed his existence in our reality. The first pass taken at writing the documentation should have been more thoroughly vetted prior to its use as functional containment procedures and for that I bear full responsibility. I have personally authored the new containment procedures for 2216 and give my solemn promise that the fate of my former assistant will not befall another member of this division.

**Special Containment Procedures:** As the method of transmission utilized by SCP-2216-1 is not fully understood, Mobile Task Force Iota-7 ("Mavericks") should focus efforts on the identification and recovery of SCP-2216-2 instances. Five (5) instances of SCP-2216-2 are to be kept at Site-19/2216 in separate storage lockers equipped with a Faraday cage to prevent wireless transmission of SCP-2216-1. Additional instances of SCP-2216-2 are to be destroyed at the earliest opportunity by incineration or confined to a Faraday-equipped storage apparatus in cases where incineration is not immediately possible. Due to SCP-2216-1's anomalous effects, visual testing of SCP-2216-2 is to be carried out exclusively by D-Class personnel.

All MTF Iota-7 agents and level 4/2216 researchers are to wear one-way mirrored, 100% reflective eye protection when viewing any visual media or subjects who have viewed an instance of SCP-2216-2. In the event that eye protection is damaged or removed, affected personnel should be contained and monitored for signs consistent with SCP-2216-1 exposure.
 
Subjects who have viewed an instance of SCP-2216-2 are to be contained for at least ten (10) days in a windowless 5 meter by 5 meter humanoid containment cell and monitored for signs consistent with SCP-2216-1 exposure. Subjects must undergo Procedure 185-Bellerophon to determine conscious awareness of SCP-2216-1. Subjects are allowed reasonable requests with the exception of electronic devices. Containment cell lighting is to be maintained at two hundred fifty (250) lumens and monitored by CCTV equipment placed behind a one-way mirror. Subjects determined to be a vector for SCP-2216-3 events must be monitored until the completion of testing to forestall SCP-2216-3. All video monitoring equipment is to be destroyed immediately following testing and termination of SCP-2216-3p subjects.

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2216 documentation is stored in a secure research suite (SRS) at Site-19. Access to SCP-2216 documentation is restricted to the lead researcher assigned to SCP-2216. The lead researcher is forbidden access to video media or any device capable of displaying such enforced by two (2) armed security personnel at all times.

Foundation AI SlumberingHourglass monitors all connected visual media prior to playback for instances of SCP-2216-1. When detected, SlumberingHourglass will download a copy of the file to a secure server (Each retained as SCP-2216-2-XXXX), then corrupt and remove the affected files (see Addendum 2216-SH-23.4.5 for Technical Specifications). If SlumberingHourglass fails to remove an instance of SCP-2216-2 prior to viewing, or in cases of non-connected video media, Mobile Task Force Iota-7 ("Mavericks") will be dispatched to the viewing location and administer aerosolized class-C amnestics to all individuals within a one (1) mile radius of the viewing site via aerial saturation. Non-connected instances of SCP-2216-2 are to be kept within SCP-2216's SRS at Site-19.

Due to SCP-2216-1's anomalous effects, visual testing of SCP-2216-2 is to be carried out exclusively by D-Class personnel. Subjects who have viewed an instance of SCP-2216-2, either knowingly or unknowingly, are to be contained in a windowless 5 meter by 5 meter humanoid containment unit (HCU) monitored by a CCTV audio/visual apparatus. Subjects must be restrained in such a manner to prevent their direct line of sight to any visual monitoring equipment. Lighting within is to be maintained constantly at two hundred fifty (250) lumens.

**Description:** 

SCP-2216-1 is an entity or group of entities which presently exists in approximately ██% of video media. The entity uniformly appears in the background, to the side of the frame, or in other locations where its presence is generally not detected by the viewer. SCP-2216-1 will relocate itself upon viewing via the following methods of transmission:

* Wired or wireless networks
* Direct connection of digital storage devices
* Dual VCR Recordings
* [REDACTED]

SCP-2216-1 is assumed to possess other methods of transmission, being present in media under conditions in which the aforementioned criteria are unavailable. In approximately ██% of SCP-2216-1 transmissions, instances of the entity will be present on both the original medium and the copied medium.

SCP-2216-2 denotes the physical device which contains SCP-2216-1 instances. The first instance of SCP-2216-2 (SCP-2216-2-1) was discovered in the home of ██████ H███, a resident of ████████, New York on the 17th of August, 19██. See Document 2216-15C for further details regarding recovery. To date, ███ instances of SCP-2216-2 have been recovered. 

When a subject views video media containing SCP-2216-1 and becomes consciously aware of the entity, SCP-2216-1's anomalous effects will manifest. In approximately ██% of subjects, psychosis, parataxis, catatonia, and [REDACTED] will occur, followed by expiration of the subject within the next ██ to ██ hours. Post-mortem examinations have revealed severe damage to the synaptic pathways within the subject's posterior parietal cortex. Subjects who experience these symptoms are not considered to be a vector for SCP-2216-3 events.

SCP-2216-3 is a dual-phase phenomenon which occurs in ██% of subjects approximately █ to ██ hours after becoming consciously aware of SCP-2216-1. 

* During the primary phase, subjects determined to have consciously identified SCP-2216-1 and not succumb to its anomalous effects (hereafter SCP-2216-3p [Prime]) will report sighting movement, or a figure in their peripheral vision. Upon directing their line of sight toward the entity, SCP-2216-3p subjects uniformly report its disappearance. Subjects report entity appearing under visual conditions with an obstructed horizontal field of view, such as hallways longer than 10 meters connected in a perpendicular alignment to a space allowing transversal past the viewable width of the hallway, internal windows or doors less than 1 meter wide (provided the ambient luminosity in the area beyond is less than 50 lumens), and forested areas. Attempts to capture the entity via video monitoring during procedure 851-Bellerophon have failed. 

* The sighting of this entity will trigger the secondary phase during which SCP-2216-3p subjects will instantly vanish upon passing out of the direct line of either direct visual or indirect video surveillance. Tracking devices (including those placed inside the subject) cease to function at this point. Analysis of SCP-2216-3 events reveals carbonization in the immediate vicinity of the subject's location, suggesting a substantial and immediate discharge of energy. Testing of these areas have suggested the presence of [REDACTED] (See Addendum 2216-YKE104).  

**Testing Logs:** 

[[collapsible show="+ Test Log: TE-2216-08-1" hide="- Hide"]]

__**Test: TE-2216-08-1 - Date February 3rd, ████**__
> **Subject:** D-10199
> **Foreward:** SCP-2216-2-3 is a USB drive with one (1) MPEG-4 file present, depicting a mountain biking run, three (3) minutes, twenty seven (27) seconds in length, from the perspective of the biker's helmet camera. It has been determined that the video was transferred via bluetooth from an █████ cellular phone to a computer, then copied to the drive. Both the phone and computer were determined to be unaffected by SCP-2216-1 at time of recovery.
> **Procedure:** Subject D-10199 was placed in a secure testing chamber with one (1) folding metal chair, one (1) folding card table, and one (1) Hewlett Packard brand laptop computer. Wireless communication hardware was removed from the computer prior to the test. D-10199 was instructed to open the file and view it in its entirety, making note of any figures in the video which appeared abnormal or out of place.
> 
> **Results:** D-10199 did so with minimal objection and began to view SCP-2216-2-3. From 1:23 to 1:26, the subject in the video, D-10199 communicated the rider panned up from his handle bars and video revealed a humanoid figure walking through the desert brush, roughly forty (40) meters from the subject. Due to the distance from the figure, visual clarity was limited, but D-10199 made note of the figure's diminutive frame. D-10199 was instructed to cease playback and was escorted from the room.
> 
> Consistent with SCP-2216 procedures, D-10199 was confined to the appropriate HCU. After approximately 48 hours, D-10199 has displayed minimal symptoms consistent with exposure to SCP-2216-1. D-10199 has communicated to researchers mild feelings of fear and anxiety but otherwise seems unaffected by the viewing.
> 
> **Analysis:** D-10199's response has been inconsistent with established symptoms for subjects affected by SCP-2216-1. Dr. ████ has requested D-10199 be remitted for testing under procedure 851-Bellerophon as a possible vector for SCP-2216-3. Request granted by majority vote of the O5 council.

[[collapsible show="Procedure 851-Bellerophon" hide="-Hide"]]
**Procedure 851-Bellerophon:**

[[include component:image-block name=bellerophon.gif|caption=Secure Testing Site-109 - Blueprint (Not to scale)|width=300px]]

Secure Testing Site-109 is a 'T' shaped hallway with measurements of thirty five (35) meters from point "S" to point "CP", and twenty seven (27) meters from point "F1" to point "F2". Subjects are to be introduced at point "S" and monitored by disguised CCTV cameras located at point F1, F2 and S. Walls of hallway adjacent to point S are to be lined with decor of lead researcher's choosing, preferably photographs. Lights throughout Site-109 are to be reduced to 25 lumens with intermittent flicker effect. At no time during testing should luminosity rise above 50 lumens. Door at point S is to be opened and subject instructed to maintain position. After one (1) minute of no reported activity, subject is to be instructed to move forward to examine decor of hallway S, still reporting any movement. If subject reaches contact point CP without reporting movement they may be extracted from the testing site and re-admitted to containment. Subjects are to repeat this process at a rate of once every three (3) days, not lasting longer than ten (10) days in total. Subjects who report no movement during testing period are to be considered SCP-2216-3 negative, administered Class-C amnestics and released.

__**Test: TE-2216-08-2 - Date February 6th, ████**__
> **Subject:** D-10199
> **Procedure:** See Procedure 851-Bellerophon 
> 
> **Results:** D-10199 entered Secure Testing Site-109 at point S. The following is the recorded transcript:
> 
> **<Begin Log, [00:00:00]>**
> 
> **00:00:02:** D-10199 enters hallway from point S. CCTV monitoring reports normal from point S, F1 and F2.
> 
> **Lead researcher, Dr. L███ [00:00:12]:**D-10199, Please remain where you are until you are instructed otherwise. Report any signs of movement.
> 
> **00:00:14:** D-10199 does as instructed
> 
> **00:00:54:** D-10199 has not reported any activity for nearly one (1) minute.
> 
> **Lead researcher, Dr. L███ [00:00:59]:** D-10199, Please take note of the pictures on the walls beside you. You may proceed down the hallway but please examine each one carefully. 
> 
> **00:01:27:** D-10199 continues down the hallway often crossing sides to carefully examine each picture. At roughly 8 meters from point S, D-10199 quickly makes a start toward point CP.
> 
> **D-10199 [00:01:28]:** What the [Expletive] was that? What the [Expletive] is in here with me?
> 
> **00:01:30:** D-10199 continues to focus on point CP. CCTV at points F1 and F2 show no abnormal behavior.
> 
> **Lead researcher, Dr. L███ [00:01:36]:** Our cameras show nothing is in there with you. Please continue to examine the pictures. Remember your release is contingent on your cooperation during these exercises.
> 
> **00:01:50:** D-10199 reluctantly returns to the pictures on his right.
> 
> **D-10199 [00:02:08]:** There it is again! There's something in here! [At this point D-10199 appears distressed and proceeds down the hallway at a walking pace]
> 
> **Lead researcher, Dr. L███ [00:02:10]:** D-10199, stop! There is nothing in the testing site with you. Please return to the pictures immediately!
> 
> **00:02:15:** D-10199 continues down the hallway, ignoring the commands of Dr. L███. Dr. L███ gives the orders to raise lighting in the chamber to 250 lumens and dispatch security elements to detain D-10199. Concurrently, cameras at point S, F1 and F2 fail for approximately fourteen (14) seconds.
> 
> **00:02:32:** D-10199 is not visibly present on cameras at point S, F1 or F2. Security elements report the subject is absent from the chamber.
>  
> **<End Log, [00:02:45]>**
> 
> **Closing Statement:** Analysis of camera S video footage by SlumberingHourglass shows movement at point CP at 00:01:10, seventeen (17) seconds before D-10199 reported any anomalous movement. Research is ongoing to determine whether this movement was a control failure during the test. SlumberingHourglass was unable to recover any footage during the 14 second outage but retained the footage as a possible SCP-2216-2 instance. Upon inspection of Site-109, carbon scoring was found present at D-10199's last known position.

> **Note from Maria Jones, Director, RAISA:** Due to the inherent danger of cross testing SCP's, the O5 has all but banned the practice. However, in rare cases such as this, where an SCP plainly makes reference to another, O5-█ has authorized the lead researcher for SCP-2216, cross-SCP access for SCP-1999 files. Your ability to read this message is evidence of memetic controls for access to both SCP files. If you are not the lead researcher for SCP-2216, please close this window and report to Site Director ███████ for amnestic treatment. Violation of this protocol is grounds for immediate termination in accordance with protocol 168-Abeloth.
