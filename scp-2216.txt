**Special Containment Procedures:** As the method of transmission utilized by SCP-2216-1 is not fully understood, Mobile Task Force Iota-7 ("Mavericks") should focus efforts on the identification and recovery of SCP-2216-2 instances. Five (5) instances of SCP-2216-2 are to be kept at Site-19/2216 in separate storage lockers equipped with a Faraday cage to prevent wireless transmission of SCP-2216-1. Additional instances of SCP-2216-2 are to destroyed at the earliest opportunity by incineration. In cases where incineration is not immediately possible, SCP-2216-2 instances should be confined to a Faraday-equipped storage apparatus in order to prevent wireless transmission of SCP-2216-1. Due to SCP-2216-1's anomalous effects, visual testing of SCP-2216-2 is to be carried out exclusively by D-Class personnel.

All MTF Iota-7 agents and level 4/2216 researchers are to wear one-way mirrored, 100% reflective eye protection when viewing any visual media or subjects who have viewed an instance of SCP-2216-2. In the event that eye protection is damaged or removed, affected personnel should be contained and monitored for signs consistent with SCP-2216-1 exposure.
 
Any civilians who have viewed an instance of SCP-2216-2 are to be detained as a possible vector for SCP-2216-3. Subjects are to be housed in a windowless 5 meter by 5 meter humanoid containment cell and monitored for signs consistent with SCP-2216-1 exposure. Subjects are allowed all reasonable requests with the exception of electronic devices. At all times, containment cell lighting is not to fall below two hundred fifty (250) lumens and monitored by CCTV equipment placed behind a one-way mirror. Subjects posing a risk of SCP-2216-3 events must be monitored until the completion of testing to forestall SCP-2216-3. All video monitoring equipment is to be destroyed immediately following testing and termination of SCP-2216-3p subjects.

**Description:** 

> **Note from O5-█:** Due to the nature of the infohazard contained herein, access of this document is restricted to three (3) researchers with assigned security clearance 4/2216. Upon submission of credentials, personnel are to be contained to Site-19/2216. Beyond this point, interaction with outside personnel is strictly prohibited. All interaction with O5 is to be conducted strictly through audio channels. Researchers will be briefed at the time of their assignment to SCP-2216 concerning the identity of their peers with staff rotations to occur on a monthly basis. Researchers who have completed work with SCP-2216 are to be debriefed and administered Class-C amnesiacs before leaving the premises of Site-19/2216. Should any personnel inform you they have been granted level 4/2216 clearance, please report them to O5-█ immediately.

[[collapsible show="REDACTED BY ORDERS OF O5-█. Enter Credentials: Security Clearance Level 4/2216" hide="-Credentials Accepted"]]SCP-2216-1 is an entity or group of entities which presently exists in approximately ██% of recorded video media. SCP-2216-1 will generally appear in the background of videos as an obscure, humanoid figure wearing generally inconspicuous clothing. In all cases where SCP-2216-1 has been observed, the video angle or attire will obscure any identifying features. Because of SCP-2216-1's mundane appearance it is often unnoticed upon initial viewings.

SCP-2216-1 has demonstrated the ability to transmit through wired or wireless networks, transfer of digital storage devices, and in a manner not currently understood, using the human cranial nerve II through way of the retina as the point of transmission and reception. SCP-2216-1 is assumed to possess other methods of transmission, being present in media under conditions in which the aforementioned criterion are unavailable. In approximately ██% of SCP-2216-1 transmissions, instances of the entity will be present on both the original medium and the copied medium. See Addendum 2216-YKE104 for further information.

SCP-2216-2 denotes instances of video medium in which SCP-2216-1 is present. The five (5) instances of SCP-2216-2 (hereafter SCP-2216-2-1 through SCP-2216-2-5) currently in foundation archives, exist on varying media devices including VHS tapes, DVDs, Blu-ray discs and USB drives (flash memory) for testing. See Test Log 2216-TL1 for supplemental information.

* SCP-2216-2-1 - A DVD labeled '██████'. Video appears to be a 12 minute home movie taking place in a wooded area. Refer to document 2216-11A for transcript of the video. At this time, research is ongoing to determine any connection between SCP-2216-2-1, SCP-████ and [REDACTED].
* SCP-2216-2-2 - A home movie DVD of the ██th birthday of [REDACTED], a citizen of ████████, California, approximately 44 minutes in length. Agents have determined that [REDACTED] is not affected by SCP-2216-1, and interviews with those present at the time of recording have no recollection of the entity's presence.
* SCP-2216-2-3 - A USB drive with one (1) MPEG-4 file present of a mountain biking run, three (3) minutes, twenty seven (27) seconds in length, from the perspective of the biker's helmet camera. It has been determined that the video was transferred via bluetooth from an █████ cellular phone to a computer, then copied to the drive.
* SCP-2216-2-4 - A Blu-ray factory copy of the movie [REDACTED] produced by 20th Century Fox Entertainment. As of ██-██-████, SCP-2216-1 has only been confirmed present in one copy of the movie. There have been no anomalous instances from theater viewings.
* SCP-2216-2-5 -  A VHS copy of [REDACTED], produced by ████ ██████ Studios. Testing revealed that the VHS in question had been produced by a dual VCR recording system. The original copy was not present at time of recovery. Interestingly, SCP-2216-1 appears in the animated format of the film as opposed to it's "live-action" form in other media.

The first instance of SCP-2216-2 (SCP-2216-2-1) was discovered in the home of ██████ H███, a resident of ████████, New York on the 17th of August, 19██. Mr. H███ was apprehended by local authorities after security footage from the Musée d'Art Moderne (Trans: Museum of Modern Art) located in ████████, New York confirmed him as the perpetrator of an ongoing minor theft case filed by a Mr. ██████ D██████, a local artist and patron of the museum. At present it is believed that Mr. H███ was [REDACTED] when the theft occurred. Embedded agents recovered the DVD in accordance with SCP-████ containment procedures, but remained unaware of its anomalous properties until it was viewed by Dr. ██████, who displayed symptoms consistent with SCP-2216-1 exposure. Due to the time frame for the onset of these symptoms, SCP-2216-2-1 was classified as an anomalous object by foundation agents (effective ██/██/19██). Upon discovery of additional SCP-2216-2 instances, the DVD was reclassified as SCP-2216-2-1 (effective  ██/██/19██).

Subjects who have viewed an instance of SCP-2216-2 should be monitored for at least ten (10) days and undergo Procedure 185-Bellerophon to determine conscious awareness of SCP-2216-1 (and thus, status as a vector for SCP-2216-3 events). In a manner not yet understood, SCP-2216-1 seems to utilize the posterior parietal cortex as a medium of storage in subjects who have conscious awareness of it. ██% of subjects will experience psychosis, parataxis, catatonia, and [REDACTED]. In 100% of cases, expiration attributed to synaptic damage in the medulla oblongata or [REDACTED] will occur within the next ██ to ██ hours. Subjects experience these symptoms and those who are not consciously aware the entity are not susceptible SCP-2216-3 events. See addendum 2216-T2 for an approximate timetable for the manifestation of SCP-2216-3 events.

SCP-2216-3 is a phenomenon which occurs in ██% of subjects approximately █ to ██ hours after becoming consciously aware of SCP-2216-1. During SCP-2216-3 events, subjects (hereafter SCP-2216-3p [Prime]) will report sighting SCP-2216-1 in their peripheral vision. SCP-2216-1 will present itself as a semi-corporeal and seemingly impermanent figure with the capability to move through solid matter and vanish from assumed locations after passing out of a subject's line of sight. Subjects have reported SCP-2216-1 to manifest in the following contexts:

* In 70% of cases, SCP-2216-1 will manifest in hallways longer than 20 meters, but no wider than 4 meters with 'T' intersections at end opposite SCP-2216-3p. SCP-2216-3p subjects report the entity moving across the visual width of the hallway quickly enough to avoid accurate identification. Attempts to capture the entity via video monitoring in controlled tests have been met with mixed results. See Incident Log 2216-IL2.23 for further information.
* In cases where subjects have not entered a suitable hallway, SCP-2216-1 will appear in any context where the width of the visual field is narrow enough to limit visual identification. It has been observed to move past internal windows no wider than 1 meter (provided the ambient luminosity in the area beyond is less than 50 lumens), partially open doors and in any area with an obstructed horizontal field of view. Subjects report SCP-2216-1 will maintain a minimum distance of approximately seven (7) meters while in direct visual field; It has been reported to move closer when subjects have sighted it "out of the corner of [their] eye." Due to the contexts in which SCP-2216-1 will manifest, visual accounts are vague and inconsistent.

SCP-2216-3p subjects who have sighted SCP-2216-1 outside of visual media will instantly vanish upon passing out of the direct line of either direct visual or indirect video surveillance. Tracking devices (including those placed inside the subject) cease to function at this point. In cases of indirect observation, video feeds are not required to be actively monitored by personnel as the presence of monitoring equipment has proven effective in forestalling SCP-2216-3 events. 

Analysis of SCP-2216-3 events reveals carbonization in the immediate vicinity of the subject's location, suggesting a substantial and immediate discharge of energy. Testing of these areas have suggested the presence of particle/anti-particle interactions most commonly associated with [REDACTED].  

[[include component:image-block name=amarod02.gif|caption=Secure Testing Site-109 - Blueprint (Not to scale)|width=300px]]

**Procedure 851-Bellerophon:** Secure Testing Site-109 is a 'T' shaped hallway with measurements of thirty three (33) meters from point "S" to point "CP", and forty seven (47) meters from point "F1" to point "F2". Subjects are to be introduced at point "S" and monitored at all times by CCTV cameras located at point F1, F2 and S. Walls of hallway adjacents to point S are to be lined with decor of lead researcher's choosing, preferably photographs. Lights throughout Site-109 are to be reduced to 25 lumens with intermittent flicker effect. At no time during testing should luminosity rise above 50 lumens. Door at point S is to be opened and subject instructed to maintain position and report any movement. After one (1) minute of no reported activity, subject is to be instructed to move forward to examine decor of hallway S, still reporting any movement. If subject reaches contact point CP without reporting movement they may be extracted from the testing site and re-admitted to containment. Subjects are to repeat this process at a rate of once every three (3) days, not lasting longer than ten (10) days in total. Subjects who report no movement during testing period are to be considered SCP-2216-3 negative, administered Class-C amnesiacs and released.

**Addendum 2216-YKE104:** 
> -From the office of T. Xyank, Lead Temporal Researcher,
> 
> Contrary to the claims made by SCP-2216-3p subjects, analysis of the area in which SCP-2216-3 events have occurred reveals carbon scoring around the footprints of the subject, indicating a substantial and immediate discharge of energy. Testing conducted in these areas suggests the presence of particle/anti-particle interactions most commonly found during FK-Class Temporal Misalignments. If our theory is correct, the entity that subjects assume to be SCP-2216-1 is actually a temporally displaced version of themselves (Classification as SCP-2216-3d [Displaced] pending). Due to the quantity of particle/anti-particle pairs, researchers project SCP-2216-3 events to irreversibly damage the quantum fabric which comprises our reality by the year 19██, spiraling us toward a YK-Class Reality Restructuring Event by the year 20██. To counteract the threat posed by SCP-2216-3 events, termination is required in all cases of SCP-2216-3p subjects following the completion of testing. SCP-2216-3 events, combined with the proliferation of video media in the past two decades, makes a passive approach to containment implausible.

**Addendum 2216-T2:** The following is an approximate timetable for SCP-2216-3 events.
> **[+00:00 hours]:** Subject visually confirms SCP-2216-1 within SCP-2216-2 instance.
> 
> **[+00:01-01:00 hours]:** Subjects display increased signs of fear, nausea, and neuroticism. Subjects will often respond aggressively to sudden stimuli.
> 
> **[+01:01-04:00 hours]:** Previous signs will reduce slightly during this period although subjects will generally still appear restless. Approximately four (4) hours after initial viewing marks the earliest occurrence of an SCP-2216-3 event to date.
> 
> **[+04:01-10:00 hours]:** Subjects who do not experience SCP-2216-3 events during this period will slowly begin to feel the nauseating effects fade. Approximately concurrent with the final minute feelings of nausea, subjects will demonstrate and apparent lack of fear. Subjects often express a desire to change locations and if allowed will attempt to enter areas  in which SCP-2216-1 commonly appears. Subjects who are contained to their current location will demonstrate a marked increase in neuroticism and aggressiveness.
> 
> **[+10:01 hours]:** Subjects will demonstrate a marked decline in neuroticism, but remain restless. This behavior will persist indefinitely until the subject either undergoes an SCP-2216-3 event or is terminated. To date, the longest recorded persistence of symtpoms recorded has been ██ days (subject was terminated at this point to prevent SCP-2216-3 event from occurring). Upper limits on the duration of these symptoms has yet to be determined.

__**Test:  - Date: ███████ ██th, ████**__
> **Subject:** D-█████
> **Procedure:** Subject D-█████ was placed in secure testing chamber with one (1) 32" flat screen television manufactured by ███████, one (1) VCR manufactured by █████████, one (1) DVD player manufactured by ████, one (1) Blu-ray player manufactured by ████, one (1) USB connection, capable of MPEG-4 playback and SCP-2216-2-1. All devices were connected to the television and checked for playback using non-anomalous media. One (1) closed circuit camera was placed over the door of the chamber with its lens obscured by an appropriate mirror. D-█████ was seated facing the door and television to avoid potential transmission vectors. D-█████ was informed to make note of any figures in the film which appeared abnormal or out of place in the video, insert SCP-2216-2-1 into the VCR, and begin playback.

__**Test: TE-2216-2-3 - Date February 3rd, ████**__
> **Subject:** D-10199
> **Procedure:** Subject D-10199 was placed in a secure testing chamber identical to the one utilized in TE-2216-2-1. D-10199 was informed to make note of any figures in the film which appeared abnormal or out of place in the video, connect SCP-2216-2-3 to the appropriate port and begin playback.
> 
> **Results:** D-10199 did so with minimal objection and began to view SCP-2216-2-3. From 1:23 to 1:26, the subject in the video, D-10199 communicated the rider panned up from his handle bars and video revealed a humanoid figure walking through the desert brush, roughly forty (40) meters from the subject. Due to the distance from the figure, visual clarity was limited, but D-10199 made note of similar disproportionate qualities of the figure to the previous test. D-11568 was instructed to cease playback and was escorted from the room.
> 
> As of [REDACTED], D-10199 has maintained normal behavior (approximately ██ days) and displays minimal symptoms consistent with exposure to SCP-2216-2. D-10199 has communicated to researchers mild feelings of fear and anxiety but otherwise seems unaffected by the viewing.
> 
> **Analysis:** D-10199's response has been wildly inconsistent with established behavior for subjects affected by SCP-2216-2. Dr. ████ has requested a full psychological panel be conducted for D-10199 and monthly termination be delayed until the cause of this response can be determined. D-10199 will be kept under constant video surveillance and referred to phase 2 testing following psychological panel.

__**Test: TE-2216-2-5 - Date: February 20th, ████**__
> **Subject:** D-19856
> **Procedure:** Subject D-19856 was placed in a secure testing chamber identical to the one utilized in TE-2216-2-1. D-19856 was informed to make note of any figures in the film which appeared abnormal or out of place in the video, insert SCP-2216-2-5 into the DVD player, and begin playback.
> 
> **Results:** D-19856 did so without objection and began to view SCP-2216-2-5. Roughly four (4) minutes into the film D-19856 communicated that he noticed an obscure figure in the background of the marketplace through which the palace guards were chasing [DATA EXPUNGED]. It was noted at this time that the figure took an animated appearance consistent with the film. D-19856 was instructed to eject the VHS and was escorted from the room.
> 
> D-19856 maintained normal behavior for approximately █ hours. By █ hours subject began to exhibit symptoms consistent with exposure including hallucinations, parataxis and [REDACTED]. After approximately ██ hours, subject had attempted escape fourteen (14) times. Agents entered containment in an attempt to calm D-19856, however subject pleaded with agent █████ to kill him. Refusal of this request prompted the subject to lunge at agent ███████ in an attempt to [REDACTED]. Subject was killed by agent █████ as an act of self defense. Agent ███████ suffered minor lacerations as a result of the incident.
> 
> **Analysis:** It would appear that effects of SCP-2216-1 manifest more quickly than events occurring outside containment. Whether this is coincidental or due to other factors is unknown at this time. Additional testing will be conducted to determine the context in which SCP-2216-1 appears for the remaining instances of SCP-2216-2, and to search for a pattern to their appearances.

__**Test: TE-2216-3-10199 - Date February 6th, ████**__
> **Subject:** D-10199
> **Procedure:** See Procedure 851-Bellerophon 
> 
> **Results:** D-10199 entered Secure Testing Site-109 at point S. The following is the recorded transcript:
> 
> **<Begin Log, [00:00:00]>**
> 
> **00:00:02:** D-10199 enters hallway from point S. CCTV monitoring reports normal from point S, F1 and F2.
> 
> **Lead researcher, Dr. L███ [00:00:37]:**D-10199, Please proceed slowly down the hallway until you are instructed to stop.
> 
> **00:00:41:** D-10199 does as instructed
> 
> **Lead researcher, Dr. L███ [00:00:44]:** Stop.
> 
> **00:00:45:** D-10199 does as instructed. At this point D-10199 is roughly three (3) meters from point S
> 
> **Lead researcher, Dr. L███ [00:00:59]:** D-10199, Please take note of the pictures on the walls beside you. You may proceed down the hallway but please examine each one carefully. 
> 
> **00:01:27:** D-10199 continues down the hallway often crossing sides to carefully examine each picture. At roughly 8 meters from point S, D-10199 quickly makes a start toward point CP.
> 
> **D-10199 [00:01:28]:** What the [Expletive] was that? What the [Expletive] is in here with me?
> 
> **00:01:30:** D-10199 continues to focus on point CP. CCTV at points F1 and F2 show no abnormal behavior.
> 
> **Lead researcher, Dr. L███ [00:01:36]:** Our cameras show nothing is in there with you. Please continue to examine the pictures. Remember your release is contingent on your cooperation during these exercises.
> 
> **00:01:50:** D-10199 reluctantly returns to the pictures on his right.
> 
> **D-10199 [00:02:08]:** There it is again! There's something in here! [At this point D-10199 appears distressed and proceeds down the hallway at a walking pace]
> 
> **Lead researcher, Dr. L███ [00:02:10]:** D-10199, stop! There is nothing in the testing site with you. Please return to the pictures immediately!
> 
> **00:02:15:** D-10199 continues down the hallway, ignoring the commands of Dr. L███. Doctor gives the orders to raise lighting in the chamber to 250 lumens and dispatch security elements to detain D-10199. Concurrently, cameras at point S, F1 and F2 fail for approximately fourteen (14) seconds.
> 
> **00:02:32:** D-10199 is not visibly present on cameras at point S, F1 or F2. Security elements report the subject is absent from the chamber.
>  
> **<End Log, [00:02:45]>**
> 
> **Closing Statement:** Analysis of camera S video footage shows movement at point CP at 00:01:10, seventeen (17) seconds before D-10199 reported any anomalous movement. Due to the recording angle and the presence of D-10199, no visual identification is possible to determine the source of the movement. Upon inspection of Site-109, carbon scoring was found present at D-10199's last known position. Video forensics managed to recover the following image from camera F2 at approximately 00:02:22.
