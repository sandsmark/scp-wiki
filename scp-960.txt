[[/div]]

**Item #:** SCP-960

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-960 must be kept in a 10 cm-thick seamless, steel cubic container measuring 50 cm x 50cm x 60cm. Those conducting research upon it are to be the only ones given the codes that unlock its room and its container. Any handling of SCP-960 is to be conducted while the researcher is wearing gloves (except when it is being tested upon D-class or other subjects).

Until he/she has created nine original works, any human who comes into contact with SCP-960 via the skin is to be kept in an isolation ward and provided with whatever supplies they ask for, given that these items are cleared for their use by appropriate officials. After the ninth opus and subsequent loss of scientific knowledge, however, the subject is to be neutralized immediately.

**Description:** SCP-960 is a sizable fragment of what is speculated to be an ancient Greek vase, discovered by on the island of ████, near the site of the ancient Minoan city of ███████. On its surface are depicted three of the nine Muses; the two identifiable ones are Melpomene, in the middle, and Clio, on the left. The one on the right, shown as holding a dagger to her own neck, has never been seen in any other piece of Greco-Roman art and cannot be identified as appearing in any recorded myth.

A short but variable time after a human touches SCP-960, the subject will be struck at ever-shorter intervals by a series of original ideas. The natures of these inspirations always follow a strict progression:
# A piece of music (usually classical; occasionally, a fully-formed opera)
# An intricate choreography
# A painting, drawing, or sculpture
# A profound psychological or sociological insight
# A work of fiction of variable length, or a moving and detailed (and completely true) autobiography
# A spiritual revelation
# A work of drama
# One singular joke (which the subject typically repeats as often as conversations allow)
# A scientific breakthrough, often pertaining to [DATA EXPUNGED]

Subjects exposed to SCP-960 will invariably request the materials they need to complete these works; if they do not receive them, they will become belligerent and uncooperative until their requests are satisfied.

It is worth noting that the ideas are never written down in any sort of rough copy; they only ever appear as the final product, as if a full-fledged idea had entered the subject's head and left it unchanged.

Subjects also display extraordinary talent in each of the fields listed above, but only for as long as they are working on completing their tasks. Afterward, all knowledge of the listed subjects seems to vanish from their memory, even if they were trained in the disciplines before.

After the aforementioned itinerary is exhausted, the inspirations become more sinister. All creative energy previously spent on the arts and sciences is focused on devising ingenious methods of violence. Instead of asking for materials at this stage, the subject will begin to seek them out proactively. Records pertaining to the stages of exposure are detailed in the Addenda.

**Addendum 960-01:**
* //Incident 01, est. date 20/07/████//
 * SCP-960 found by amateur archaeologist ██████ ██████████, south of the city of [DATA EXPUNGED]; it is unknown exactly when he first touched the artifact, but family later reported that he began to ask them for a series of artistic and scientific supplies, despite his previous lack of interest in either field. Created by Mr. ██████████ were the following:
  * A symphony, entitled "██████████ ███", written for a full orchestra and an extensive percussion section.
  * A complex ballet, set to the previously mentioned symphony, containing one of the most intricate //pas de deux// ever choreographed.
  * A triptych depicting strikingly detailed images of what would appear to be the ███ ██████.
  * An unprecedented corollary to Albert Bandura's theory of observational learning.
  * An account of his own life, starting from his own birth and culminating with the events of the previous year.
  * A rebuttal of Nikolai Berdyaev's 1952 essay //The Truth of Orthodoxy.//
  * A set of three one-act plays centered around the theme of alienation in a society dedicated to individual achievement, entitled (in Greek): ██ ███████, ████, and █████ █ ██.
  * [DATA EXPUNGED]. This is the type of joke not meant to be told in polite company.
  * A truly four-dimensional model of an octachoron. //("This is the most worrying thing to me- much, much more so than the murders. Somehow, this thing gave him the ability to- even if just for a moment- reach into another spatial dimension. This in mind, I wouldn't be the least bit fazed about labeling the shard as Keter-class." -Dr. ████)//
  One week after this last accomplishment, by the family's reckoning, the ██████████' next-door neighbor died in a fire at her home. The [DATA EXPUNGED] Fire Department issued a report naming the source of the blaze to be a cain of hairspray fitted internally with a complicated mechanism similar to a pilot light on a stove. After local authorities learned that Mr. ██████████ had disappeared without warning just prior to his neighbor's death, the archaeologist was brought in for questioning. He, however, escaped the police by impaling [DATA EXPUNGED] corner. He then fled the police station on foot; however, Agent ████, who had heard reports of a murderer with abnormal strength on the run, captured the man and, when it became clear that no alternative solution presented itself, terminated Mr. ██████████.

**Addendum 960-02**
* //Incident 02, 03/02/████//
 * The curator of the [DATA EXPUNGED] Museum of Art in ████, ██, United States, having recently acquired SCP-960 and placed it in storage, decided to put it on display. Security footage shows the curator, Dr. ██████ ███, moving the artifact from the basement to a display case on the second floor, without wearing anything on his hands. As a result of this type of apathy towards museum property, he was put on probation by the board of advisors. He spent the next several weeks in his home, during which time he brought about:
  * A rock opera chronicling the rise and fall of the Roman emperor Octavian, left untitled.
  * An emotive modern dance routine involving two male dancers and a trapdoor.
  * A sculpture of himself sculpting Michaelangelo creating the Pietà. Described by examiners as "intriguingly ironic."
  * What would later be known as ███'s Theory of Egocentrism.
  * A science-fiction novella about humankind being unknowingly forced into a hopeless battle against extraterrestrial forces by a godlike ancestral species.
  * An outline for the polity and doctrine of an entirely new branch of Protestant Christianity, which he named ██████. //(Dr. ████ wishes it to be known that the ideology expressed within these documents, while indeed original, is tremendously vitriolic. It is possible that the violent aspects of SCP-960 crept in and mingled with the others- future research should be conducted to verify whether this is possible.)//
  * A five-act historical drama about the early stages of the American Revolutionary War; places emphasis upon onstage violence.
  * A "lightbulb joke"; researchers with particular political leanings have deemed it unfunny.
  * The enumeration of the precise nature of dark matter; papers are awaiting testing by means of [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-645 SCP-645] to determine their veracity.
After an undetermined length of time had passed since this last dissertation, Dr. ███ was caught by state law enforcement as he was plotting a way to free the inmates of a nearby maximum-security prison. When Dr. ███ refused to surrender and attempted to harm one of the officers, he was killed at the scene.
