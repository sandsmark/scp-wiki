> The Foundation is a global, clandestine organization with an iron grip on all media, literature, and public knowledge. They operate within a strict hierarchy of Researcher to Site Director to Overseer to ensure that humanity remains in perpetual and blissful ignorance. They will and have contained God, and no one seems to care.
> 
> **Everything is as it must be.**

> Site-17 is the second-largest Foundation containment facility, housing hundreds of researchers and containing twice as many anomalies. Corruption has slowly festered within its ranks. The embodiment of the anomalous is knocking on reality's door. Someone has stopped to listen to a humanoid's sobbing.
> 
> **Is everything as it must be?**

> Site-17 is on the brink. There is always the slowly-beating thrum of anticipation, always the knowledge of something bigger, always the end just out of reach. So keep your head down, and your nose to the grindstone. You don't have to like what we do here; you just have to do it. If you start having dreams, consult a psychiatrist. If you start feeling ill, look past the blood. If you start losing your memories, don't bother. That's just how it is in this place.

> **Nothing is as it should be.**

**Series Details**

[[tabview]]
[[tab That Which Can Be Said]]
++* Beginnings
[[div style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px"]]
The first tenet of Site-17's fiction is that the Foundation is, at its core, evil. It is a hierarchical, bureaucratic institution which seeks to enforce ignorance as law and is plainly hostile to the world at large. It worships the greater ethical good but has no method of defining what that good is.

Perhaps, the researchers within the Foundation have not realized this. Perhaps even the Overseers are likewise deluded. But the ones who have been trampled beneath the weight of the Foundation's transgressions are not so blind.
[[/div]]
++* Middles
[[div style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px"]]
The second tenet is that Site-17's fiction is a prelude to happiness. The world may be under the Foundation's thumb, but goodness persists regardless. Characters live, they love, they care for one another. Old structures are groaning beneath their antiquity, and giants are in motion on the dim horizon.

Wherever there is a shadow, there is light. Site-17 is only an examination of its world's temporary darkness.
[[/div]]
++* Continuations
[[div style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px"]]
Preferably, articles written for Site-17 should incorporate one or more of the following elements into their fiction:

* Inclusion of, or references to, established characters within the Site-17 lore
* Ethics Committee interactions
* Humanoid anomalies
* Essophysics
* Thematic interest in secrecy, truth, and/or the sacrifices made to maintain the Veil

In any case, feel free to parent your article to this page and add it to this page when it's posted!

[[tab That Which Can Be Known]]
[[f>toc]]
++ Essophysics
[[div style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px"]]
Essophysics is the study of embodiments. It is the discovery of everyday gods — usually hidden, always watching. Reality bends to their will, but they are all flawed. None know the heights and depths of human experience, none are all-powerful, all are subject to the discordancy of conceptualization. All are mortal. Painfully, obviously mortal.

|| Death, Ethan Horowitz || Universal decay of living organisms and societal structures, entropy. || [[[SCP-4260]]] ||
[[/collapsible]]
[[/div]]

++ AMEC and DRO
[[div style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px"]]
The Anti-Memetic Entities Catalog (AMEC) operates as a classified twin to the standard SCiPNET database, using specialized memetic inoculation to bypass the antimemetic effects of certain anomalous objects. These objects were given an Item Number of DRO-####, standing for Documentation-Resistant Object.
