**Item #:** SCP-5056

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5056 is the responsibility of the Hiring and Regulation Section of Site-43. Its position depends upon, is determined by, and may be directed via the work schedule of Philip Eugene Deering, Janitorial and Maintenance Section (JM64/SCP-5056-B).

SCP-5056-B is confined to Site-43. He must not be assigned tasks in the research or experimentation laboratories, operating theatres, administrative offices, containment facilities or wetworks of Site-43. He must nevertheless be assigned a daily duty schedule.

SCP-5056-B is not to be appraised of his SCP status.

SCP-5056-A and B are not to be separated. In the event of SCP-5056-B's death, selected staff will execute SARGENT Protocol to neutralize SCP-5056-A. SARGENT Protocol documents have been forwarded to suitable personnel; personnel who have not received SARGENT documents have no additional containment duties in relation to SCP-5056.

||~ 43NET Standing Orders [FILTERED: SCP-5056]||
|| **Standing Order 5056-01:** A network of wall-mounted mirrors, each in visual range of at least two others and all inspected on a regular schedule, must be maintained within each sector of Site-43.||
|| **Standing Order 5056-02:** No personnel requiring personal ocular devices may be admitted to Site-43.||
|| **Standing Order 5056-03:** Reflective materials must not be imported to or exported from Site-43.||

**Description:** SCP-5056 is two entangled objects, SCP-5056-A (sentient audiovisual phenomenon) and SCP-5056-B (Technician JM64, Philip E. Deering). The nature of this entanglement is ambiguous, hence Deering's SCP classification;  properly utilized, he is the only known method of containing SCP-5056-A.

SCP-5056-A is a hairless humanoid figure approximately two metres in height (precise measurement is complicated by the environments in which the subject manifests) with matte grey skin and ragged facial scars approximating two eyes and a mouth. These scars distend when SCP-5056-A observes its environment or "speaks."

SCP-5056-B is a Caucasian male, 172 centimetres tall with brown eyes and thinning, greying brown hair.

> And clearly non-anomalous. Deering's SCP classification is unwarranted, and further experimentation is indicated.
> Falkirk, Dr. E. | 01/14/2003 | User Inactive

SCP-5056-A can be seen by all personnel, but only SCP-5056-B can hear its "voice." It was previously hypothesized that SCP-5056-B was experiencing stress-related psychosis and auditory hallucinations; his claims have since been validated.

SCP-5056-A exhibits a preference for manifesting on glass, particularly lenses. It cannot be photographed, as it causes atomic-level degradation to optical equipment and media on which it manifests.

SCP-5056-A will not engage with entities other than SCP-5056-B. Experimental and incident data demonstrate that it can perceive entities other than Philip E. Deering, but chooses to ignore them.

**Summary:** Technician JM64, Philip E. Deering joined the Janitorial and Maintenance Section of Site-43 on 21 July, 1999. His first three Hiring and Regulation reviews describe a reliable, amiable, but melancholy worker. He maintained sporadic contact with family, including an estranged brother, and engaged in brief romantic relationships invariably terminated by the other party.

SCP-5056-A first appeared to Deering on 9 September 2002 in the second sublevel men's washroom in the Administration and Operations Section of Site-43. Since that time they have been, with only brief exceptions, in constant contact.

SCP-5056-A's disposition toward SCP-5056-B changes rapidly. At times it seeks a visceral reaction from him, opening its scars wide and gurning; at other times it engages him in conversation. Popular topics include mistakes SCP-5056-B has made, social interactions he has botched, absent family members, his personal hygiene and the futility of human existence.

SCP-5056-B has become inured to his counterpart's antics and rarely reacts to them with shock or dismay. He frequently fails to react at all; by 2007 he displayed such degraded responses to sudden audio or visual stimuli that his more technical duties were reassigned to personnel unburdened by supermundane phenomena. He applauds particularly creative, invasive or entertaining assaults by SCP-5056-A, and offers constructive criticism.

SCP-5056-B's shift reports prior to 29 January 2003 exclusively refer to SCP-5056-A using the personal pronoun "it." Reports dated after 29 January 2003 exclusively use male personal pronouns.

Long-term staff of Site-43 have become accustomed to SCP-5056-A, regarding it as an unofficial site mascot. Several personnel have acquired the habit of greeting SCP-5056-A when encountering it, and most have developed nicknames for the apparition. SCP-5056-B himself refers to SCP-5056-A as "Doug." When referring to it indirectly, he uses the term "my Employee of the Month Award." No such award has ever been granted to him; in light of his present duties, no such award is likely forthcoming.

Deteriorations of SCP-5056-B's mental and emotional state projected by his first ten Hiring and Regulation reviews have not occurred.

**EXPERIMENT 5056-RE-01 [09/13/2002]**
**Presiding:** Dr. M. Bradbury, Dr. H. Blank
**Intent:** Establish SCP-5056-A's tolerance for separation from SCP-5056-B.
**Procedure:** SCP-5056-B reported to a testing module containing one steel table and one steel chair. One mirror was mounted in the adjoining hallway.
**Phenomenology:** After precisely nine seconds without line-of-sight to SCP-5056-B, SCP-5056-A became visibly agitated, vibrating so intensely that its features became impossible to distinguish. Simultaneously, a constant tone of 119-kHz was experienced by all occupants of Site-43 not in containment, regardless of hearing ability, protective equipment or distance from the visual anomaly. 
**Analysis:** Brisk and limited further experimentation revealed that returning SCP-5056-B to SCP-5056-A's sightline immediately terminated its agitation and tonal emission. 
**Conclusion:** Separation of these subjects is prejudicial to efficient operations at Site-43.

**EXPERIMENT 5056-RE-02 [09/17/2002]**
**Presiding:** Dr. M. Bradbury
**Intent:** Establish SCP-5056-A's tolerance for restraint.
**Procedure:** SCP-5056-B reported to a testing module containing amenities sufficient for one week's isolation. Dr. Bradbury visited the module every nine hours to receive an oral report from SCP-5056-B.
**Phenomenology:** Experiment was terminated after 81 hours by Dr. Bradbury's admission to the care of the Site-43 Emergency Psychiatric and Amnestic Unit (EPAU).
**Analysis:** During Dr. Bradbury's third visit to the testing module SCP-5056-A manifested in the left lens of her eyeglasses (worn), resulting in her remandance to psychiatric care and eventual resignation from the Foundation. Cellular breakdown of the lens glass was observed.
**Conclusion:** SCP-5056-A has a low tolerance for restraint.

**EXPERIMENT 5056-RE-03 [10/17/2002]**
**Presiding:** Dr. H. Blank
**Intent:** Intercept alleged auditory phenomena associated with SCP-5056-A.
**Procedure:** One digital recording device and one cassette tape recorder were activated and secreted on SCP-5056-B's person. SCP-5056-B was provided with eight one-hour cassette tapes and tasked with replacing them as necessary – outside of SCP-5056-A's visual range.
**Phenomenology:** Review of the digital recording revealed exclusively non-anomalous audio. Review of the analogue recordings revealed SCP-5056-A's harangue of SCP-5056-B on all tapes save the first. A partial transcript of Cassette 5056-10-17-02-C, recorded in the fourth-sublevel Habitation and Sustenance Section cafeteria, follows:

> **Present:** RE31 (Dr. S. Rance), RE32 (Dr. T. Wichman), RE87 (Dr. D. Sokolsky), JM46 (A. Banerjee), HS223 (E. Wyers), SCP-5056-A, SCP-5056-B
> 
> **Dr. Rance:** What the f-... oh. Mr. Deering.
> **SCP-5056-B:** Hey Dr. Rance. Sorry.
> **SCP-5056-A:** Philip.
> **Dr. Rance:** Not like you can help it! Should know better than to daydream in front of a mirror by now. [audio event consistent with metal on porcelain] Have at 'er.
> **SCP-5056-B:** Thanks, sir.
> **Banerjee:** Hey Phil.
> **SCP-5056-B:** Hey. Oh, hey Azad.
> **Banerjee:** *laughter* You awake, there?
> **SCP-5056-B:** Sorry. Yeah. Doug's been acting up lately, didn't get much sleep.
> **Banerjee:** What's he doing now?
> **SCP-5056-B:** Spent all last night whispering the names of every JM who died over the last nine months.
> **SCP-5056-A:** Philip.
> **Banerjee:** Nine months? How do you, uh... know it that specifically?
> **SCP-5056-B:** It was repeating them on loop, Azad. [audio event consistent with metal on linoleum] -hours. Eventually I decided to see if I could remember when each one died, since I wasn't getting any sleep anyway and, yeah, nine months.
> **SCP-5056-A:** Philip.
> **SCP-5056-B:** What, Doug.
> **SCP-5056-A:** They're listening, Philip.
> **SCP-5056-B:** That's great, Doug.
> **Banerjee:** What's he saying?
> **Dr. Sokolsky:** Hey Phil. Hey, Boogerman.
> **SCP-5056-B:** Hey Dr. Sokolsky. Uh, it says they're listening.
> **SCP-5056-A:** They're listening, Philip.
> **Banerjee:** Who's listening?
> **Dr. Wichman:** Deering. Banerjee. Oh, Deering, Wettle's looking for you. Might want to avoid R&E today.
> **SCP-5056-B:** Thanks, Dr. Wichman.
> **Dr. Wichman:** Mhm. [audio event consistent with fingers tapping on glass] Pass me some of those mixed nuts, 5056. I can't get topside for change until next Tuesday.
> **Banerjee:** Who's listening, Phil?
> **SCP-5056-B:** Damned if I know.
> **SCP-5056-A:** They're listening, Philip.
> **SCP-5056-B:** That's terrific, Doug, I'm so happy for you. Why don't you go talk to them?
> **SCP-5056-A:** I can hear them listening, Philip.
> **Dr. Wichman:** Damn thing ate my five again! I swear it only does that when you let 5056 in there, Deering.
> **SCP-5056-B:** I can't very well stop it, Dr. Wichman.
> **Dr. Wichman:** [muttering] perfectly good mirror right there.
> **Banerjee:** Maybe he's bored of mirrors.
> **SCP-5056-A:** I can hear the wheels turning.
> **Banerjee:** I hope he does that thing with the eye slits again today.
> **SCP-5056-A:** And I can hear them listening.
> **SCP-5056-B:** Come on, Doug, we're going to the kitchen. You can play in the silverware drawers.
> **SCP-5056-A:** I can hear them listening, Philip.
> **SCP-5056-B:** Uh-huh.
> **SCP-5056-A:** Philip.
> **Wyers:** Christ, you're on this shift today?
> **SCP-5056-A:** They're listening to you too, Philip.
> **Wyers:** He always scares the shit out of me at least once while you're in here.
> **SCP-5056-B:** You get used to it.

**Analysis:** Both recording devices were initially activated by Dr. Blank, but the analogue recorder was deactivated and reactivated by SCP-5056-B seven times to replace its cassettes. SCP-5056-A was only recorded when SCP-5056-B initiated the recording – though SCP-5056-A did not witness this.
**Conclusion:** SCP-5056-B may himself be anomalous. Further testing is warranted.
> Yes, because this site has been restructured around unnecessarily convoluted containment protocols.

**EXPERIMENT 5056-RE-10 [11/04/2002]**
**Presiding:** Dr. W. Wettle
**Intent:** 1. Replicate results of Experiment 5056-RE-09 ("SCP-5056-A violates the laws of optics, and its recognizance is not sight-based"); 2. Further establish extent of SCP-5056-A's recognizance.
**Procedure:** 1. SCP-5056-B was directed through a course of varied light and atmospheric conditions, as in Experiment 5056-RE-09; 2. SCP-5056-B was removed from the line-of-sight of SCP-5056-A, and his identical twin brother Dougall was introduced in an identical uniform.
**Phenomenology:** 1. SCP-5056-A pursued SCP-5056-B without visual contact, manifesting on unlit (and therefore non-reflective) mirrors; 2. SCP-5056-A ignored the new subject and began tonal emission after nine seconds had elapsed.
**Conclusion:** Definitely something spooky going on here.

**INCIDENT 5056-I-04 [01/29/2003]**

On 14 January 2003, Dr. M█████ was suspended as Director of Site-43 during an inquiry into the 09/08/2002 cascade containment breach in the Directed Occultism and Acroamatic Abatement Sections. Dr. Erasmus Falkirk was designated his pro-tem replacement and arrived at Site-43 later that day, almost immediately encountering both SCP-5056-A and B in the Administration and Operations second sublevel men's washroom. Subsequent to this encounter, SCP-5056-B filed an incident report which was immediately suppressed by Dr. Falkirk.

After consultation with Research and Experimentation personnel Dr. Falkirk executed Experiment 5056-RE-18 on 29 January 2003. His intent was to demonstrate that SCP-5056-B possessed no anomalous qualities and was non-essential for containment of SCP-5056-A.

A testing module with attached observation centre was fitted with an air recycling and control system, one steel table, one steel chair and one hand mirror, placed on the table. Dr. Falkirk instructed SCP-5056-B to enter the observation centre and activate various recording apparatus. This was done. Dr. Falkirk then instructed SCP-5056-B to enter the testing module, which was sealed behind him. The experiment commenced at 18:12:11 EST; a complete audio log is transcribed below.

> **Personnel Present:** AO3 (Dr. E. Falkirk), LT119 (G. Ruan), LT121 (R. Bevan), SCP-5056-A, SCP-5056-B
> 
> **Dr. Falkirk:** Can you hear me, Mr. Deering?
> **SCP-5056-B:** Yes, doctor, I can hear you.
> **Dr. Falkirk:** Sit down.
> **SCP-5056-B:** Alright. Uh, yes sir.
> **SCP-5056-A:** Get out.
> **SCP-5056-B:** Did you hear that, doctor?
> **Dr. Falkirk:** Yes, we heard you.
> **SCP-5056-B:** No, I mean-
> **Dr. Falkirk:** Commence procedure.
> **Ruan:** Confirmed.
> **Dr. Falkirk:** Narrate your experience for us, Mr. Deering.
> **SCP-5056-A:** Get out.
> **SCP-5056-B:** Uh... well, I'm sitting here, and Dou- ...I mean, the skip's in the mirror, and... I don't know, sir, what's this all about?
> **Dr. Falkirk:** How's his respiration?
> **SCP-5056-B:** I'm really sorry about what happened in the bathroom.
> **Ruan:** He'll be feeling it soon. You know, I do miss having a monitor, but this older technology is actually quite-
> **Dr. Falkirk:** Quiet. Let me see the printout.
> **Ruan:** Yes sir.
> **SCP-5056-A:** GET OUT.
> **SCP-5056-B:** JESUS! [loud exhalation] Take a pill, buddy.
> **Dr. Falkirk:** Alright, phase two.
> **Ruan:** I'll need verbal confirmation of that order, doctor.
> **Dr. Falkirk:** Initiate phase two.
> **Ruan:** Confirmed.
> **Dr. Falkirk:** Continue your narration, Mr. Deering.
> **SCP-5056-B:** Uhh... well, actually, I'm feeling kind of... light-headed, right now, and... actually I'm having trouble bre. Breathing?
> **SCP-5056-A:** GET OUT.
> **SCP-5056-B:** We can't... we can't... Doug, hey, what's... going... what's going...
> **Ruan:** He should be unconscious momentarily.
> **SCP-5056-B:** Doug...? I- [percussion event]
> **Ruan:** 5056-B is unconscious.
> **Dr. Falkirk:** He'd better be, or he just heard that.
> **Ruan:** Shit, uh, I mean-
> **Dr. Falkirk:** Eyes on the mirror, gentlemen.
> **Bevan:** 5056-A appears agitated.
> **SCP-5056-A:** Philip?
> **Bevan:** Movement in its facial orifices.
> **SCP-5056-A:** Philip. Wake up.
> **Ruan:** Hypoxia.
> **Dr. Falkirk:** Now we'll see.
> **Bevan:** I think there's a problem with the camera, the skip looks fuzz-
> **Dr. Falkirk:** [incoherent screaming]
> **Bevan:** What the f-
> **Dr. Falkirk:** [incoherent screaming]
> **Ruan:** Is that his EYE?!
> **Dr. Falkirk:** GET OFF GET OFF GET OFF
> **Bevan:** He's going for the other one!

Experiment terminated at 18:14:23 EST. Dr. Falkirk was treated for blood loss and facial trauma, and the loss of his left eye; he was restrained before he could remove his right eye. Directorship of Site-43 devolved to Dr. M█████ at 18:20:00.

SCP-5056-B sustained no permanent injury and resumed his duties after psychological evaluation. 

Dr. Falkirk remains under indefinite suicide watch at Site-17; his concerns over the classification and containment of SCP-5056 are under review.
