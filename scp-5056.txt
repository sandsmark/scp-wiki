**Item #:** SCP-XXXX

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-XXXX is not to be spoken.

**Description:** SCP-XXXX is a specific string of alphanumeric characters from the Roman alphabet, and the recognition thereof. Said recognition is absolutely unique: at any given time, precisely one person can recognize SCP-XXXX. All others interpret its characters as unfamiliar, meaningless and unimportant, will be unable to concentrate on them for more than a few seconds, and will forget them once their attention lapses.

The individual who recognizes SCP-XXXX, its "keeper," is unable to forget it under any circumstances but the following: it must be spoken aloud, character-by-character, in the presence or telepresence of at least one other person. The first person to aurally receive SCP-XXXX will immediately memorize the characters, their sound, and their meaning (if any), and the former keeper will forget these in their entirety.

Any background knowledge a subject possesses about SCP-XXXX is not affected by this memetic effect. New keepers will not recognize the character string as anomalous until they are so informed, or encounter its properties themselves; former keepers do not forget the existence of SCP-XXXX, merely its essence. This essence cannot be reverse-engineered. Deductive reasoning will not allow SCP-XXXX to be "guessed," and no amount of partial knowledge of SCP-XXXX will trigger its effects. It is only imprinted on a subject's consciousness when verbally transmitted in its entirety.

SCP-XXXX has no observable psychological side-effects, and produces no long-term cerebral or cognitive alterations to its keepers.

**Addendum:** SCP-XXXX was "discovered" on 6/08/2003 (see below). Its nature was determined through experimentation; its origin remains unknown. The ongoing need to develop reliable security protocols for Foundation research led to a proposal by Site-43 Identification and Technocryptography Chief Eileen Vaiksaar: ongoing experimental use of SCP-XXXX as a password for projects between clearance Level 3: Confidental and clearance Level 4: Secret. Chief Vaiksaar's proposal was accepted on 02/14/2004, and she became the //de facto/// keeper of SCP-XXXX when not in use, authorized to loan it out on a case-by-case basis. This practice was discontinued on 01/27/2020, and Chief Vaiksaar released SCP-XXXX to the O5 Council; the identity of its present keeper is classified at Level 5: Top Secret.

O5 Council is not accepting requests for the release of SCP-XXXX. Rationale can be found in the I&T usage log excerpts retrived from the 43Net database and reproduced below.

**06/08/2003:** During a routine credentials renewal, Dr. K. Elstrom speaks her 43NET password aloud via telephone to I&T technician W. Barkley. Barkley asks Dr. Elstrom to confirm the password by repeating it; she finds herself unable to do so. Dr. Elstrom asks that Barkley instead repeat the password back to her; when he refuses, citing protocol, she becomes extremely agitated and demands to speak to his supervisor. Barkley places Dr. Elstrom on hold and confers with the I&C supervisor on-call, J. Odala, relaying the above information and the character string to her verbally. Odala suggests that Barkley reset Dr. Elstrom's password and instruct her to choose a new one using the five-point identity confirmation process; when he attempts the reset, which requires the use of Dr. Elstrom's password, he realizes he cannot remember it.

**06/09/2003:** An I&T investigation determines the anomalous nature of the character string and it is transferred from Odala to Eileen Vaiksaar, Chief of I&T. Dr. Elstrom claims, under MARSTON verification protocol, to have no memory of the source of her password. This claim is verified.

**02/14/2004:** After eight months of intermittent study to confirm the laws governing the character string's transmission, it is classified SCP-XXXX and released to Chief Vaiksaar's custody. A registration system is set up to handle applications for its further use as a password in ultra-high sensitivity projects at Site-43.

**02/25/2004 - 02/28/2004:** Dr. E. LeClair claims SCP-XXXX as the password for her tablet computer. Three days later she attempts to violate containment protocols for [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1693 SCP-1693] at Sector-25. When apprehended, she admits to undertaking private research for the treatment of Alzheimer's Disease. Health and Pathology Section assessment at Site-43 reveals that Dr. LeClair suffers from Mild Cognitive Impairment, proceeding rapidly to mild dementia. I&T reports multiple password requests originating from her office over the past month. Dr. LeClair willingly surrenders SCP-XXXX to Chief Vaiksaar, and requests amnesticization and retirement to intermediate care. Her requests are granted.

**05/22/2004 - 05/23/2004:** Dr. T. Bremmel claims SCP-XXXX as the password for a secure network database. Site-43 Security and Containment Section is alerted to a containment breach scenario in Dr. Bremmel's office the next day. Agents discover a Post-it note on Dr. Bremmel's terminal, containing his login information. At an emergency disciplinary hearing Dr. Bremmel reveals that the password on the note is not SCP-XXXX, but is instead a keyword pre-emptively flagged with S&C. Dr. Bremmel is detained at his own request, and his removal from Site-43 is announced via 43Net.

**05/26/2004:** Dr. Bremmel's former research assistant, Dr. S. Mollins, attempts three times to use the login and password from the Post-it note to remotely access Dr. Bremmel's secure database from his own office terminal. Charged with unauthorized access to a secured workspace and attempted credentials theft, Dr. Mollins is removed to Site-06-3 for detention. Dr. Bremmel returns SCP-XXXX to Chief Vaiksaar, never having used it.

**03/26/2005 - 05/17/2005:** Dr. D. Sokolsky claims SCP-XXXX for use as a research group FTP password. He instructs his colleagues to telephone him for a new, one-time password before uploading their data each day. He actually recites SCP-XXXX to them each time, asking that they repeat it back to him before completing the log-on process. At the conclusion of the research project Dr. Sokolsky creates a new, non-anomalous password for the FTP system and returns SCP-XXXX to Chief Vaiksaar.

**06/12/2005:** Dr. Sokolsky publishes the research group's work as his own at the Site-43 All-Sections Symposium. When his colleagues protest, he challenges their credentials and asks them to prove their group membership by reciting any one of the previous FTP passwords, which they obviously cannot do. He then publishes the results of a second, secret program of research on the security implications of SCP-XXXX, detailing the above actions in full, and is immediately promoted to Senior Researcher in Memetics and Countermemetics.

**08/17/2006 - 11/15/2006:** Dr. L. Lillihammer claims SCP-XXXX for use as a vocal activation code for an adaptive security program derived from [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3355 SCP-3355]. On 11/14/2006 she attempts to activate the system as usual, but finds that it has already activated itself — having become artificially intelligent — and immediately forgets SCP-XXXX. She negotiates its return to her (via vocoder) in exchange for promises to build a robotic host for the security program. After fully wiping her computer systems and returning SCP-XXXX to Chief Vaiksaar, Dr. Lillihammer informs Site-43 S&C of these events. A reprimand is issued, but in light of her honesty no further action is taken save for her permanent loss of SCP-XXXX privileges.

**11/17/2007 - 11/18/2007:** Dr. T. Bremmel claims SCP-XXXX for use in an experimental security system. A proximity alarm is tripped in his office one day later; he remotely recites SCP-XXXX through his office intercom, and instructs Site-43 S&C to detain his former research assistant, Dr. O. Ostroy. Agents confront Dr. Ostroy in his own office, where he denies Dr. Bremmel's charges of unauthorized entry and theft of research materials. Under enhanced interrogation by S&C Agent K. Yancy, however, Dr. Ostroy recites SCP-XXXX and is removed to Site-06-3 for detention. Agent Yancy returns SCP-XXXX to Chief Vaiksaar.

Eastover's office and research suite at Site-66 the next day. Dr. Howard is apprehended while trying to escape off-site, and questioned; he claims to be an agent of the Chaos Insurgency GOI, and to have used SCP-XXXX as the vocal activation key to an explosive device in Dr. Eastover's office, delivered by calling Dr. Eastover's answering machine and reciting it.

**Addendum:** While the potential for misuse presented by SCP-XXXX is considerable, proposals for its decommissioning have so far been rejected. As it is unclear whether killing its present keeper would permanently destroy SCP-XXXX, or cause it to manifest in some other context, the risks far outweigh the benefits (if any).
