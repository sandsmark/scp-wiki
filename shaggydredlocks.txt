|| **Note from The Administrator:** SCP-AU has began to narrate SCP files to the public. Though this constitutes a massive containment breach, he possesses such a deeply alluring voice that we simply cannot bear to take it down. _

**Item #:** SCP-AU

**Object Class:** I Can't Believe It's Not Contained!^^TM^^

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-AU is to be contained within its hovel behind the dumpster at the Arby's next to Site-19. It is to be fed pre-chewed Slim Jims every full moon, by personnel dressed as Richard Simmons. In order to lessen the psychological stress from interacting with SCP-AU, absolutely no verbal communication with the entity is authorized. [[footnote]] SCP-AU is a huge dick, and will make fun of your nasally voice. [[/footnote]]

**Description:** SCP-AU is a humanoid entity comprised entirely of weasels. Despite this, it believes itself to be a non-anomalous human, and will become aggressive if confronted about its appearance. SCP-AU believes it is a researcher at Site-19, and claims to have been involved with the initial containment of the following SCPs.

**Addendum Uno:** SCP-AU has taken to writing what it refers to as 'Tales'. It does this by using feces collected from its constituent weasels. Several D-Class have been assigned to transcribe these stories, in order to gain information on SCP-AU.

**Addendumb**

SCP-AU has somehow gotten its many, many tiny mitts on internal documentation from rival GOIs. We're not going to ask it what it had to do to obtain them.
