This was my first successful article on the site, but it's also probably my weakest. I started with what is admittedly a dumb core concept (Hollywood as a skip), and while the execution is strong enough to make it work, it could be better. One of the biggest issues I had writing it was finding a way to satisfactorily and conclusively end it. And the example cognitohazards I used could probably have been made more varied and interesting. I'll probably end up going back and rewriting this at some point to fix these issues.

Still, at least I can say that I turned Hollywood into a skip.

This one went from idea to posted in less than three days, and then from 0 to +50 net upvotes in less than two. Turns out, people love crazy wacky baseball. I certainly did. This was a fun skip to write, and even more fun to see people's reactions to it. I actually ended up putting a lot of research into this, and it shows in the fact that over half of the alternate universe team names are historical references. Including the Toronto Razors.

Written in about a week as a result of TwistedGears telling me to write a PL thing. To his dismay, I then went a wrote a GOI Format article. This one ended up turning out pretty well, even managing to get to 24 upvotes before anyone downvoted it.
