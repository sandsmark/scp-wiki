* **[[[scp-2163 |SCP-2163 – Lights... Camera... Containment!]]]**

[[collapsible show="+Reveal My Commentaries" hide="-BEGONE FROM MY SIGHT!"]]
This was my first successful article on the site, but it's also probably my weakest. I started with what is admittedly a dumb core concept (Hollywood as a skip), and while the execution is strong enough to make it work, it could be better. One of the biggest issues I had writing it was finding a way to satisfactorily and conclusively end it. And the example cognitohazards I used could probably have been made more varied and interesting. I'll probably end up going back and rewriting this at some point to fix these issues.

Still, at least I can say that I turned Hollywood into a skip.

* **[[[scp-2206 |SCP-2206 – Maximum League Baseball]]]**

[[collapsible show="+Reveal My Commentaries" hide="-BEGONE FROM MY SIGHT!"]]
This one went from idea to posted in less than three days, and then from 0 to +50 net upvotes in less than two. Turns out, people love crazy wacky baseball. I certainly did. This was a fun skip to write, and even more fun to see people's reactions to it. I actually ended up putting a lot of research into this, and it shows in the fact that over half of the alternate universe team names are historical references. Including the Toronto Razors.

* **[[[scp-2176 |SCP-2176 – Ghostlight™]]]**

[[collapsible show="+Reveal My Commentaries" hide="-BEGONE FROM MY SIGHT!"]]
My purpose when writing this wasn't so much to tell a story about using ghosts to power lightbulbs, but to use that as a backdrop for a story about how the Foundation deals with minor GOIs and the market for anomalous items. It also does a nice little bit of worldbuilding for Prometheus Labs, and gives, in my opinion, a very nice clinical summary of the science of ghosts.

I'm not surprised that its gotten such mixed reviews as it has. It clashes pretty strongly with some people's headcanons, and I knew that going in. But it did what I wanted it to do, and it's popular enough that it looks like it'll stay on the mainlist. And, I enjoyed writing it.

++ Tales

* **[[[the-flight-of-daedalus |The Flight of Daedalus]]]**

[[collapsible show="+Reveal My Commentaries" hide="-BEGONE FROM MY SIGHT!"]]
This is the first tale in what will eventually be a tale series depicting the SPACE ADVENTURES of the ISV //Daedalus//. This particular piece is pretty character driven, introducing various important characters and setting the stage for later tales. The ending is, perhaps, not as strong as it could be, but making it a twist ending and simultaneously allowing for future tales is not (easily) possible.

Also, Arkwright will be important in the future. Not in the //Daedalus// tale series though. But eventually.

* **[[[grant-request-for-utilization-of-electro-thaumic-computers-t |GRANT REQUEST FOR UTILIZATION OF ELECTRO-THAUMIC COMPUTERS TO PERFORM EXORCISMS OF DEMONIC ENTITIES]]]**

[[collapsible show="+Reveal My Commentaries" hide="-BEGONE FROM MY SIGHT!"]]
Written in about a week as a result of TwistedGears telling me to write a PL thing. To his dismay, I then went and wrote a GOI Format article. This one ended up turning out pretty well, even managing to get to 24 upvotes before anyone downvoted it.

Prometheus Labs has always felt like one of the more underutilized GOIs to me. There's a whole lot of potential there that's been untapped, or been squandered on "lol stuff blows up because we're dumb" depictions. My attempt here was to depict what a research company that routinely works with anomalous and poorly understood objects would actually be like. Instead of building automatic dishwashers, they build automatic exorcists.

Overall, I had a lot of fun with this one.

* **[[[grant-request-for-the-construction-of-an-interstellar-scienc |GRANT REQUEST FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF AN INTERSTELLAR SCIENCE VESSEL]]]**

[[collapsible show="+Reveal My Commentaries" hide="-BEGONE FROM MY SIGHT!"]]
What started out as an attempt to write a black hole power generator quickly developed into a black hole powered starship. Probably one of the hardest sci-fi pieces on this site, a lot of research went into this one. The entire thing is actually plausible under real physics, just many many many years beyond our tech level.

I'm looking forward to writing Prometheus Labs SPACE ADVENTURES aboard their shiny black hole starship.
