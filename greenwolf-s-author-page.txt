* **[[[scp-2163 |SCP-2163 – Lights... Camera... Containment!]]]**

[[collapsible show="+Reveal My Commentaries" hide="-BEGONE FROM MY SIGHT!"]]
This was my first successful article on the site, but it's also probably my weakest. I started with what is admittedly a dumb core concept (Hollywood as a skip), and while the execution is strong enough to make it work, it could be better. One of the biggest issues I had writing it was finding a way to satisfactorily and conclusively end it. And the example cognitohazards I used could probably have been made more varied and interesting. I'll probably end up going back and rewriting this at some point to fix these issues..

Still, at least I can say that I turned Hollywood into a skip.

* **[[[scp-2206 |SCP-2206 – Maximum League Baseball]]]**

[[collapsible show="+Reveal My Commentaries" hide="-BEGONE FROM MY SIGHT!"]]
This one went from idea to posted in less than three days, and then from 0 to +50 net upvotes in less than two. Turns out, people love crazy wacky baseball. I certainly did. This was a fun skip to write, and even more fun to see people's reactions to it. I actually ended up putting a lot of research into this, and it shows in the fact that over half of the alternate universe team names are historical references. Including the Toronto Razors.

Addendum: On reflection, this article is interesting, as it differs significantly from most of my other work. While later works (and 2163 before it) are characterized by a focus on science and technology with a relatively dry and serious tone, this one is, well, a skip about wacky alternate universe baseball.

* **[[[scp-2176 |SCP-2176 – Ghostlight™]]]**

[[collapsible show="+Reveal My Commentaries" hide="-BEGONE FROM MY SIGHT!"]]
My purpose when writing this wasn't so much to tell a story about using ghosts to power lightbulbs, but to use that as a backdrop for a story about how the Foundation deals with minor GOIs and the market for anomalous items. It also does a nice little bit of worldbuilding for Prometheus Labs, and gives, in my opinion, a very nice clinical summary of the science of ghosts.

I'm not surprised that its gotten such mixed reviews as it has. It clashes pretty strongly with some people's headcanons, and I knew that going in. But it did what I wanted it to do, and it's popular enough that it looks like it'll stay on the mainlist. And, I enjoyed writing it.

* **[[[scp-2308 |SCP-2308 – Car Futures Trading]]]**

[[collapsible show="+Reveal My Commentaries" hide="-BEGONE FROM MY SIGHT!"]]
This was one of those things that went from concept to completion incredibly quickly. Inspired by a joke I made on IRC about car manufacturers selling next year's model in mid-summer, I quickly wrote this skip in a single afternoon, then posted it the next morning. I never could have expected the overwhelmingly positive response it received – within 12 hours, it had already gotten over 50 upvotes.

I've had someone describe this to me as a "more entertaining version of Ghostlight", which is a pretty accurate assessment; it uses almost the exact same formula as Ghostlight. But while Ghostlight is currently sitting in the mid-20s, 2308 continues to accrue more and more votes. It's interesting to speculate what differences between the two could have caused this difference in reception.

++ Tales

* **The Flight of Daedalus** (DELETED)

[[collapsible show="+Reveal My Commentaries" hide="-BEGONE FROM MY SIGHT!"]]
This is the first tale in what will eventually be a tale series depicting the SPACE ADVENTURES of the ISV //Daedalus//. This particular piece is pretty character driven, introducing various important characters and setting the stage for later tales. The ending is, perhaps, not as strong as it could be, but making it a twist ending and simultaneously allowing for future tales is not (easily) possible.

Also, Arkwright will be important in the future. Not in the //Daedalus// tale series though. But eventually.

Addendum: So that promised tale series never materialized. I've debated just deleting this one, and maybe reposting it later after a significant rewrite. However, I feel like the "quantum ending" it uses allows for some nice ambiguity. Did the Daedalus break apart in orbit or not? I will almost certainly hit this with some rewrites, but it will, for the foreseeable future, remain a standalone work.

Arkwright is still important though.

Addendum: So, I deleted this one. I'll be preserving the commentary for future historians, however.

+++ Prometheus Labs

* **[[[grant-request-for-utilization-of-electro-thaumic-computers-t |GRANT REQUEST FOR UTILIZATION OF ELECTRO-THAUMIC COMPUTERS TO PERFORM EXORCISMS OF DEMONIC ENTITIES]]]**

[[collapsible show="+Reveal My Commentaries" hide="-BEGONE FROM MY SIGHT!"]]
Written in about a week as a result of TwistedGears telling me to write a PL thing. To his dismay, I then went and wrote a GOI Format article. This one ended up turning out pretty well, even managing to get to 24 upvotes before anyone downvoted it.

Prometheus Labs has always felt like one of the more underutilized GOIs to me. There's a whole lot of potential there that's been untapped, or been squandered on "lol stuff blows up because we're dumb" depictions. My attempt here was to depict what a research company that routinely works with anomalous and poorly understood objects would actually be like. Instead of building automatic dishwashers, they build automatic exorcists.

Overall, I had a lot of fun with this one.

Addendum: This one really establishes the tone and style that my future works (up to this point) would take. Although SCP-2163 is somewhat similar, it isn't quite as heavy on the technical/scientific writing and details that have come to characterize my works. Electronic exorcist, however, marks the point where I began focusing most of my articles on Prometheus Labs, and the subsequent shift to a more technical-focused style.

* **[[[grant-request-for-the-construction-of-an-interstellar-scienc |GRANT REQUEST FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF AN INTERSTELLAR SCIENCE VESSEL]]]**

[[collapsible show="+Reveal My Commentaries" hide="-BEGONE FROM MY SIGHT!"]]
What started out as an attempt to write a black hole power generator quickly developed into a black hole powered starship. Probably one of the hardest sci-fi pieces on this site, a lot of research went into this one. The entire thing is actually plausible under real physics, just many many many years beyond our tech level.

I'm looking forward to writing Prometheus Labs SPACE ADVENTURES aboard their shiny black hole starship.

Addendum: As mentioned above, those space adventures never really got off the ground. While I enjoyed writing this grant request and the first Daedalus tale, I wrote myself into a sort of creative dead end, where anything else I wrote on the subject just didn't satisfy me.

* **[[[grant-request-for-investigating-the-potential-application-of |GRANT REQUEST FOR INVESTIGATING THE APPLICATION OF CERTAIN RESEARCH ASSETS IN OVERCOMING INHERENT LIMITATIONS OF THE HUMAN BODY]]]**

[[collapsible show="+Reveal My Commentaries" hide="-BEGONE FROM MY SIGHT!"]]
This was written for the [[[mobile-task-force-contest |Mobile Task Force Contest]]] of 2016, and was the GOI format entry for Team Apotheosis. It focuses on PL's discovery of the corpse of a dead God, and what they intend to do with it. It also gives further insight into the whole "how can we exploit this weird supernatural thing for good/science" thing they have going on, which is nice.

Is it a great standalone work? Eh, maybe. It's certainly not the most interesting grant request I've written, but it was good enough to post, and I'm mostly happy with it.

Interesting bit of trivia: the original title of this article was longer than what Wikidot allows for titles, forcing me to cut a word from it to get it to fit. You can see what the original title would have been based on the url.

Ha! You thought there was something here. This is actually just a filler tab to make all the tabs line up nicely without too much trailing whitespace.

It may also be a mini-sandbox for testing formatting on things that can't be done in the sandbox, but I refuse to confirm or deny those allegations.
