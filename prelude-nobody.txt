//Yesterday upon the stair//
//I met a man who wasn't there//
//He wasn't there again today//
//I wish, I wish he'd go away//

**-//Antigonish//, by Hughes Mearns, 1899**

Gray fedora, tilted just so; slate gray suit, well-tailored; white shirt, pressed and starched; black necktie, hanging like a noose.

He straightened his jacket one last time, solemnly tipped his hat to the empty room, and stepped through the doorway.
