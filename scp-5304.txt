**Special Containment Procedures:** Foundation webcrawler SIGMA-09-XEGEL is to monitor the Google Maps database for reviews of SCP-5304. Standard information suppression measures should be enacted to remove these reviews.

> **Containment Update 4/8/2020:** MTF Sigma-14 ("REDDIT MENACE") is to monitor and suppress online discussion of SCP-5304. Cover Story APOSTRA-φ “Collaborative Fiction” is to be disseminated to reduce public interest in SCP-5304 whenever discussion of the phenomenon occurs online.

> **Containment Update 23/8/2020:** Two additional specialized webcrawlers (SIGMA-10-REMOVEDDIT and SIGMA-11-ERADICATEDDIT) have been deployed to monitor for the presence of SCP-5304 keywords. Any online discussion of SCP-5304 should be removed from civilian access as early as possible after discovery. Visual antimemetic agents should be deployed as deemed necessary.

> **Containment Update 6/9/2020:** In the event that civilians attempt to travel to or approach the building designated as SCP-5304, MTF Sigma-14 agents are to deter entry by any means necessary.

**Description:** SCP-5304 is the persistent phenomenon of the internet location service Google Maps labeling an abandoned storage building in West Virginia as “SCP Foundation - Site 50”. No such site is, nor ever has been, owned by the Foundation.

The phenomenon is anomalously resistant to information suppression techniques; all efforts aimed at removing the designation of "SCP Foundation - Site 50" or reducing its visibility have been unsuccessful. In addition, all attempts at isolating the IP address of the person or persons maintaining this designation have been unsuccessful.

This effect is compounded by the fact that current suppression technology does not allow the instantaneous removal of sensitive information from civilian web services, including Google; at present, reviews of SCP-5304 remain accessible to civilian browsers for an average of 48 hours before removal by embedded Foundation agents. The improvement of current information suppression protocol is considered a high priority.

Investigation into the origin, nature, and purpose of SCP-5304 is ongoing.

**Addendum 5304-1: Discovery**
Foundation webcrawler SIGMA-09-XEGEL registered sensitive keywords in the Google Maps service on 30/7/2020. SIGMA-09-XEGEL attempted to forcibly remove the location designation; when it was unable to do so, it alerted Site-15 researchers to the anomaly. After all manual attempts at removal were unsuccessful, SCP-5304 was deemed a priority due to information security concerns, classified, and issued its current containment procedures.

Preliminary examination of the building subject to the SCP-5304 phenomenon revealed it to be a non-anomalous storage facility, showing signs of having been abandoned for upwards of twenty years.

At the time of containment, no civilian visits to the Google Maps location labeled "SCP Foundation - Site 50" had been recorded.

------

**Addendum 5304-2**
A theorized memetic effect of SCP-5304 has resulted in public interest in SCP-5304 steadily increasing, despite strict adherence to information suppression protocol. Numerous observations provide evidence for this conclusion: a marked uptick in traffic to the address of SCP-5304, an increase in reviews posted to SCP-5304, and the creation of threads discussing the phenomenon on minor forums pertaining to conspiracy theories. Creation of a dedicated Mobile Task Force is pending approval.

Analysis of these observations suggested the involvement of GoI-5869 (“Gamers Against Weed”). The following are chat logs relevant to the origin of SCP-5304.

**Incident 5304-1**
On 22/8/2020, SIGMA-09-XEGEL alerted Site-15 to the presence of a direct link to SCP-5304 on the social network website "Reddit". Containment procedures were assessed and updated accordingly.

During the 62-hour period before the post was removed by embedded Foundation agents, Cover Story APOSTRA-φ “Collaborative Fiction” was deployed to mitigate the breach. Efficacy was variable.

**Incident 5304-2**
On 6/9/2020, the popular channel "N████"  on the video sharing site “YouTube” uploaded a video discussing the SCP-5304 phenomenon.

The video received 276,351 views and 2,976 comments before embedded Foundation agents were able to remove the video from public access; plans to remove the "N████" channel from public access via continuous false DMCA strikes are underway.

Armed MTF Sigma-14 agents have been preemptively dispatched to the building at SCP-5304's coordinates.

**Addendum 5304-3:** OMEGA-355144450437021697 logged the following discussion of SCP-5304 in a GoI-5869-affiliated chat room prior to becoming compromised.
