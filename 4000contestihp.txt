**Planetary Catalog Designation:** SCP-4000

**Threat Level:** 0 Interstellar, 10 Surface-Bound

**Resources:** High amounts of organic and inorganic carbon, very high amounts of salinated dihydrogen monoxide, assorted proto-Protectorate weaponry.

**Special Control Protocols:** SCP-4000 is currently unsuited for permanent habitation. Due to the high content of dihydrogen monoxide on its surface and atmosphere, 19 satellites acting as water extraction facilities will be deployed in low SCP-4000 orbit. These satellites will siphon the salinated dihydrogen monoxide while minimizing risk to Protectorate workers. 

The surface of SCP-4000 is currently home to several aquatic and terrestrial entities that possess a threat to Protectorate workers and citizens. As such, following the exhaustion of SCP-4000's dihydrogen monoxide, as well as any other relevant resources, it is to be quarantined.

**Description:** SCP-4000 refers to the planet formerly known as Earth. SCP-4000 possesses a biosphere suitable for supporting carbon-based, oxygen-breathing life forms, but has little land mass suitable for supporting non-liquid-dwelling life forms, with a land:water ratio of approximately 10:90.

SCP-4000 was the home planet of //Homo sapiens sapiens//, a species of sapient organism which was once prevalent throughout the Sol system. //Homo sapiens sapiens// colonized several areas in the Sol system, including the planets Mars and Venus, as well as Titan, the largest moon of the planet Hephaestia[[footnote]]The sixth planet in the Sol system, homeworld of the Mekhanion, a species of sapient techno-organic beings.[[/footnote]], using primitive spacefaring technology, including rudimentary FTL travel.

SCP-4000 was largely abandoned between GSC 10997 and 11001 due to the proliferation of thousands of entities, objects, events and phenomena known to //Homo sapiens// as "SCPs" following the planet's encounter with a Class-10 Behemoth Entity. The "SCP" designation does not appear to be related to the Stellar Congressional Protectorate or any of its sub-organizations. 

According to //Homo sapiens// historical records, "SCPs" are objects which have properties which were once believed to be abnormal in nature, and were cataloged by an organization known as the "Triumvirate"[[footnote]]So called due to the most prominent symbol being a set of three arrows, pointing inwards.[[/footnote]]. The classification of "SCP" objects as "anomalous" is largely due to a lack of scientific, cultural, or historical understanding by //Homo sapiens sapiens//. The Triumvirate organization, in particular, focused alternately on the detention or destruction of "SCP" objects, as opposed to scientific study or interaction with sapient objects.

Most knowledge of the "Triumvirate" comes from artificial satellites left by this organization in orbit around SCP-4000 containing documentation written in a pictographic format, presumably for ease of understanding to later civilizations. The number of "SCP" objects cataloged by the "Triumvirate" is estimated to be over 4,000.

Below is a list of assorted "SCPs" cataloged by the "Triumvirate", and translated by agents of the Protectorate.

+++ A guide to Triumvirate Pictographs

A white symbol has a numerical value of "1". A grey symbol with no barriers between individual squares indicates "0".

A magenta symbol has a numerical value of "2", and is used in conjunction with white symbols to denote numbers greater than "5".

Blue symbols are verbs, or mathematical modifiers. A cross indicates "adds to", a dash indicates "subtracts from", and a pair of horizontal bars indicates "equals".

Yellow symbols are nouns.

Green symbols denote positive or safe.

Red symbols denote negative or danger.

Orange blocks indicate the symbols within represent a chemical formula.

Black squares are null. Black lines appear to denote barriers between symbols.

[[include component:image-block name=http://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/ihp/173pictogram1.png|caption=Pictograph for Item "173"|width=300px]]

Of note in this pictogram is the presence of a the depiction of what is believed to be potassium cyanide (pictured in the third row). This chemical is fatally toxic to most known carbon-based life-forms, including //Homo sapiens//, and has been interpreted as "Item causes death" or "item kills".

An attached picture, of the 173 item though heavily bleached, shows a similar body shape to the //Koshi// drones used briefly by the Black Shroud rebels in the rigel system, suggesting the 173 item is a precursor to these items.



[[include component:image-block name=http://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/ihp/914pictogram.png|caption=Pictograph for Item "914"|width=300px]]

The "914" document included a pattern for a frequency on the electromagnetic spectrum, which is evidently to be used to locate the "914" item. An expedition to the surface of SCP-4000 located parts of what is believed to be a GEAR device, used in most Challenger-class spacecraft. As it was incomplete

**Number:** 882

**Level:** 2/5

**Containment:** Keep in liquid, at least 40% solution of H20+NaCl (salt water). Suspended by (Unknown organic compound) fiber, must be kept (in ill repair? degraded) at all times.

**Description:** Assembly of basic mechanical parts (gears, pulleys, screws, etc), susceptible to damage by H20+NaCl solution. Assimilates other metal items into it. Very durable. Not to be brought near items 217 or 271[[footnote]]These items have yet to be located in any extant record of the Triumvirate.[[/footnote]].

[[/div]]

The description of this object closely matches a holy relic of the Mekhanion. Furthermore, Mekhanion scripture references an entity known as the "Three-Pronged Army" which worked alongside them to defeat an entity known as "Karcka"; illuminated passages appear to depict a symbol similar to those seen on Triumvirate documentation When asked for clarification, Eternal Priest Bumarion answered: "The past is rusted.[[footnote]]"Rust" is a form of rare metal degradation which occurs when iron or steel oxidizes. The Mekhanion believe that rust is a natural part of the life cycle, and actively promote rusting of their technological components by standing within the rings of Hephaestia.[[/footnote]] They gave much for us. The future is starbound."'

**Number:** 2000[[footnote]]The literal pictographs read "Two/null/null/null"; in this case, the "null" instances are equated to "0".[[/footnote]]

**Level:** 1/5

(At this point, the document contained an informational repellent, which was bypassed through use of a memetic scrubber. The scrubber detected the presence of a photograph and an omnilingual meme which read "Remember us".)

**Containment:** Locate. Plead. Location Includes knowledge, genetics, cartography. 

**Description:** Large complex. Resurrection imagery. SCP-4000 in flames, and then intact. Pictographs indicating it was built by "Triumvirate". Alterations. Warning symbols. Another omnilingual meme, which contained a stanza of poetry from an unknown source: "Do not go gentle into that good night. Rage, rage against the dying of the light."

[[/div]]

The remains of the "2000" item were located in the center of a large crater, apparently caused by the eruption of a supervolcano some time following the exodus of //Homo sapiens// from SCP-4000. It is unknown why the "2000" item was built in such close proximity to this geological feature.



[[include component:image-block name=http://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/ihp/hexapodextinction.png|caption=Pictograph 4000-1202, speculated to be the evolution of early life on SCP-4000.|width=300px]]


Pictograph 4000-1202 is anachronistic, as it is believed to show a bipedal organism; no bipedal organisms are known to have existed during this time.

[[div style="display: inline-block; border:dashed 1px #999999; background:#F5F5F5; float:center; width:84%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px"]]


[[include component:image-block name=http://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/ihp/dinosaurpictogram2.png|caption=Pictograph 4000-1265|width=300px]]

A four-limbed organism becomes bipedal over the course of three images, believed to be a crude depiction of evolution on SCP-4000. The next image shows that quadrupedal organisms still exist.

Bipedal and quadrupedal organisms co-exist. The scale of these organisms is unclear, as is the intended meaning; due to the lack of organisms which resemble //Homo sapiens//, it is assumed that this pictogram depicts a time before they evolved. Ancient human media indicates that these organisms may be species of the clade //Dinosauria//, rendered largely extinct (with the exception of the theropod suborder) by the time humanity evolved. Efforts to revive species from this clade were undertaken, with little success.

An orange symbol, believed to contain a representation of iridium [[footnote]]Image literally reads "7null7", which has been interpreted as 77, the atomic number of this element.[[/footnote]], is overlaid on an image of SCP-4000. The image is repeated once, with a "negative" symbol over it, indicating it is incorrect. The meaning of this is unclear, possibly indicating that iridium is no present on SCP-4000, which is also incorrect. Analysis by probes have shown that iridium is present on SCP-4000, albeit in minute quantities, indicating that it was brought to SCP-4000 by way of meteor and asteroid impacts.

A red symbol, identical to the one seen in Pictograph-4000-1020, consuming one of the organisms.

[[/div]]

This series of pictographs is believed to depict the prehistory of organic life on Earth. A second set, depicting its historical record, is also extant. Due to the abstract nature of several pictographs (which may correspond to religions, states, individuals, technology or concepts that are no longer extant) only pieces relevant to the "Triumvirate" are presented.

[[div style="display: inline-block; border:dashed 1px #999999; background:#F5F5F5; float:center; width:84%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px"]]

[[include component:image-block name=http://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/ihp/foundationhistorypictogram.png | caption=Either the history or the mission of the Triumvirate organization.|width=300px]]

The first image shows four //Homo sapiens// standing in a row.

The second image shows one of these //Homo sapiens// being transformed into a green organism; the hue of green used here is distinct from the hue used to indicate "safe" or "positive".

Third image is similar, but depicts the green organism oppressing or killing a pair //Homo sapiens// with an unknown force.

The fourth image shows the three arrows of the Triumvirate symbol, in white, enclosing themselves around the green figure. The fourth figure is shown with their arms extended in the direction of the arrows and the figure, implying that they are the ones enclosing it.

The fifth image shows a quadrapedal entity and a black void enclosed in the three arrows; the meaning of the symbols is unclear, but appear to represent items contained by this organization. The number "4" followed by 3 "null" symbols indicates that there are at 4,000 of items such as these.

The sixth image is a map of SCP-4000 for the majority of the existence of //Homo sapiens sapiens//. Several locations are in green; due to the current state of SCP-4000, it is impossible to correlate these locations to areas present on the planet. 

The seventh image depicts SCP-4000 as it appeared immediately before the departure of //Homo sapiens sapiens//. Referred to by extant //H. sapiens sapiens// as "Inundation"[[footnote]]Literally "the flood"[[/footnote]], this event was triggered by an entity portrayed in another series of pictographs.

[[/div]]

The Pictograph depicting the history or mission of the Trimvirate does not give any indication as to when in human history the organization was formed. Other pictographs show the symbol first appearing around the invention of primitive firearms, but they may have existed much earlier.

 
[[div style="display: inline-block; border:dashed 1px #999999; background:#F5F5F5; float:center; width:84%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px"]]

[[include component:image-block  name=http://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/ihp/destroyerpictogram.png|caption=Pictograph-4000-1050.|width=300px]]

A large entity is attempting to consume SCP-4000. The exact size is unknown, but it appears to be several times larger than the planet it is consuming, possibly the Class-10 Behemoth Entity that is responsible for the current state of SCP-4000.

The "mantle" of the organism attacking SCP-4000 is red, filled with a yellow substance. It is unknown what objects it is consuming while doing this.

[[/div]]

Pictograph-4000-1050 is believed to be the oldest known depiction of an entity termed by //Homo sapiens sapiens// as "Destroyer", and seems to be what the Triumvirate termed "SCP-4000". Extant humans treat the "Destroyer" as an anti-deific figure, responsible for the destruction of their homeworld. It is estimated the "Destroyer" entity killed 90% of life on SCP-4000, including 95% of all //Homo sapiens//.

A theory put forth in Galactic Year 50025 suggests that the "SCP" objects present on SCP-4000 were used to combat the "Destroyer" entity. This is unlikely, as the majority of extant humans treat "SCP" objects as anathematic.

+++ Destruction of SCP-4000:

In Galactic Year 54000, a Class-10 Behemoth Entity, matching the description of the Destroyer, approached the Sol system at near-light speeds, on a direct collision course with SCP-4000. Most Protectorate personnel and citizens were able to evacuate the system. The population of Hephestia was unwilling to evacuate, despite being offered a position on a small Protectorate fleet. Hephestia was entirely ignored by the the Behemoth Entity.

Upon it reaching the remains of SCP-4000's moon, the following message was broadcast to all Protectorate ships within range of Sol.

++++ Proposed Update to SCP-4000 File:

**Planetary Catalog Designation:** SCP-4000

**Threat Level:** N/A

**Resources:** N/A

**Special Control Protocols:** N/A

**Description:** SCP-4000 referred to a planet formerly known as Earth, prior to its use as a weapon in the destruction of an entity which would have consumed the majority of the Sol system. SCP-4000 was launched at this entity (designated "Destroyer", after an anti-deific being present in //Homo sapiens// culture) at FTL speeds using an unknown propulsion system, resulting in the near-complete atomization of both it and the "Destroyer" entity.

Immediately prior to SCP-4000's destruction, the following pictogram was sent from its surface. The meaning of it is unclear.
