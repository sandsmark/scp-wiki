**Item #:** SCP-1462

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Level A HazMat gear is mandatory for interaction with SCP-XXX. The Foundation's role in containment is largely preventative- in the case of containment failure, implanted agents are to convince civilian leadership of the importance of maintaining respiratory protection. Civilians seen unprotected are to be taken into custody and processed for signs of infection. Cover stories for individuals "lost in the blaze" are in place with all major media outlets.

Regular sweeps for signs of SCP-1462 infection are to be performed near known SCP-1462 active sites. Trees infected with the fungal vector for SCP-1462 are to be removed and mulched. Other infected specimens are to be removed and destroyed. All remains of infected specimens are to be disposed of via biohazard incinerator and bleached before disposal. While spores of the fungal vector have proven flame-resistant and are capable of surviving incineration, bleached ashes require no special handling.

**Description:** SCP-1462 is a strain of airborne virus transmitted via fungal spores. The fungus is dangerous only to trees, but spores can infect both plants and animals with the virus. This virus causes the host organisms to replace their natural fluids with petroleum analogues[[footnote]] This is achieved by altering porphyrins, such as heme in blood cells and chlorophyll in plants, to replace their contained ion with a vanadium ion through a process yet to be completely understood[[/footnote]].  [[div style="float:right; margin:0 2em 1em 2em; width:300px; border:0;"]]

In animals, this conversion results in widespread chronic cutaneous and hepatic porphyria symptoms[[footnote]] Symptoms include photosensitivity (photodermatitis), blisters, necrosis of the skin and gums, itching and swelling, increased hair growth on areas such as the forehead, abdominal pain, vomiting, acute neuropathy, muscle weakness, seizures and mental disturbances, including hallucinations, depression, anxiety, and paranoia. [[/footnote]] concluding with massive organ failure and death. Afterwards, all non-skeletal body mass converts into petroleum during decomposition. Despite a 100% fatality rate, standard antiviral precautions are successful in preventing infection from one individual to another. 

In plants, infection increases photosynthetic efficiency, as the black pigment shift allows for more complete light absorption, and alteration of the stomata, resulting initially in improved heat release and increased intake of CO2. However, each infected plant also releases trace amounts of a pheromone during CO2 intake. Sufficient saturation[[footnote]] This has been determined to be reached at roughly one hectare (2.47 acres) of infected woodland. [[/footnote]] causes the immediate closure of stomata and subsequent inability to release heat in all infected plants. 

Infected trees inevitably ignite and set fire to surrounding infected flora. Liquefied remains of fauna ensure high quantities of flammable gas and surface accelerant, leading to rapid expansion of the burn area through infected territory. The final stage of the burn cycle is a firestorm, resulting in aerial dispersal of particulate and fungal spores over twice the original area, as the air currents caused by the conflagration spread the spores across progressively larger expanses of woodland.

It should be noted that the rate of expansion per burn cycle would completely consume the largest forests on Earth within one year while sending enough particulate and spore matter into the stratosphere and troposphere to simultaneously threaten the planet with both global exposure to SCP-1462, and nuclear winter[[footnote]] While a misnomer, nuclear winter is caused by particulate matter sent airborne by nuclear firestorms. The end result here is identical. [[/footnote]].

> **//Foundation Analysis**- Logs cease after 04/21/2013. Evidence suggests massive personnel losses on 04/24/2013. Current theory stands that trees surrounding complex underwent a burn cycle on 04/26/2013 after accidental exposure to fungal spores following clean-up of peach tree burn cycle. Unlikelihood of a full hectare of peach trees used for testing suggests that SCP-1462 is extremely adaptable, and since initial events has allowed for greater expansion prior to burn periods. Further investigation of facility responsible for SCP-1462 hindered by condition of original facility.//
