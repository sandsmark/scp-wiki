This is the hub for fiction taking place in the SCP Universe. Any tales, so long as they involve some sort of SCP (including ones not on the main list), the Foundation, one of the other organizations, or the larger Foundation universe, are at home here.

The only rules for this section are that if you're going to use someone else's SCP, try and get permission first, but if that's not possible (i.e. the author is either unknown, or not around any more) feel free to use it, but try and stick to the spirit of the SCP. This also applies to SCP researchers, agents, etc. If you're not sure, ask in [[[chat-guide|the chat]]].

When placing the story, put it in alphabetically. If it has multiple chapters, nest them inside the main link. If it's just a oneshot, just do it regularly. If you wish, you can add your name alphabetically to the list of authors. Also, if the story contains themes of an adult nature, put a warning on the front. Just in case.

Remember, the stuff you write doesn't have to be canon to the rest of the site. There is no canon.
