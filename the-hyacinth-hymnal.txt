    Daffodils yellow and hyacinths blue
    Good Lord, good Lord, I’m coming home to you
    Balance me, fellow, with innocence true
    Good Lord, good Lord, I’m coming home to you

    It has not been an easy ride, born on the shore
    Good Lord, good Lord, show me that white door
    And if my spirit doth misguide, I am not done for
    Good Lord, good Lord, show me that white door

    Daffodils yellow and hyacinths blue
    Good Lord, good Lord, I’m coming home to you
    Balance me, fellow, with innocence true
    Good Lord, good Lord, I’m coming home to you

++ Excerpt 2 - "Lord, You Have Come To The Lakeshore" (0:58–2:20)

//Takes many lines from a hymn by Cesareo Gabarain, though the music shares no resemblance.//

[[code]]
A fiddle is played. POI-35233 sings.

POI-35233:
    Lord, you have come to the lakeshore
    Looking neither for wealthy nor wise ones
    You only asked me to follow humbly.

    [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

    Lord, with your eyes you have searched me,
    Kindly smiling, have spoken my name
    Now my boat's left on the shoreline behind me;
    By your side I will seek other seas

    You know so well my possessions
    My boat carries no gold and no weapons
    But nets and fishes -- my daily labor
    You need my hands, full of caring

    Through my labors to give others rest,
    And constant love that keeps on loving
    You, who have fished other oceans
    Ever longed-for by souls who are waiting

    My loving friend, as thus you call me.

++ Excerpt 3 - Reading of Micah 7:1-7 (2:22–3:22)

[[code]]
A fiddle is played. POI-35233 speaks.

POI-35233:
    Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer
    fruits, as the grapegleanings of the vintage: there is no
    cluster to eat: my soul desired the firstripe fruit.

    The good man is perished out of the earth: and there is none
    upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt
    every man his brother with a net.

    That they may do evil with both hands earnestly, the prince
    asketh, and the judge asketh for a reward; and the great man,
    he uttereth his mischievous desire: so they wrap it up.

    The best of them is as a brier: the most upright is sharper
    than a thorn hedge: the day of thy watchmen and thy visitation
    cometh; now shall be their perplexity.

    Trust ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide:
    keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom.

    For the son dishonoureth the father, the daughter riseth up
    against her mother, the daughter in law against her mother in
    law; a man's enemies are the men of his own house.

    Therefore I will look unto the Lᴏʀᴅ; I will wait for the God
    of my salvation: my God will hear me.

++ Excerpt 4 - "Here And Heaven" (3:30–4:59)

//Written by bluegrass artist Chris Thile in 2011.//

[[code]]
A banjo is played. POI-35233 and UNKNOWN sing.

POI-35233 and UNKNOWN:
    With a hammer and nails and a fear of failure we
    are building a shed
    Between here and heaven between the wait and the
    wedding for as long as we both shall be dead
    to the world beyond the boys and the girls trying
    to keep us calm
    We can practice our lines 'til we're deaf and blind
    to ourselves to each other where it's

    Fall not winter spring not summer cool not cold
    And it's warm not hot have we all forgotten that
    we're getting old

    With an arrow and bow and some seeds left to sow
    we are staking our claim
    On ground so fertile we forget who we've hurt along
    the way and reach out for a strange hand
    to hold someone strong but not bold enough to
    tear down the wall
    'Cause we ain't lost enough to find the stars ain't
    crossed why align them why fall hard
    not soft into

    Fall not winter spring not summer cool not cold
    Where it's warm not hot has everyone forgotten that
    we're getting old

++ Excerpt 5 - Reading of Psalm 40 (5:02–6:58)

[[code]]
POI-35233 speaks. Periodic gunshots are heard.

POI-35233:
    I waited patiently for the Lord; and he inclined unto me, and
    heard my cry.

    He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry
    clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings.

    And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our
    God: many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the Lord.

    Blessed is that man that maketh the Lord his trust, and
    respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.

    Many, O Lord my God, are thy wonderful works which thou hast
    done, and thy thoughts which are to us-ward: they cannot be
    reckoned up in order unto thee: if I would declare and speak
    of them, they are more than can be numbered.

    Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast
    thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou no
    required.

    Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is
    written of me,

    I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my
    heart.

    I have preached righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I
    have not refrained my lips, O Lord, thou knowest.

    I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have
    declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not
    concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great
    congregation.

    Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O Lord: let thy
    lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me.

    For innumerable evils have compassed me about: mine iniquities
    have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up;
    they are more than the hairs of mine head: therefore my heart
    faileth me.

    Be pleased, O Lord, to deliver me: O Lord, make haste to help
    me.

    Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my
    soul to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to
    shame that wish me evil.

    Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto
    me,

POI-35233 pauses. Heavy breathing is heard.

    Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let
    such as love thy salvation say continually, The Lord be
    magnified.

    But I am poor and needy; yet the Lord thinketh upon me: thou
    art my help and my deliverer; make no tarrying, O my God.

The sound of a gun being loaded. Broadcast ends.[[/code]]
