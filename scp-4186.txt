**Item #:** SCP-4186

**Object Class:** Neutralized (Formerly Keter)

**Archived Containment Procedures:** SCP-4186 is to be monitored for unpredicted movement by Foundation climatologists. During a GLADYS event, SCP-4186-1 instances must all be collected.

**Description:** SCP-4186 was a dark gray cumulonimbus cloud approximately 0.5 kilometers in length, and 500 height in width. Despite dry conditions in the areas it hovered over, SCP-4186 would not dissipate. Its path remained circular around the U.S. Mid-northwest. SCP-4186 always appeared dark gray, as if it were precipitating, even after an GLADYS event. 

GLADYS events consisted of SCP-4186 expelling packages everyday at 3:21 p.m. The packages, hereafter SCP-4186-1, appeared consistent with packaging delivered by Amazon, Inc, a US-based e-commerce business. SCP-4186-1 instances contained letters and items delivered to and from "506 Preston Street, Tillamook, Michigan, USA." 

After the events of 2001/12/30, SCP-4186 is considered Neutralized.
