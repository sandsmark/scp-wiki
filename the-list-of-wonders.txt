The Beller walked through the Waste, leaving no tracks.

He was a tall, lanky man with black hair and beady eyes.  He wore gray clothing, with a small tongueless bell at his throat, and a ring with the sign of York, the patron saint of thieves and rogues.

Beller wasn't his real name, of course, but he made it a habit never to tell anyone his real name.  //He// said it was because his people were afraid to give out their real names.  Most people assumed he was wanted under the name he was born with.  He was certainly wanted enough under his new one (and unwanted, in some places).

He knew the Ways, though.  If anyone could get you from one city to another, it was him (extra if he'd been outcast by the locals).  If you wanted a relic from the old places, he knew where you could buy it, or, if the price was right, he'd fetch you one himself.

The waterskin at his side was empty.  Water was plentiful in the Waste, and it was one less thing to weigh him down.  The real problem was food.  Nothing grew in the waste.  There were occasional birds and animals crossing the damp sands, but no trees or grasses of any sort.

The Beller knew the Waste well.  He'd used its trackless spaces to escape pursuit many times.  Today, however, he was looking for someone else.

In the distance, a rocky promontory poked up over the dunes like the back of a beetle.  He'd spotted it the day before, and he would reach it in a few more hours.

"Ho!  Beller!" a voice called out.

The Beller tensed, reaching for his sword.  He relaxed after he spotted a man atop a dune, wearing thick leather robes.  "Benadam!  I've come to visit you."

The man began walking down the dune to the Beller.  He smiled, his blue eyes almost seeming to shine from under the leather skullcap worn low over his forehead.  "I thought as much.  I spotted you yesterday.  What brings you here?"

"I've found some writings, and I want you to tell me what they mean," the Beller said.  He held up the box with the handle he'd found.  He'd found it across the world, after he'd tried to rob a wizard's home, and fell victim to an enchanted pool.

"A briefcase full of secrets?" Benadam said.  "I'm surprised it's intact.  Well, follow me.  I've built up a small camp, and we can speak more there."

This was how it always went with Benadam.  He always met Beller within a day of the rocks, with a campsite set up.  The Beller had never been to the rocks themselves, and he didn't know anyone who had.

Benadam looked to be in his middle years, but he'd been in the Waste as long as the Beller had heard.  Some said he was as old as the Waste itself.  He certainly knew enough of the lost days.

The hermit led him up the dune and to a small tent, made from leather and with the bones of some great beast for supports.  There was a small metal contraption with fire rising from it.

"So, let's look at your case," the hermit said, reaching for the case with his leather gloves.  He opened the clasp with hardly a glance, though it had taken the Beller several minutes to figure out.  He pulled out the papers, yellow and brittle, and began to read them over.  He sucked in his breath, and asked, "Where did you find this?"

"In a fortress built into a mountain, far across the sea," the Beller said.  "One of the fortresses of the Old Order."  He could hardly keep the excitement from his voice.  "There were other relics there, but this was the only thing I could carry easily."

"How did you get across the sea?" Benadam asked.  "Never mind.  Do you realize what you have?"

"Secrets," the Beller said, smiling.  The hermit's reaction told him the papers were important.

"You could say that," Benadam said, slowing nodding.  "This is a list of... of Wonders, I suppose you could say, and the locations of the Ceitus."

"Including the Home Ceitu?" the Beller asked, hungrily.

Benadam straightened suddenly.  "Beller, no!  You don't know what's in there.  It was abandoned for a reason."

"I'm not afraid.  I've been in Ceitus before."  The Beller puffed up his narrow chest.

"Not like this one.  I won't let you do it," Benadam said.

"Don't try to stop me, old man.  Just tell me where the site is!"  The Beller grabbed the hermit's wrist.  It felt hard and thin under the sleeve, as though there were nothing there but bone.

Benadam did not move, and his expression never changed, but something changed in him, as though he had suddenly grown larger.  The hairs on the back of the Beller's neck rose.  There was as sense of power in the air, as though lightning were about to strike.  "Will you strike me?" the hermit asked.

The Beller took his hand from Benadam, and he looked away, embarrassed despite himself.

"Now, I'm going to put an end to this nonsense," Benadam said.  He put the papers over the fire, and they caught at once.  "You should thank me.  I've saved you from yourself, you know."

Resentment boiled up inside of the Beller.  He hated being made a fool of, and he couldn't resist leaving one last gloating note.  "You haven't changed anything," he said.

"What do you mean?" Benadam asked, suspicious.

"Do you think I would make this journey with only the original set of papers?  As fragile as they were?  I've had time to make a dozen sets, and I've hidden them all."  In truth, he'd only taken the time to make one copy, and it was in his bag.  But Benadam didn't know that.

"Beller!  You can't do this!  I won't let you!"  Benadam rose, and for a moment, the Beller thought he might attack.

"You won't stop me," the Beller said with a bravado he didn't feel.  "You're no murderer."

Benadam stared at him for a long moment, and then, to the Beller's surprise, he burst out laughing.  "Oh, Beller, if you only knew.  No, I won't kill you, but not for the reasons you think.  Go on, then.  I cannot stop you.  But I don't know how you expect to follow the notes when you cannot read them."

"I'll find another who knows the old language," the Beller said.

"There's no one else," Benadam said.  "I'm the only one who still remembers it."

"Not true," the Beller said.  "There's one other.  And he's not hard to find."

"Who--Oh, Beller.  You don't mean to go South, do you?"  Benadam's eyes turned to pity.

"If you will not help me, then I have no choice," the Beller said.  "I'd go to Abirt himself if he offered me the home Ceitu."

Benadam only shook his head.  "It's not death you should be afraid of in the Everman's hands."
