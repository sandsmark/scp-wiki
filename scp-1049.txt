**Item #:** SCP-XXX

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-xxx is kept in a 1 x 1 x 3m aviary. Other than a perch 2m above ground, feeder, and water container, no foreign objects are permitted in SCP-xxx's enclosure. SCP-xxx is to be kept tethered to the perch at all times. If entry to SCP-xxx's enclosure is required, protective clothing must be worn and time inside in the enclosure must be kept to a minimum. 

SCP-xxx is to be fed a diet consisting mostly of beetles, crickets and locusts. Small bats or mice may also be offered once per week. Personnel must not enter SCP-xxx's enclosure to feed it; the feeder attached to the aviary allows for food to be offered from outside.

**Description:** SCP-xxx is an adult male Black and White Owl (//Strix nigrolineata//). It is physically identical to any other member of its species save for its eyes, which are a reddish pink.
