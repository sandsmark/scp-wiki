Google recently added a change for Chrome/Chromium which blocks all third-party cookies by default. The aim is to minimize user tracking across different sites, which is good. Unfortunately because Wikidot only reports cookies (used to determine if a user is signed in) for sites ending in "{{wikidot.com}}" this means wikis with custom domains (e.g. {{scp-wiki.net}} and {{kontainer.djkakt.us}}) don't recognize that you're logged in.

**The easiest workaround is to use http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/ instead** of http://www.scp-wiki.net/.

However it is possible to adjust Chrome settings so we can enjoy the privacy benefits and log into Wikidot sites.

[[collapsible show="Desktop Instructions" hide="Desktop Instructions" hideLocation="both"]]
[[div class="desktop"]]

Sign-in like you normally do. If the cookies are being blocked you won't appear as signed in.

In the top-right of your address bar click the "cookie" icon to get the menu, then click "Manage".

If your version of Chrome does not have this shortcut, you can access the cookie settings menu by going to {{chrome://settings/}} >> Advanced >> Privacy and Security >> Site Settings >> Cookies and site data. Instead of tabs like below you will be able to directly add domains to allow.

Once you get to the list of cookies, click on the blocked tab.

From there you will see the domains for Wikidot, which you will need to set to "Allow".

Hit "Done" and refresh the page. You should now be recognized as logged in!
[[/div]]
[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show="Mobile Instructions" hide="Mobile Instructions" hideLocation="both"]]
[[div class="mobile"]]

Sign-in like you normally do. If the cookies are being blocked you won't appear as signed in.

Open up the settings from the sidebar menu.

[[=image mobile-1.png]]

From there scroll down and open "Site settings".

[[=image mobile-2.png]]

Then tap on "Cookies".

[[=image mobile-3.png]]

First, ensure that cookies are enabled.

Then tap to add site exceptions for Wikidot, specifically "{{wikidot.com}}" and "{{www.wikidot.com}}".

[[=image mobile-4.png]]

Once they are both present, tap each one to enter its site-specific settings.

[[=image mobile-5.png]]

Set cookies to "Allow", then go back once to return to the menu.

[[=image mobile-6.png]]

When properly set, the settings page should appear as below.

Note: the presence or absence of other sites other than "{{wikidot.com}}" and "{{www.wikidot.com}}" is irrelevant.

[[=image mobile-7.png]]

Exit from the settings menu and refresh the page. You should now be recognized as logged in!
