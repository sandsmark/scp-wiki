Google recently added a change for Chrome/Chromium which blocks all third-party cookies by default. The aim is to minimize user tracking across different sites, which is good. Unfortunately because Wikidot only reports cookies (used to determine if a user is signed in) for sites ending in "{{wikidot.com}}" this means wikis with custom domains (e.g. {{scp-wiki.net}} and {{kontainer.djkakt.us}}) don't recognize that you're logged in.

**The easiest workaround is to use http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/ instead** of http://www.scp-wiki.net/.

However it is possible to adjust Chrome settings so we can enjoy the privacy benefits and log into Wikidot sites.

[[collapsible show="Desktop Instructions" hide="Desktop Instructions" hideLocation="both"]]
[[div class="desktop"]]

Sign-in like you normally do. If the cookies are being blocked you won't appear as signed in.

In the top-right of your address bar click the "cookie" icon to get the menu, then click "Manage".

Once you get to the list of cookies, click on the blocked tab.

[[=image desktop-2.png]]

From there you will see the domains for Wikidot, which you will need to set to "Allow".

[[=image desktop-3.png]]

Hit "Done" and refresh the page. You should now be recognized as logged in!

[[collapsible show="Mobile Instructions" hide="Mobile Instructions" hideLocation="both"]]
[[div class="mobile"]]

Sign-in like you normally do. If the cookies are being blocked you won't appear as signed in.

Open up the settings from the sidebar menu.

[[=image mobile-1.png]]

From there scroll down and open "Site settings".

[[=image mobile-2.png]]

Then tap on "Cookies".

[[=image mobile-3.png]]

First, ensure that cookies are enabled.

Then tap to add site exceptions for Wikidot, specifically "{{wikidot.com}}" and "{{www.wikidot.com}}".

[[=image mobile-4.png]]

Once they are both present, tap each one to enter its site-specific settings.

[[=image mobile-5.png]]

Set cookies to "Allow", then go back once to return to the menu.

[[=image mobile-6.png]]

When properly set, the settings page should appear as below.

Note: the presence or absence of other sites other than "{{wikidot.com}}" and "{{www.wikidot.com}}" is irrelevant.

[[=image mobile-7.png]]

Exit from the settings menu and refresh the page. You should now be recognized as logged in!
