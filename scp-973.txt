**Item #:** 973

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-973’s nature precludes it from full containment within the Foundation. Due to the danger it presents, the 60 kilometer stretch of US Route ██ it is known to manifest on is to be under satellite surveillance at all times. Any vehicles attempting to travel the designated section of highway between 22:00 and 04:30 are to be diverted to the detours at exits ███ and ███ by Foundation personnel. Trespassers are to be forcibly arrested and detained if the need arises.

**Description:** SCP-973 consists of two entities. SCP-973-1 is a police cruiser, resembling those used by ███████ state troopers in the early 1970s. The vehicle appears to be in an advanced state of disrepair: eyewitness accounts have consistently mentioned large dents in the doors and hood, a heavily cracked windshield, heavy rusting, and a loose rear bumper secured with duct tape. 

SCP-973-2 is reported as a Caucasian male in his late forties, wearing a ███████ state trooper uniform dating from the same time period as SCP-973-1. Subject is described as balding, slightly overweight, and having a handlebar mustache.

SCP-973 will manifest at night when another vehicle enters the designated territory. It will appear approximately .4 km behind the target vehicle, and will chase down the target at high speed with the siren and flashers on. This is accompanied by a looping message played on the target’s radio, consisting of the phrase “Run, [EXPLETIVE DELETED]”. In ██% of cases, the target will flee with SCP-973 in pursuit and will be overtaken in 1-6 minutes. At this point, [DATA EXPUNGED].

The remains of thirty-four individuals and nineteen vehicles have been found within 6.4 km of the affected roadway. The range of damage done to bodies includes evisceration, rape, [DATA EXPUNGED], and three cases where the body had been damaged by the impact to the point that visual identification was impossible. Five survivors are within Foundation custody, all suffering from varying degrees of mental trauma. The recovered vehicles showcase heavy impact damage, both environmental and inflicted, and severe burn damage to the interior.

**Incident Report 973-KO:** This is a personal interview with Agent ████████, who witnessed firsthand the failed attempt to terminate SCP-973 in August of 20██.

> **Dr. ██████:** All right then, Agent ████████. Could you please begin with what your original plan was? 
> **Agent ████████:** Uh, yeah. Sure. The original plan was that we’d close off the highway, ride out during the day and set up a roadblock. We had twenty-five agents there, a couple SUV mounted miniguns, and a blockade made of concrete dividers and sandbags. We also had some remote landmines hooked up, just in case. Had the whole thing set up by, say, five-thirty that evening.
> **Dr. ██████:** And the plan was to lure 973 with a remotely controlled car, correct?
> **Agent ████████:** Yup. That part actually worked. 973 manifested behind the decoy and followed  behind, just as usual. When it got to a good spot, we had the decoy swerve off the road and detonated  the mines.
> **Dr. ██████:** And then what happened?
> **Agent ████████:** 973 just did a complete flip in the air and landed on its tires like nothing happened.  Then it came right for us, and it was on fire.
> **Dr. ██████:** Fire, Agent ████████?
> **Agent ████████:** The whole thing was spewing fire and smoke. I think we hit that gas tank or  something. God only knows how it was still running. The landmines damaged it, but not like how it would  have on any normal car. So, the thing gets within fifty feet of us, jams on the brakes, skids to the side,  and 973-2 jumps right out at us.
> **Dr. ██████:** You said in your after-action report that 973-2 looked different from other eyewitness  accounts. Could you explain?
> **Agent ████████:** I can’t really say. He just looked…different. His eyes were red, I remember that, and his mouth was just this black hole. No teeth, no tongue, just a hole. I was too busy shooting at him to get a better look than that.
> **Dr. ██████:** And what was the outcome?
> **Agent ████████:** We lost fourteen agents and one of the SUVs, if that’s what you mean. Six to him,  eight to the car.
> **Dr. ██████:** The car?
> **Agent ████████:** After 973-2 jumped out, the car started driving around on its own, belching all this  smoke and brimstone. Ran over eight of our guys. Somebody managed to blow the front passenger door off with a grenade launcher, and we were able to take out one of the tires, but it just kept going. As for  973-2, we must have shot him thirty times, and that was before we got him with the minigun. He looked  like a pile of hamburger after that, with some scraps of khaki uniform stuck on. There were bloody chunks all over the place. Then everything was over…he just jumped back in 973-1 and drove right through the barricade like nothing happened.
> **Dr. ██████:** According to the file, the next sighting of SCP-973 was nine days after the termination  attempt.
> **Agent ███████:** Yeah…I vote we bring a tank next time.

**Addendum-1:** Destroying the roadway affected by SCP-973 has proven ineffective. The demolition of part of State Route ██ in 1983 led to SCP-973 relocating itself to its current position.

**Addendum-2:** SCP-973’s area of effect seems to be expanding, as does the window of time that manifestations occur. Security protocols have been adapted to this.
