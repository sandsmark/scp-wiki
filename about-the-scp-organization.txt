title:About The Scp Organization
**Welcome**
SCP artifacts pose a significant threat to global security. Various agencies from around the world operate to maintain human independence from extra-terrestrial, extra-dimensional, and extra-universal threat. In the past humankind has been at the whim of these bizarre artifacts and similar phenomena, but we have now reached a point in history where we can begin to control and contain these defiances of natural law.

You are now working for the SCP Foundation. You have no need to understand how or why we operate. What you do need to understand is how vital your mission is.

**Our Goals**
* Observe preternatural phenomena and develop new theories of science based on their observable behavior.
* Contain potentially dangerous phenomena
* Develop safety procedures for dealing with all future phenomena
* Observe, detain, and destroy any one or any thing preventing us from accomplishing the above-stated goals.

**SCP Reports**
One of the most essential functions of the Foundation is to compile and consolidate information about artifacts in our possession, or observed outside of our scope of influence.

Special Containment Procedures are required for each and every observed phenomena. It is amongst your top priorities to assist the higher-level officers in the research required for the composition of these reports. These reports are the foundation of the Foundation.

Also, it is imperative that these documents never leak to the public. If they are verified and traced back to the source by a party not privy to this information, it could spell disaster for the Foundation and all SCP artifacts currently under our control.

**Note from General Bowe**
My office and commission have determined that in the event of an intelligence leak the best way to handle it would be to utilize the dissemination method and discredit the initial leak by compiling poorly-written works of fiction in the same vein. When our addendums are obviously false, the intelligence link will be dismissed as well.

**Note from Dr. ███████**
It is worth noting that in spite of General Bowe's extensive access to our computer records, the General does not dictate Foundation policy.
