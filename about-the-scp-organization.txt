title:About The Scp Organization
Mankind in its present state has been around for a quarter of a million years, yet only the last 4,000 have been of any significance.  So, what did we do for nearly 250,000 years?  We huddled in caves and around small fires, fearful of the things that we didn't understand.  It was more than explaining why the sun came up, it was the mystery of enormous birds with heads of men, and rocks that came to life.  So we called them 'gods' and 'demons,' and begged them to spare us and prayed for salvation.

In time, their numbers dwindled and our numbers rose.  The world began to make more sense when there were less things to fear.  Yet, the unexplained can never truly go away, as if the universe demands the absurd and impossible.

Mankind must not go back to hiding in fear.  No one else will protect us, we must stand up for ourselves.  
While the rest of mankind dwell in the light, we must stand in the darkness to combat it, contain it, and shield it from the eyes of the public, so that others may live in a sane, normal world.

We secure. We contain. We protect.

+ The Organization


Clandestine and worldwide, The SCP Organization operates beyond jurisdiction, empowered and entrusted by every major world government with the task of containing 'items which jeopardize normalcy.'

Many of these 'items' pose both a physical danger to people and a psychological mistrust in worldly affairs, their personal beliefs, and an interruption to daily life.
* //exempli gratia//   - the average individual might be quite troubled by the existence of [[[SCP-126]]], believing there could be many like her present at any time.
* //exempli gratia//   - daunted by the fact that mankind is threaten by [[[SCP-008]]] or [[[SCP-1007]]]
* //exempli gratia//   - the likelihood that many people would submit to or even worship subjects such as [[[SCP-076]]] or [[[SCP-169]]]
