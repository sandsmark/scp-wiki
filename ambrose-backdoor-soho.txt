# **Scarlet Calamari** -- The servitor beasts of the King of [[[Dust and Blood]]], stuffed with finely seasoned breadcrumbs in a creamy tomato sauce. Wild caught; each serving is another beast out of the seas!
# **Olney Corporate Crostini** -- Roasted pork belly braised in a blood orange sauce and garnished with pickled red onions, served on crostini. Locally sourced from the stress-free demon swine that eternally torment the executives of Olney Ironworks at their corporate headquarters.
# **Margherita à la Lindholm** -- Sicilian pizza made with buffalo mozarella and a creamy tomato sauce, topped with out-of-this-world fresh tomatoes and basil, bred by reclusive parabotanist Stella Lindholm. Let the world melt around you with each taste.

# **Weilstedt Matzfaux-Ball Soup** -- A unique, distinctly Nalkan take on an Ashkenazi classic. You won't believe you're eating Weilstedten meat moss until your flesh rejuvenates right before your eyes. Not recommended for pregnant woman and cancer survivors, excepting experienced fleshcrafters.
# **Manhattan Shoggoth Chowder[[footnote]] Disclaimer: as the shoggoth our meat is sourced from remains alive, this meal is in violation of the 7th Noahide Law. [[/footnote]]** -- The squirming, fascinating meat of a shoggoth in a rich tomato broth. Comes with seasoned crackers; watch your meal stuff itself before your very eyes!
# **The Perfect Waldorf** -- Apples and grapes from the centennial trees of Upstate New York's [[[SCP-4000|nameless forests]]], mayonnaise sourced from the eggs of platonic chickens, walnuts annually self-trimmed from living trees dedicated to self-perfection: anything to elevate the hidden gem of NYC to heights of perfection.

# **Delmonico Steak** -- Think you've had a Delmonico? Think again. Our Delmonico has been scientifically proven to not only taste better than, but //be more// of a Delmonico than those served at the Delmonico establishments of old. Proof available upon request.
# **Parmigiana Without Equal[[footnote]] Disclaimer: this item physically should not exist. Order with caution. [[/footnote]]:** Eggplant parmigiana stuffed with chicken parmigiana, forever: it's stuffed all the way down.

# **{{cheese}}cake** -- Focus on the cake, and don't worry about the {{cheese}}. Some things were never meant to be known by the sapient. Gluten-free.
# **Black and White Macaroons** -- A decadent assortment of dual-flavored macaroons, representing a variety of chocolates and vanillas from across time and space. Savor each bite; who knows when this shifting tides of the here and now will force us to change the recipe?
# **Golden Apple Crumble** -- There's nothing supernatural about these golden apples, but double-blind tests suggest even the gods can't tell the difference. Proof available upon request.

> ★★★★☆
>
> [[span style="color: #2116e5; font-family: 'Ruluko'; font-size: 1.15em; font-weight: bold;"]]Ambrose, as a brand, is particularly infamous for relying upon gimmicks in pursuit of customers. It's not particularly surprising; this far behind the veil, it's hard to surprise potential consumers. Harder still to surprise a representative of Marshall Carter & Dark, though I'm pleased to say I was pleasantly surprised with the novelty displayed within.
>
> In accordance to my strict deiphage diet, the dishes that I ordered were the Scarlet Calamari, the Manhattan Shoggoth Chowder, the Primavera of the Old Gods, the {{cheese}}cake, and the Golden Orange Cider. I'm pleased to report that not only was each course beautifully prepared, but that the establishment avoided falling to the shortcomings of a great many older deiphagy establishments.
>
> I found the general gallery to be interesting enough, being a good mix of artistic medium and style. Of the selection, most would fit right at home in the den of a savvy collector. My only complaint was that, compared to the Violet Gallery, the main floor felt somewhat thematically haphazard.
>
> My biggest complaint largely regards the opening night music show. While I suppose a representative of Marshall Carter & Dark would be the last woman one expects to cry for artistic integrity, inviting an anticapitalist art collective to such a naked display of conspicuous consumption was predictably disastrous, no matter how much one hid it underneath a veneer of "performance art". House of Spades and It's Free Jazz! in particular (groups which I've made my distaste for //quite// clear) worked rather hard to subvert the establishment ambiance.
>
> If not for Luna Zapata's hauntingly beautiful violin, I'd have written off the experience and told you, the reader, not to go. I suppose, however, that some art is just not for me.
>
> As an aside: the building appears to be haunted, which is always a plus. Coming off of Mrs. Zapata's marvelous rendition of the Devil's Trill, I witnessed a weeping woman disappearing into a wall.[[/span]]

I really don't expect much more from Ambrose than cheap gimmicks pandering to the lowest common regional denominator, but if there's one thing I can say about the food, is that it's nearly always good in spite of such.

To get into the art scene, not as an artist but as a man who goes to art galleries. I want to have fun, you know? Not be bombarded with performative woke nonsense, spearheaded by some hack who thinks she's clever.
>
> I counted about two times where a woman with a violin would approach me, glare sternly in my direction, and play a(n admittedly rather nice) solo before storming off. Afterwords, I would be accosted by a series of (admittedly rather convincing) actors playing the role of... I don't know, ghosts of Christmas? All "please don't turn off my heat" this and "give me two more weeks" that, some naked attempt to tug at heartstrings. If I wanted to feel bad about dead poor people, I'd have seen the all-revenant showing of Rent across the street.
