Here's some random thoughts on skips and tales I've done; I've actually forgotten that some of the ones on the list are mine.

+ S & C Plastics
[[collapsible show="As a whole" hide="Close"]]

In the summer of 2012, Disney's //Gravity Falls// started airing its first season. I fell in love with the show the instant I saw it on the screen, and when I found out about the original idea for the S & C Plastics canon, I decided that I wanted in.

As providence would have it, Djoric [http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-573622 made a forum post] about a new canon project he was making. In his words:

> Basically, the goal of this project is to give a stable setting for some slice of life stories with a bunch of minor researchers. These stories will end up being set in Site 87 (otherwise known as S & C Plastics), a Foundation facility located in a currently nameless American small town (similar to Gravity Falls, Twin Peaks, [Undisclosed], or Greenvale). You know, places where weird shit happens on a regular basis. This, and anything that is in the tale I posted this morning ([[[Friday]]]) is really all there is to it at the moment. I'll be adding some more tales to it in the future, but I have no plans for any overarching plots.

On top of this, the wiki handed me fuel to the fire with the 2012 Halloween contest. I decided that I would use this as an opportunity to write for S & C Plastics, and I kind of went mad with it from there.

Originally, the town that S & C Plastics took place in was just called Backwoods, and it was unknown what state it was even in. Djoric also gave this suggestion in the thread when I asked him about names for the town:

> Nothing official yet.
> 
> I'm thinking that everyone has their own pet name for it: "Backwoods", "this town", "Back-ass a' Nowhere."
> 
> Or something really bizarre. Like **Slothspit.**

Slothspit became Sloth Spit, which became Sloth's Pit. I pretty much made up the entire backstory in a week. Basically, from 1869 to 1890, the town was a quaint lumber town in Wisconsin, founded by Jackson Sloth. Then a sinkhole ate his house- this is the titular pit. Since then, the town has become a hotbed of anomalous activity. I've had a few weird headcanons about the town that have gone nowhere fast.

There are a couple of one concrete details I have about it: in 1976, the Foundation decided to raid the town, specifically Camp Krakkow, a summer camp for all the children in town. They had gotten wind of an anomaly which manifested as a giant, angry-looking bear, and fearing for the safety of those within the camp, they took away the totem pole which acted as the anchor for the bear.

Problem is: the Foundation didn't know what they were meddling in. The camp was haunted, for lack of a better term, by entities that manifested from the nightmares of children, and there were a lot of them; a week at camp away from your parents is pretty scary for a little kid. The bear was a guardian spirit for the land, and without its presence, the nightmares tore up the entire camp.

Site-87 was established, originally, to monitor the former site of Camp Krakkoww, to make sure that something like this never happened again. In the process, they found that the anomalous activity rating in this town was sky high. They expanded the site, its staff pool, and its various departments, and today, we have the Site 87 we all know and are ambivalent about. 

Oh, and don't talk about the Christmas of 2008. Nobody knows what happened. Nobody wants to know what happened. They say that you still dream of candy-cane fingers if you sleep on the third floor.

Also I really need to fix the hub. It looks like trash.

[[collapsible show="Early Installment Weirdness and Dead Story Arcs" hide="Close"]]

I had a lot of weird, bad, and dumb ideas when I first started writing S & C Plastics. Among them were:

* Site-87 is a place where they stick people who have defected from other organizations to monitor them.
* A story arc in which an archival assistant witnesses a murder and an infiltration attempt by an unknown organization, and is rendered mute and unable to communicate what he witnessed.
* A story arc involving the Paperboy- a creepypasta character come to life. It was a dumb, dumb idea, and I will never write it.

[[collapsible show="Site 87" hide="Close"]]

Site 87 has a unique tone compared to the rest of the Foundation. Not as bizarrely over the top as what was seen in stuff like Incident 239-B, but not as cold and clinical as most of the site. The people at Site-87 are, in the end, human beings. And human beings like expressing themselves, having friends, conversations about stupid shit that's not related to work, kicking back and watching bad movies, and a million other things.

A lot of what people consider to be the best characters on the site weren't even Foundation related, and that's because the Foundation is an inherently stifling force, something I wanted to mitigate in this canon.

And there's actually an in-universe reason for this. Circa 1982, the Foundation noticed declining morale throughout the entire organization; the suicide rate in the Foundation had spiked the previous year. So, the Ethics Committee picked a random site to start morale improvement programs. 87 was the one they chose. Prior to the implementation of the program- which included everything from turning a blind eye to romantic relationships in the site to installing an Atari 2600 in one of the the break rooms to getting better coffee- the atmosphere at 87 was ambivalent. People tolerated each other, knew their names, but they never really talked.

As it turns out, talking to each other was one of the best possible things to do. Within six months, the first annual Site 87 comedy night was established, featuring horrible jokes from everyone from the Director of Site-87 to Tyler Bailey, inventor of the Multi Universal Transit Array.

[[collapsible show="Random musings on the characters"]]

I think we've all done this: made up dumb stuff in the backstory for our characters, or details on their creation that will never see the light of day. Some of this might, but for now, I'll keep it here.

**Director Nina Weiss:** I came up with her concept from watching the excellent TV series //Fringe//; she's based, in part, off of the character of Nina Sharp, the acting director of Massive Dynamic. An older woman who still has a lot of fight left in her, and is a badass in the background. In the show, Sharp is instrumental to unravelling the conspiracy that ties the show together, even if she is receiving returns from it at the same time.

Dumb fact about her: she's actually killed another member of the Foundation before. She used to be a parapharmatologist (i.e. someone who works with anomalous drugs) and found out that someone high up was planning on selling out part of the Foundation to... someone. So, she used a poison that was undetectable, and only went off when catalyzed by a certain sound: the ringing of a phone for when they were going to make the deal to sell the Foundation out.

**Dr. Katherine Sinclair:** Probably one of my favorite characters to write. The Department of Occult Studies is the most underfunded, overlooked things in the Foundation, in part because of people like Sinclair, who try to practically apply magic. While this attitude has softened in more recent years (both in and out of universe), I like the fact that she is the only member of Occult Studies at Site 87; her partner, Montgomery Reynolds, is actually on indefinite loan to the Foundation from the GOC.

Dumb facts: One of Sinclair's first attempts at doing magic (and the one that got her noticed by the Foundation, actually) was in grad school. Details are murky, but somehow, she teleported the entire contents of her bedroom (herself included) to Site-74 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 

She has a fascination with anything anthropomorphic, but not quite human. Her psychologist has advised her to keep it out of the workplace. [[size 0%]]And no, she does not have a fursuit. //Yet.// [[/size]]


**The Bailey Family: Tyler Bailey and his sons, Tom, Tristan, and Trevor:** Djoric admitted he made up the Bailey Brothers as a joke for one tale-- [[[Multi-U 101]]]. But something about the idea of an entire family in the Foundation- two generations, at that- stuck in my mind, and I developed them a bit. These characters are still property of Djoric, so dude, if you have beef: come at me bro.

Tristan Bailey has been dating the current head of the Department of Multi-Universal Affairs, Claire Hennessy, for the last three years. Tristan insists on keeping it on the hush-hush, because of the apparent scandal he's afraid it would generate. 

Tom Bailey is currently the head of Site-1483, and is pretty much the guy in charge of Foundation-Antarctic relations. He poses a bit of a security risk, as he keeps trying to sneak off on expeditionary teams.

Trevor Bailey is probably the smartest of the triplets, having been able to read at the age of three and could do complex theoretical equations by the time he was twelve. His talents are wasted behind the desk at a diplomatic job in Site 19. He belongs in the theoretical department, exploring new methods of extra-universal travel.

Tyler Bailey has been dead since 1997-- at least, in the universe where S & C Plastics takes place.
