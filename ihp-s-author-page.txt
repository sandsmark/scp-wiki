[[tab Author Commentary]]

Here's some random thoughts on skips and tales I've done; I've actually forgotten that some of the ones on the list are mine.

+ S & C Plastics
[[collapsible show="As a whole" hide="Close"]]

In the summer of 2012, Disney's //Gravity Falls// started airing its first season. I fell in love with the show the instant I saw it on the screen, and when I found out about the original idea for the S & C Plastics canon, I decided that I wanted in.

As providence would have it, Djoric [http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-573622 made a forum post] about a new canon project he was making. In his words:

> Basically, the goal of this project is to give a stable setting for some slice of life stories with a bunch of minor researchers. These stories will end up being set in Site 87 (otherwise known as S & C Plastics), a Foundation facility located in a currently nameless American small town (similar to Gravity Falls, Twin Peaks, [Undisclosed], or Greenvale). You know, places where weird shit happens on a regular basis. This, and anything that is in the tale I posted this morning ([[[Friday]]]) is really all there is to it at the moment. I'll be adding some more tales to it in the future, but I have no plans for any overarching plots.

On top of this, the wiki handed me fuel to the fire with the 2012 Halloween contest. I decided that I would use this as an opportunity to write for S & C Plastics, and I kind of went mad with it from there.

Originally, the town that S & C Plastics took place in was just called Backwoods, and it was unknown what state it was even in. Djoric also gave this suggestion in the thread when I asked him about names for the town:

> Nothing official yet.
> 
> I'm thinking that everyone has their own pet name for it: "Backwoods", "this town", "Back-ass a' Nowhere."
> 
> Or something really bizarre. Like **Slothspit.**

Slothspit became Sloth Spit, which became Sloth's Pit. I pretty much made up the entire backstory in a week. Basically, from 1869 to 1890, the town was a quaint lumber town in Wisconsin, founded by Jackson Sloth. Then a sinkhole ate his house- this is the titular pit. Since then, the town has become a hotbed of anomalous activity. I've had a few weird headcanons about the town that have gone nowhere fast.

There are a couple of one concrete details I have about it: in 1976, the Foundation decided to raid the town, specifically Camp Krakkow, a summer camp for all the children in town. They had gotten wind of an anomaly which manifested as a giant, angry-looking bear, and fearing for the safety of those within the camp, they took away the totem pole which acted as the anchor for the bear.

Problem is: the Foundation didn't know what they were meddling in. The camp was haunted, for lack of a better term, by entities that manifested from the nightmares of children, and there were a lot of them; a week at camp away from your parents is pretty scary for a little kid. The bear was a guardian spirit for the land, and without its presence, the nightmares tore up the entire camp.

Site-87 was established, originally, to monitor the former site of Camp Krakkoww, to make sure that something like this never happened again. In the process, they found that the anomalous activity rating in this town was sky high. They expanded the site, its staff pool, and its various departments, and today, we have the Site 87 we all know and are ambivalent about. 

Oh, and don't talk about the Christmas of 2008. Nobody knows what happened. Nobody wants to know what happened. They say that you still dream of candy-cane fingers if you sleep on the third floor.

Also I really need to fix the hub. It looks like trash.

[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show="Early Installment Weirdness and Dead Story Arcs" hide="Close"]]

I had a lot of weird, bad, and dumb ideas when I first started writing S & C Plastics. Among them were:

* Site-87 is a place where they stick people who have defected from other organizations to monitor them.
* A story arc in which an archival assistant witnesses a murder and an infiltration attempt by an unknown organization, and is rendered mute and unable to communicate what he witnessed.
* A story arc involving the Paperboy- a creepypasta character come to life. It was a dumb, dumb idea, and I will never write it.

[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible show="Site 87" hide="Close"]]

Site 87 has a unique tone compared to the rest of the Foundation. Not as bizarrely over the top as what was seen in stuff like Incident 239-B, but not as cold and clinical as most of the site. The people at Site-87 are, in the end, human beings. And human beings like expressing themselves, having friends, conversations about stupid shit that's not related to work, kicking back and watching bad movies, and a million other things.

A lot of what people consider to be the best characters on the site weren't even Foundation related, and that's because the Foundation is an inherently stifling force, something I wanted to mitigate in this canon.

And there's actually an in-universe reason for this. Circa 1982, the Foundation noticed declining morale throughout the entire organization; the suicide rate in the Foundation had spiked the previous year. So, the Ethics Committee picked a random site to start morale improvement programs. 87 was the one they chose. Prior to the implementation of the program- which included everything from turning a blind eye to romantic relationships in the site to installing an Atari 2600 in one of the the break rooms to getting better coffee- the atmosphere at 87 was ambivalent. People tolerated each other, knew their names, but they never really talked.

As it turns out, talking to each other was one of the best possible things to do. Within six months, the first annual Site 87 comedy night was established, featuring horrible jokes from everyone from the Director of Site-87 to Tyler Bailey, inventor of the Multi Universal Transit Array.

[[collapsible show="Random musings on the characters"]]

I think we've all done this: made up dumb stuff in the backstory for our characters, or details on their creation that will never see the light of day. Some of this might, but for now, I'll keep it here.

**Director Nina Weiss:** I came up with her concept from watching the excellent TV series //Fringe//; she's based, in part, off of the character of Nina Sharp, the acting director of Massive Dynamic. An older woman who still has a lot of fight left in her, and is a badass in the background. In the show, Sharp is instrumental to unravelling the conspiracy that ties the show together, even if she is receiving returns from it at the same time.

Dumb fact about her: she's actually killed another member of the Foundation before. She used to be a parapharmatologist (i.e. someone who works with anomalous drugs) and found out that someone high up was planning on selling out part of the Foundation to... someone. So, she used a poison that was undetectable, and only went off when catalyzed by a certain sound: the ringing of a phone for when they were going to make the deal to sell the Foundation out.

**Dr. Katherine Sinclair:** Probably one of my favorite characters to write. The Department of Occult Studies is the most underfunded, overlooked things in the Foundation, in part because of people like Sinclair, who try to practically apply magic. While this attitude has softened in more recent years (both in and out of universe), I like the fact that she is the only member of Occult Studies at Site 87; her partner, Montgomery Reynolds, is actually on indefinite loan to the Foundation from the GOC.

I've rewritten Sinclair's backstory more times than I care to count, but here's the closest you'll get to a canon interpretation:

Dr. Katherine Jean Sinclair. Born May 1st, 1982 in a Upper Darby, PA to a mother who believed in fairies and a father who got arrested for public homosexuality, back when that was punishable. She hated her mother; she was constantly harassed at school for having a faggot dad and a mom who was nuts. At the age of 12, she tried to set fire to her bully's locker, only for the lighter she was using to fail every time. She realizes that starting the fire would make her no better than the bully, and tries her best to ignore the harassment. 

At age 14, she discovered that mom may have been more right about the anomalous world than she would like to admit. 1996, after reading one of the Earthsea novels, she's doodling about what magic in that world might look like during a biology class. After drawing a symbol for sulfur and being bumped into by the same bully- a skinny black-haired girl named Heather Hinkle. Heather's hair catches fire, along with the paper Sinclair was writing on.

She experiments, and finds out that not only is magic real, it is versatile. Being bookish as hell, she takes inspiration from her magic out of everything from Lord of the Rings to Harry Potter (which starts coming out when she turns 15) to Earthsea. She can't do much other than set fire to things, at first, but eventually starts taking inspiration from D&D. Magic, in (my view) of the Foundationverse, works differently from person to person; there are some gestures and symbols that have inherent power (the wand, the various alchemical symbols, the word "abracadabra") but it's different for everyone, and varies from school to school. In D&D terms, Sinclair specializes in evocation.

Fast forward to college. She goes to Penn State, and while there, falls in with a group of Serpent's Hand members after witnessing one of them levitate a teacher's car out of a student parking space and putting it on the roof of the Carnegie building. William, as he mononames himself, is sweet on Sinclair, and she's sweet on him. Eventually, they "bond" ahem, and he starts teaching Sinclair more about magic, and she's soon levitating cars herself, as well as being able to access a Way located in the Schwab building that leads to a part of the Wanderer's Library where copies of ancient spellbooks from different universes are kept. 

Also, through this cell, she discovered a few spells that allowed for polymorphing. She accidentally got caught polymorphed in Pittsburgh one night, drunk as a skunk, in the form of a white humanoid fox. This happens while Anthrocon is in town, and, mistaking her polymorphed form for a very convincing fursuit, she's invited into the fold.

Senior year rolls around, and William tries to perform a rite that will bring down the so-called "Jailers" hunting them down; over the last month, agents of the Foundation have infiltrated their classes, and are closing in. This rite involves sacrificing a beloved human, so William chooses Sinclair to do the rite by making her sacrifice her favorite teacher, who is a linguistics professor.

She tells Will to fuck off with his human sacrificing bullshit the best way a magic user knows how: unexpected fireball to the face. Other members of the cell try to fight back, but Sinclair just has enough raw power in her that, though she's messy, she can take them all on. In the process, she sets fire to a good part of the campus, causing a sulfur symbol to appear on the green.

The Foundation arrests her, but soon realize that she's a better asset than a prisoner. Back in the early 2000's, the Foundation's study of magic was just picking up, and as long as they had an ex-Serpent's Hand member in custody, they might as well use her. She was briefly part of Sigma-3 in the early days, but fell out after attempting to perform necromancy-- not in the 'raise the dead' sense, but in the 'tell fortune from bones' sense. 

She got shunted around, ending up in a Foundation-sponsored facility, where she gets her doctorate in, officially, anthropology, mythology, philosophy, and theology; really, that all just sums up to "you now have a doctorate in occult studies". This is around 2008, and from there, she's shunted around a little more, having a brief stint at 19, before, in 2010, she ends up at Site-87, S & C Plastics: aka "Reject Zone". It's said that, with the exception of the Bailey Triplets, you're only sent there if there's nowhere else to go. 

Still, Site-87 oversees the Nexus zone of Sloth's Pit, Wisconsin, where the paranormal is normal. She adapts quickly, at least in the cultural sense, but then finds out that she has literally the least budget of any department in the Site. It doesn't help that she hates the term "Thaumatology", because it implies that magic can be categorized under one thing, when really it's dozens of disciplines. So, for a while, she runs tests by-- and occasionally, on-- herself. Her research actually produced some fruit; she took part in a study analyzing the Salem Witch Trials, and helped find definitive proof that ergot was a major cause in the hysteria surrounding it. 

Then, 2011 rolls around, and a new challenger arrives on the scene. Montgomery Reynolds, part of an exchange program with the GOC, everything that Katherine is not-- tall, rotund, bald, wheras Sinclair is short, slim, and red-headed. Montgomery is seven years her elder, so she doesn't trust him at first, expecting him to claim seniority... but as it turns out, he's a practitioner of magical theory, not so much actually doing magic. Sinclair's struggling to learn spells outside of evocation, so she learns from Monty, while Monty learns from her how to do some rather complicated spells. They make good partners.

Their time at 87 isn't without incident; in late 2012, Katherine decides to try haruspicy-- a form of divination which involves sacrificing an animal to tell the future. She chooses a sacrificial bull from a dairy farm which is old and dying, but, because Sloth's Pit is Sloth's Pit, it doesn't go well. At all. 

See, the bull turns out to be somehow pregnant, and the thing it's pregnant with is an aberration that runs loose on the site. Two people are maimed trying to subdue it, the entire site is painted in cow's blood, and any divination that could have been gained from the sacrifice is rendered useless by the commotion. Since then, her ability to requisition live animals for sacrifices has been severely limited.

And that essentially brings one up to speed with [[[Playing With Flames]]].


**The Bailey Family: Tyler Bailey and his sons, Tom, Tristan, and Trevor:** Djoric admitted he made up the Bailey Brothers as a joke for one tale-- [[[Multi-U 101]]]. But something about the idea of an entire family in the Foundation- two generations, at that- stuck in my mind, and I developed them a bit. These characters are still property of Djoric, so dude, if you have beef: come at me bro.

Tristan Bailey has been dating the current head of the Department of Multi-Universal Affairs, Claire Hennessy, for the last three years. Tristan insists on keeping it on the hush-hush, because of the apparent scandal he's afraid it would generate. 

Tom Bailey is currently the head of Site-1483, and is pretty much the guy in charge of Foundation-Antarctic relations. He poses a bit of a security risk, as he keeps trying to sneak off on expeditionary teams.

Trevor Bailey is probably the smartest of the triplets, having been able to read at the age of three and could do complex theoretical equations by the time he was twelve. His talents are wasted behind the desk at a diplomatic job in Site 19. He belongs in the theoretical department, exploring new methods of extra-universal travel.

Tyler Bailey has been dead since 1997-- at least, in the universe where S & C Plastics takes place.

**Seren Pryce, Blake and Ruby Williams, Nicholas Ewell, and  Raymond February: MTF Sigma-10 Squad 25:**

Nicholas Ewell I made up as a one-off gag involving an agent whose punch got spiked with an anomalous compound at a Halloween party. His skin still turns yellow when he gets irate. He had a girlfriend, Jessica, who worked in Anthropology; they're amicable exes at the time being. He was the first named member of the Mobile Task Force, and started off in my mind as a security agent.

Seren Pryce's  first name from one of the deities in the video game //Runescape//-- the goddess of the elves, whose name is Welsh for "Star". She's Welsh in descent, but you'd never really know it.

Pryce was present, in the background for the events of [[[Empire of Dirt Part 2]]] and [[[Empire of Dirt Part 3]]], when Salah Zairi raided the Site to rescue his wife, Mary-Ann Lewitt. She worked as a sentry, until she got knocked out of her post by a tentacle from the Flying Spaghetti Monster and broke her leg. Before joining the Foundation, she was a member of MI-6, and worked as a sniper. As a demonstration of her skills, she shot the cigarette out of the mouth of an agent facing her directly, without harming him at all. She prefers to use a rifle, but she's a killer with a revolver.

Originally, I intended on her having an addiction to tranquilizers; this can be seen in [[[Satyr's Reign]]], briefly. I didn't know how to write it in a sensitive manner, so it's a detail that doesn't really show up.

Raymond February was part of the Choir Boys, who contained [[[SCP-1983]]] by saying prayers and shooting silver bullets. He was brought up a Baptist, and while he never told to not curse, he just felt doing so was a waste of time. One of his quirks is that he needs to suppress the need to swear.

After Choir Boys was dissolved following 1983's neutralization, he joined a task force called Stoker's Stakers-- an elite force of Vampire Hunters within the Foundation. February, as a joke, tried asking for the name to be changed to Belmont's Battalion, but nobody ever got the joke. He racked up one of the highest vampyric killcounts in Foundation history-- and then the rest of his squad got turned. He managed to save himself by throwing down a box of ammunition, forcing his turned colleagues to count it. After gunning them down, he requested a transfer.

I don't make it obvious in my writing, but he is intended to be African-American. Like a lot of things in my writing, his name came to me by combining two things in a line of sight-- a Ray Bradbury novel, and a Valentine's day card.

Blake and Ruby Williams are a pair of twins-- I seem to have a lot of families in the Foundation in my writing. Called the Wonder Twins, they're kept together because they have one of the best team dynamics observed in the Foundation. They have a form of minor telepathy that allows them to communicate at a short distance. Ruby is a bit more technical and nerdier than Blake, and is also more aggressive. Blake is willing to hear reason, and is more tactically minded. But both of them can kick ass.

**Johnathan and Harold West**

Okay, I'll be honest with you: this came about as a mistake.

Johnathan West was the first named character I came up with for S & C Plastics, but over time, that somehow got turned into "Harold". Probably because I was thinking Harold West = Herbert West? I rolled with it... and then I wanted to use West as the protagonist for my 001 proposal. I looked through my works and realized:

"Shit."

"I fucked up his name."

So, I made Johnathan and Harold two separate characters. They're brothers, but are they twins? Who knows!
