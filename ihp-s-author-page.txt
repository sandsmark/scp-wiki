title:Ihp's Author Page
+ HI.

If you're wondering why I'm shouting, it's because I'm going to do something very stupid.

As of writing, I am the second-most prolific author on the Wiki. And below (character limit permitting) I am going to attempt to write at least one paragraph about each of my works.

All of them.

I have almost 150 pages on this wiki.

(some of those are hubs and shit)

God help me.

Expect self-deprecation

Like, a lot.

This is sorted by year

Important works will be BIGGER

Let's go

+ 2012- Hello World!

[[collapsible show="Ohaiyou Sekai" hide="Good Morning World"]]

+++ [[[SCP-1071]]]- Improvement Test

I don't really remember what I was thinking with this one. I never personally took the SATs (I did the ACTs, not that it mattered-- got into college via a post-secondary enrollment program at my high school). I joined the site in late 2011, and my first attempt at an SCP was based off of my experiences playing a browser RPG game that I really should not have been playing. It flopped, and rightfully so.

+++ [[[SCP-1310]]]- Examination Room 10

I was proud of myself for snagging the number because it ended in a "10". At the time, I was undergoing a regimen of injections which were meant to improve how my body handled allergies. In order to make sure that you didn't get a reaction after injection, you had to wait in the examination room for at least half an hour. One time, it took two hours for them to get back to us (thank GOD I had my DS) and I wondered if they'd forgotten about us, which led to the creation of this SCP.

+++ [[[SCP-1658]]]- Textual Mold

I was a big fan of //Fahrenheit 451//. Still am. The idea of book burning in media fascinated me, and I wondered: how did the books //feel//? Part of the impetus for writing this was an image that I sadly can no longer use (curse you, creative commons!) that was titled "textualmicrobe.jpg".

+++ Lord Blackwood-939 Tale [DELETED]

Some time between 1658 and the next one, I wrote a tale about Lord Blackwood encountering SCP-939. It was based off of a series of Lord Blackwood tales that another user had been doing on the site at the time. And it sucked. It is one of my least-favorite pieces of writing ever.

+++ [[[SCP-1366]]]- The Rumor Mill

The fact that this is above +100 is entirely due to a suggestion made in the comments by Anaxagoras. This was originally going to be based off of Helltown in Ohio, and it kind of... spiraled out of control into an amateurishly-written work about moral panics.

+++ [[[SCP-1812]]]- Extralunar Meme

This is my first SCP to be featured on TV Tropes, on the Nightmare Fuel page for the Foundation. It also shows why I am not a scientist, because, again, this was salvaged by people in the comments telling me that gravity does not work the way I thought it did. 

++ [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/halloween-at-s-c-plastics Halloween at S&C Plastics]

This is my longest-surviving tale on the Wiki. This spiraled out of control into what is now the S & C Plastics Canon. Written for the OG Halloween Contest in 2012. I hate the way it's written, but it got me 2nd place in the contest (Damn you, DrGears, with your Treats!!!) While some characters (Johnathan West and Agent Ewell) would make frequent appearances in later works, others (Such as Margaret Reese and Dr. Matterson) would be a bit more uncommon. 

+++ [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/and-i-feel-fine And I Feel Fine]

My second S&C Plastics thing. By now, I had grown more than a little attached to the characters I had written, and decided to do a follow-up, focusing on the then-relevant 2012 apocalypse scenario. It didn't come to pass, but I'm willing to bet more than a few of us wish it did.

[[/collapsible]]

+ 2013: Getting Bigger...

[[collapsible show="Engorgio" hide="Reducto"]]

+++ [[[SCP-1438]]]- Invaders

This is nowhere near as clever as I thought it was when I was writing it. Next!

+++ [[[Issue 100]]]

Dumbass crossover fanfic with Atop the 4th Wall of all things. Next!

+++ [[[Life in the Multiverse]]]

Djoric claims that he wrote the Bailey brothers as a joke. Well, what's a good joke if you can't develop them into proper characters? I absolutely //hate// the ending of this, but I like the rest of it. Might revisit it sometime to re-do the ending.

+++ [[[SCP-1554]]]- The Damaged Fellowship

I have... odd feelings about this SCP. It was created in response to a challenge made by a user who is pretty much one of //the// original //persona non grata//s on the wiki. The fact that it's an anomalous copy of //The Fellowship of the Ring// was based off of the book in the image having the title of one of //Fellowship's// chapters as the only legible text. Said image may no longer exist by the time you read this (again, THANKS Creative Commons.)

+++ [[[Last Days at Camp]]]

Sloth's Pit had had lore forming in my head for a while before I wrote this. I wanted to explore the incident that put Sloth's Pit on the map for the Foundation.

++ [http://www.scp-wiki.net/the-s-c-plastics-hub S&C Plastics Hub]

People (by which I mean no people) have often asked the question: Is it "S&C Plastics" or "S & C Plastics"? To which I respond: I don't know.

It took a while for this to get a proper hub. The canon contest was held in early 2013, and most of the ones produced during that time have kind of fallen by the wayside, with the exceptions of Broken Masquerade and Rat's Nest. It's a pity, because there are some neat concepts-- Man Who Wasn't There was pretty neat, in my opinion.

But this became a canon after ksaid wrote something for it focusing on the inhabitants of the town, that being [[[Four Seconds, Low Pitched]]]. I am grateful to them for making S&C Plastics possible-- it might have been another six months before it happened otherwise.

++ [[[SCP-1265]]]- The Mesozoic Preserve

I like dinosaurs. This one is based off of the alleged dinosaur sightings in the Congo, and I rewrote the ending paragraphs a bit in late 2018 to better reflect modern Paleontological knowledge. It was originally going to have a nebulous anomalous organization watching over it in an attempt to de-extinct dinosaurs. Still one of my favorites.

+++ [[[Attack of the Keter Skeeters!]]]

I was originally going to make Jason Hendricks a recurring joke character. He's popped up a few more times, but never as much as I would have liked. The most notable thing that ever happened to this tale is [[*user Dmatix]] being annoyed about the fact that "Keter" isn't meant to rhyme with "Skeeter".

Also: the Keter Skeeters are real. Just not in the form you think. :3

++ [[[SCP-1972]]]- The Whore and the Cop

Eesh, if there was ever a title I regret. I like the work, but I wish we had picked a different title.

The first collaborative SCP I did, with [[*user Djoric]]. Some people love his writing, some people hate it, I personally think he's an all right guy and a pretty damn talented writer. He's also responsible for the original conception of S&C Plastics, and I wouldn't be where I am without him.

This is also the SCP with the second-most interesting fan-art I've gotten. Thanks, Kea.

++ [[[Playing With Flames]]]

Ah, Katherine Sinclair and Montgomery Reynolds. Arguably, they've become the Mary-Ann and Salah of S&C Plastics. They're certainly two of my favorite characters to write, and I took a lot of cues from [[*user HammerMaiden]]'s essay about writing anomalous characters in the Foundation, [[[Not Enough Characters|Let's Talk About Character For A Moment]]]. Plus, Magic in the Foundation is just cool.

++ [[[Local Legends]]]

Sloth's Pit began to take a concrete shape in my head starting with this tale. It's essentially the ideal Midwestern town, with all sorts of odd stories, legends, and people in it. The Hum was meant to come back in a more meaningful capacity, and this was intended to be the start of a tale series in which the Goatman fought various expies of Creepypasta characters. Thank //god// that never came to be.


+++ [[[SCP-1774]]]- The Proof's Equipment

I honestly forget I wrote this thing on a regular basis. This is so forgettable it's shameful.

+++ [[[Incident 239-Abridged]]] & [[[The Rest of the Story]]]

There was a point where the abridge version was rated higher than the original Incident 239-B Clef/Kondraki tale. I can't believe it either. I'm putting these two together because they were both attempts by me to pisstake old tales. I like the former, not so much the latter.

+++ [[[Automata Et Cetera]]]

This was written for the History contest, and if I recall, managed to place somewhat high? It was probably just because I submitted it early. This was my first serious attempt at writing for the Church of the Broken God-- it'd long been my headcanon that the CotBG and the worship of Hephaestus were somehow connected. There's a reason a fair bit of CotBG stuff is associated with Greece (at least, stuff I wrote).

+++ [[[UnScience]]]

Just a goofy tale where a bunch of researchers at Site-87 riff on bad "documentaries". The Foundation needed more Slice of Life stuff, and I was happy to oblige. Plus, it's always fun to pick on the Used To Be About History Channel.

+++ [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/lovecraft-parody-title Facts Concerning Team 15 of Chapterhouse 4 and the Black Book]

My sole contribution to Et Tam Deum Petivi. This was meant to be a lead-in to a series wherein Chapterhouse 4 was going to combat various fictional deities that were being made real through the power ironic worship, but it never came to be.

+++ [[[SCP-1863]]]- Lime Liftoff and Sarsaparilla Cream

I wish I'd gotten the science better here. Actual Cola Wars was an idea that had been in my head for a while at the time, and I'm... relatively happy with how this turned out. I had planned a sequel to this where Citrox and Carl's were doing a whole Pirates vs Ninjas thing involving a scurvy-curing soda, but that never went anywhere.

This thing beat out the Coffee Machine in the TatsTop video about Food SCPs. So that's kind of neat I guess?

+++ [[[Dance the Danse]]]

My second Halloween tale. I knew I was going to make it an annual affair (or at least try to) form this year onwards. I wanted to show off more of the Legends, and ended up introducing Sinning/Singing Jessie (who I do pair with the Goatman, don't @ me). None of the other Legends have come back since, with the exception of the Hook-Handed Man. Kind of wish that I'd written something about the Queen of the Hoop Snakes.

++ [[[SCP-2013]]]- The Reptilian Meme

Remember when the 2000 contest was won by an article that was at +186? Man that was weird. 

I am... not very happy with this SCP. If I could go back and change shit, I would. This placed 12th in the contest, at only +86. It's since doubled in ratings, but I still don't like it.

+++ [[[Send In The Clowns]]]

...I don't know what I was thinking when I was writing this, beyond "I want to do something for the lolFoundation canon". 

+++ [[[Alternate Character Interpretations]]]

An attempt to break canon on several characters. It failed. Next!

++ [[[A Very Bailey Christmas]]]

My first attempt at writing a genuinely emotional story. It seems to have landed with more people than it hasn't, which is good. The Bailey Brothers are some legitimately cool people, and they need more love. 



[[/collapsible]]

+ 2014 & 2015- Brain Fog and Horrible Writing

[[collapsible show="You Say Goodbye" hide="And I say hello"]]

These... were not good years for me. I hate pretty much everything I wrote during them. Everything I can //remember//, that is. Between a new living situation with me going to college, a massive change in medication that fucked my brain over, increasing anger issues, and just a whole host of other bullshit, it... wasn't great for me.

I'm going to just list off every work I did during this time. I can count the number of things I like from this time on one hand.

+++ [[[And Now, He Is Gone]]]

An art exchange tale featuring [[*user Dmatix]]'s [[[SCP-1295]]]. Carl is meant to be Conquest, who was replaced by Pestilence in the more modern interpretations of the Four Horsemen, for... some reason. 

+++ [[[SCP-1645]]]- the Viper and the Virus

This is one of only two rewrites I did that I'm actually writing something about. The other will be in the 2018 segment. It's... okay. I wish I'd deviated more from the original work, and the Hydra/Orochi angle is pretty weak here.

+++ [[[Stupendous Containment Procedures]]]

I'm pretty sure that if Bill Watterson found out about this, he'd drive over to my house and strangle me. And considering I live about an hour's drive from his home town of Chagrin Falls, he'd be able to do it.

+++ [[[SCP-2560]]]- Polar Opposites

I'm thankful to [[*user Kalinin]] for encouraging me to change the title-- the original was something like "Fucking Magnets". This is based off of the life of Edward Leedskalnin, a Latvian engineer who is responsible for Coral Castle near Miami. It is a //really// neat place, and fairly small to boot, and if you're ever in the area, I suggest checking it out.

+++ [[[A Merry Fellow]]]

A Day in the life of Tom "Bombadill" Bailey. Explored some of the more esoteric aspects of [[[SCP-1483]]]-- did you know they have fucking //cars// in the Antarctic Empire? And //Radio//? It's a lot more advanced than I originally thought.

+++ [[[Tax Man]]]

A good idea, done poorly.

++ [[[Implanting God]]], [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/gohw-chapter-5-dot-js GoHW > Chapter_5.js], &  [[[The Heresy of Disassembly]]]

All written as part of the 2014 Groups of Interest Contest. I was on the team Rapid Nomenclature Shift alongside [[*user HammerMaiden]] and another individual who I do not care to name. I was in charge of the more cyberpunk aspects of this interpretation of the CotBG, known as the Church of Maxwellism. The stuff I wrote is easily the weakest of the bunch-- there's a reason the CotBG format hasn't been widely used compared to, say, the MC&D format. I still like it, and it's inspired a fair bit of cool art, so there's that.

+++ [[[SCP-2425]]]- Fifth Church Recruitment Tool

My attempt to grok Fifthism through the lens of the Church of Happyology. Could have gone a //lot// better. I still don't get their deal.

++ [[[A Suicide Note]]]

I remember when I announced this on Reddit, [[*user Roget]] said I nearly gave him a heart attack because of the way I did so. This was both a bit of leftover backlash from 239-Abridged thing, as well as part of an attempt to give Clef a bit of semi-sympathetic characterization. Did it do that well? Maybe. Clef himself gave it a 3/5.

++ [http://scp-wiki.net/uiu-series-with-no-name-hub The UIU Series With No Name]]

I will finish this some day. Maybe. Before the heat death of the universe.

This is my second crack at it. I got some incredibly disheartening critique on my first attempt, so I tore it all down and re-wrote it from the ground up. I'm averaging a post a year in it. It's hard to find motivation to write for it, but I do want to.

As far as I'm aware, Quinn MacAllister was one of the first LGBT characters on the site. Probably not //the// first, I'm not going to presume that much. The name of her fiance, Harley, is not a reference to Harley Quinn-- I legitimately just needed a gender-neutral name for her.

+ [[[SCP-2217]]]- Hammer and Anvil

Before I wrote this, I legitimately contemplated leaving the wiki.

My writing had gotten horrible. I couldn't get a solid idea down. I was having more emotional episodes than ever up to that point, college was going poorly, and my entire life was a clusterfuck. I stared at the draft that eventually became this, wondering what I could do.

Then, something clicked. And I went "Holy shit" and banged out the current version in about... two days? I was so happy when I posted it, I rode that high for a week. It's  one of two works I consider as a Magnum Opus of mine on the wiki.

+++ [[[SCP-563]]]- An Abandoned Farm in China

I have nothing but gratitude to [[*user Zyn]], the patron saint of the Wiki, for helping come up with the food ideas in this. I wanted to come back to the theme of eating dinosaurs eventually, and I did, a few years late.r

+++ 2014 Halloween Tale [DELETED]

This was garbage. An attempt to look at Sloth's Pit from the perspective of the townsfolk, following a sudden snowstorm. It was my weakest S&C Plastics thing to date.

++ [http://www.scp-wiki.net/holy-crap-this-is-a-long-christmas-tale The 12 Days of Site-87's Christmas]

I'm pretty sure the Hague has a warrant out for me for the creation of this, due to the pun at the end. I banged this out stream-of-consciousness style, and it shows. I go through it and touch it up some every now and again, and it needs it.

++ [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/excerpts-from-the-medical-tragedy-of-dr-bartholomew-artz-aut Excerpts from the Medical Tragedy of Dr. Bartholemew Artz, Author Unknown]

This is one of the last works I clearly remember writing, before my brain fog got //really// bad. I wrote this as part of the Reimagining Contest, and I'm fairly proud of it, but I'm confident it only got up so high because, again, I wrote it early. Another work (listed a bit later on) was intended to be my original entry, but was denied for reasons I legitimately cant' recall. 049 as an Elizabethan drama is fun.

+++ [[[Satyr's Reign]]]

Just a goofy S&C Plastics tale I wrote in order to distract myself from the whole shebang that was surrounding a certain other canon at the time. Helped cement the eventual romantic relationship between Sinclair and Reynolds.

+++ [[[SCP-2307]]]- The Pen Is Mightier

I want to rewrite this. //So// bad. It's Excalibur with a CotBG Flavor, what's not to like?

EVERYTHING. The writing is jank as hell, the flow is worse than a drunk Soundcloud rapper who thinks that it's okay to rhyme "drink" with "drink", and it's overall just mediocre. I do like my take on Arthur, but the rest...

+++ [[[Oricha's Folly]]]
This was originally intended to be my Reimagining contest entry, a re-imagining of [[[SCP-148]]]. I can't remember why it was denied entry, but The Medical Tragedy is far better, anyway.

+++ [[[The Old Ice]]]

I miss [[*user Fantem]]. Pitch Haven is a great canon, and I'd love to see more from them. This is something I wrote for the canon, and as far as I know, is the latest-dated one in Pitch Haven. I like it.

++ [[[SCP-2147]]]- Neverglades

I'm putting this as important because, for a long time, I legitimately thought this was going to be my last work on the site. My mental issues had snowballed out of control, and I pretty much ragequit the community after several heated discussions and fits of anger. It would be over a year before I published anything else on the wiki. I do like it, but it was a sour note to leave on. 

I still don't feel as if though I paid my pound of flesh for what I said and did back then.

I deleted my first author page then.

[[/collapsible]]

+ 2016- Guess Who's Back?

[[collapsible show="Back Again" hide="Ihp is Back. Tell a friend"]]

After much waffling and flip-flopping, I re-joined the wiki in November of 2016. I first came back into chat in early December, and people have been tolerant of me since. This is where I start actually liking some of my writing.

++ [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/dontcallitacomebackbecauseidontknowifillstay Closure]

My lowest-rated page. I hope it stays that way.

This is kind of a vent piece, related to someone I had mixed feelings on at the time. I shan't say who. But this was my grand return to the wiki. Not much else to say.

+++ [[[SCP-2487]]]- Postman Chasers

My first earnest attempt to get back into writing. Alexylva finally starts punishing mail fraud. I honestly still find this piece to be pretty funny and charming, even a few years after the fact. Even if it is just an over-the-top version of "Dogs Chase Postmen".

+++ [[[Happy Howlidays]]]

Forget the Hague, I'm pretty sure that [[*user ProcyonLotor]] wants me //dead// for this pun. I like this a fair bit better than 12 Days.

+++ [[[An Unconventional Tail]]]

I have no idea why I thought this was okay, but it exists. It did give me an excuse to established that UIUSWNN and S&C Plastics take place in the same canon, though.

[[/collapsible]]

+ 2017: Renaissance

[[collapsible show="Take me home, country roads" hide="To the place I belong"]]

+++ [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/imperfectly-fossilized-eggs-m4rho-edope-fo5le Imprefectly Fossilized Eggs] and [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/a-journal-found-in-the-collection-of-the-peabody-museum-of-n A journal found in the collection of the Peabody Museum of Natural History]

Written for the History Contest. Marshall, Carter and Dark eat dinosaur eggs during the Bone Wars. Not much else to say beyond that-- except for an Easter Egg (ba-dum-tish) hidden in the MC&D Format.

+++ [[[Coyotl]]]

I freaking love [[[SCP-2547]]], and [[*user Petrograd]] suggested in the comments of it that I have it visit Sloth's Pit. So, I did, and it seems to have become a greater part of the Verdant-Veldt Conflict. Which is neat, because that's some good shit.

+++ [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/excerpts-from-training-seminars-for-lesser-known-foundation Excerpts from Training Seminars for Lesser Known Foundation Careers]

This is fucking hilarious. I laughed out loud while writing this, and it's my highest-rated tale for a reason.

++ [[[SCP-3020]]]- Depression

My 3000 entry. The reception to it was... mixed. And so are my feelings for it. I should have picked a less personal topic.

I kind of wish I'd picked a different number for this. I keep on seeing stuff about [[[SCP-2030]]] and think "oh wow someone's covering my thing!" and then, nope. 

+++ [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/sh-tpost-and-c-plastics-tale Fools of Us All]

This tale doesn't exist.

+++ [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-great-site-87-bakesale The Great Site-87 Bakesale]

I'm reluctant to acknowledge the existence of this one as well. But I do like the version of Clef I presented in this.

++ [[[Bazyliszek]]] and [[[Kirche]]]

I'm lumping these two together because they're both set during the 7th Occult War, and deal with the consequences of World War II on the anomalous. Bazylisek is based off of the Basilisk of Warsaw, and my grandmother's experiences during the Warsaw Uprising. Kirche is based off of the Dresden bombing, and the inconsistent death toll.

These were written in the wake of a backlash against a pair of... //very// unfortunate tales, featuring the Foundation collaborating with Nazi forces during World War II. While realistically, it would have happened (if only out of pure pragmatism), but when you have one tale depicting Anne Frank as being a reality bender and the other saying that the Foundation killed mentally disabled people as a service to the world, they should not exist.

I want to make this into a proper tale series one day.

+++ [[[SCP-3773]]]-- 9,000 Lives

One of the reasons 2015 was so hard for me was the disappearance and death of one of our cats. His name was Oliver, and while we suspect we know what happened to him, we didn't have any proof. He was an incredible sweetie pie, and I will always miss him coming up to snuggle next to me in bed. 

Cassandra Pike's cat is based off of my Oliver, broken ribs and all. This is some weird roundabout way to give myself closure to him. I'll always miss you, boo boo.

+ [http://scp-wiki.net/black-autumn-hub Black Autumn]

Fourteen tales. One story arc. Halloween goes horribly wrong in Sloth's Pit, Wisconsin. It's been annualized (hopefully).

I like this, but I wish it was better written. The last two parts really don't jive with the rest, but I think I did a good job keeping the element of mystery as to exactly //what// was causing this intact. People seemed to like it, and I liked writing it.

Kind of wish I still played //The Secret World//, as that's what influenced the hub. But the game is kind of... dead. Still, the Buzzing is a great way of conveying lore, and I'm grateful for its influence.

+++ [[[The Lizard in the Mosaic]]]

The Log of Anomalous Tales was a fun project. Also, from what scientists have been able to tell, a stegosaurus could //easily// have been able to live up to 120 years old. So that's pretty cool.

(I need to do more dinosaur stuff).

+++ [[[SCP-3882]]]- A Literal Metal Band

There's a reason I'm a writer and not a lyricist. Intended to be a more-or-less direct sequel to 2217, there's a lot of stuff in here I like-- namely the fact that the Foundation has its own record label, and the Shattered Deus is not //at all// surprised.
[[/collapsible]]

+ 2018- Rancid Time

[[collapsible show="Time, Time, Time" hide="See What's Become Of Me"]]

This year was way longer than it should have been, for reasons that should be evident to anyone who was part of the wiki at this time. That's all I'll say.

+++ [[[Grim]]]

Another Occult War tale, probably my weakest. I want to go back to this someday.

+++ [[[SCP-3167]]]- Character Assassin (Or: The Serial Killer), [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/dr-keith-partridge-and-the-strawberry-banana-smoothie-of-doo Dr. Keith Partridge and the Strawberry-Banana Smoothie of DOOM] & [[[Hotline Eventide|Hotline: Eventide]]]

The first annual Jamcon gave me some very 'meh' things. I like Eventide the best, even if I haven't gone back to it.

Yet.

++ [[[SCP-3256]]]- Web of Murder

This is one of the few SCPs I've written that I am unconditionally proud of. I fucking //love// this thing, and nobody will take it away from me.

This ties in with an entry for the SCP-3000 contest. Spoilers follow: ##white| It's SCP-3966 (Can't link it due to the red text of the link showing up despite me setting it to white). 3256 is essentially what happens if one of the spiders from 3966 decides to infest your body instead of just sucking you dry in your sleep. But a four-dimensional being trying to impose itself on a three-dimensional one does not work. It hurts not only physically, but ontologically. You are spiders.##

+++ [[[SCP-2947]]]- Fidget Winners

LET'S BEYBLADE! BEYBLAAAAAAAADE.

This was completely fucking dumb. But I love it all the same.

+ [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/i-h-p-proposal I.H. Pickman's Proposal]- Story of Your Life


My 001 proposal. The culmination of over half a decade of writing about a little town in Wisconsin and all the people in it. It's my 100th article... I think. It's intended to be, but SCPPer counts things weird, and Jarvis was being unreliable at the time. As far as I'm concerned, it's my 100th.

For my 200th (if I ever get there before Wikidot blows up) I want to do another 001.

+ [[[SCP-4100]]]-- Future Imperfect

My big 4000 entry. Got me into the top five, closest I'll ever get to a x000 slot. I banged the first draft of this within a couple of hours of the theme being announced, and people on the chat went "What, already?!" Most of my SCPs are written within a couple of days, so I was surprised by the reactions. The theme of History struck a chord with me, what can I say?

4100 is a perfect example of how readership can impact the author's view of their own work. The pictogram at the end was originally intended to be a warning-- "We beat this one, but there are more out there. Secure. Contain. Protect." But some people have taken it to mean "We beat you. We're coming for the rest." I honestly like this interpretation better-- gives the piece a more hopeful tone, and the ending was always meant to be ambiguous. 

++ [[[SCP-2117]]]- //Solidarity//, Stolen 

I wish I didn't have to write this. That's all I'll say.

+ [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/rise-of-the-pit-sloth-hub Black Autumn II: Rise of the Pit Sloth]

This was //so much// fun to write, and I think it's a lot better than Black Autumn I, because I keep it largely focused on two characters (Alison Carol and Robert Tofflemire from [[[SCP-4040]]]) instead of trying to have it as an ensemble. Still probably not as clever as I thought.

+++ [[[SCP-3495]]]- St. Brendan's Howler Monkey

Originally written as part of the Draftswap thing [[*user Rimple]] does on a semi-regular basis. Not as good as it could have been, but I still like it. St.Brendan's story is trippy.

++ [[[SCP-4918]]]- Bergentruckung

I'm just going to copy/paste most of my author commentary from this one so I don't repeat myself. 

> So I had this idea about a week ago, just before the 100th anniversary of the Armistice. It wasn't //originally// going to be a World War I piece, but  [[*user The Great Hippo]] made a few good arguments about why it //should// be WWI and not WWII, among which was the fact that Finland was an allied country, and I think that any Finnish SCP Foundation readers would have their eyebrows raised if [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%A4in%C3%A4m%C3%B6inen Väinämöinen] was allied with the Nazis. Same with Frederick I-- he was really progressive for his day, and would probably have hated Hitler. 

This is also based, in part, on Overly Sarcastic Productions's video on [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVHyXcAJ-Ks Fionn Mac Cumhaill], specifically the segment where Red discusses how the apocalypse is going to be a lot more interesting depending on how many King in the Mountain/Sleeping Hero myths are true.

++ [[[A Christmas Caterwaul]]]

I... don't really like Christmas. For more details, read the author commentary.

[[/collapsible]]

+ 2019-- Not Yet.

I'm not doing author commentaries for 2019 //quite// yet. I have something planned for October that I want you all to see.

+ Unused Ideas

I have a //lot// of unused ideas I'm leaving here for people to claim. Tell me when you do, most of these are canon-neutral.

* "Eat with your eyes"-- an SCP featuring a guy who digests things by looking at them.
* "More like WHY School Musical"-- Tale where a task force gets sucked into a high school musical, and they have to sing their debriefing until the antimemes arrive. I envisioned Gilbert and Sullivan for this, for some reason.

Like my work in any capacity? Want to make sure I can be a starving artist that eats once in a while? Why not buy me a coffee through http://ko-fi.com/ihpkmn? Any amount helps.

++ Living Will

In case I decide to do something utterly stupid and start deleting articles en masse, or go inactive for a period of six or more months, I hereby give the following people retroactive collaboration privileges on my articles.

All S & C Plastics Works and works related to Nexii: [[*user Djoric]], [[*user Weryllium]], [[*user GG Crono]], [[*user Roget]], and [[*user DrChandra]]. All of these individuals are either contributors to or fans of S & C Plastics. Anyone who has contributed to S & C Plastics or any lore involving Sloth's Pit or the concept of Nexuses can also go here.

All works related to the Church of the Broken God: [[*user Zhange]], [[*user SunnyClockwork]], [[*user HammerMaiden]], and any other user that wishes to take up the mantle of Bumario, Trunion or Hedwig. 

All other works are under the purview of [[*user ProcyonLotor]] and any individual they trust enough.

Everything I've done can be found if you dig far enough back in my Sandbox history. Everything that can't can probably be found on the Wayback machine.
