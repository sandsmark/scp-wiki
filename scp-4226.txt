**Item #:** SCP-4226

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4226 must remain in an enclosure which accommodates its physical dimensions while allowing some marginal space: the minimum requirement for containment is a 2m^^3^^ glass box. The material of the enclosure need only be transparent (for observational purposes) and moderately durable against blunt force. A lockable entrance such as a door or hatch is ideal for testing, but is not otherwise necessary. Armed staff stationed outside the enclosure must relieve Researchers of all items which could fracture the Object.

**Description:** SCP-4226 is indiscernible from a bathroom sink typically found in university accommodation, save for its fluid outlet, which consists of a single red valve. It is comprised of a green tiled wall with a small adhesive label that reads “Caution: Very Hot Water”, an enamelled cast-iron basin, an eye-level square mirror, and assorted plumbing which does not appear to lead to any other connected fluid system. From the valve’s outlet, there is a consistent, steady drip of tepid distilled water. 

The time between each drip, as revealed through extensive measurement aided by laser imaging, is thought to be exactly 2 seconds. The path of each droplet seems to operate outside of normal gravitational laws. Despite only travelling around 20cm in a downward direction, the droplet falls slowly and uniformly, taking 2 seconds to reach the surface of the basin before the outlet drips again. This anomaly was responsible for the Foundation’s acquisition of the entity from the University of ██████.

The Foundation has conducted tests using D-Class personnel. Experimentation proceeded as follows:

[[collapsible show="+ DClass_Test_1_OPEN" hide="- DClass_Test_1_CLOSE"]]
> D-████ is instructed to turn the valve attached to SCP-4226. The subject cannot turn it in either direction.

> The subject is then given an exoskeletal cybernetic arm to aid with rotation and grip strength while surveyed by guards equipped with lethal-voltage projectile weaponry.

> The subject fails to turn the valve. A further 28 seconds pass before the subject lashes out at the armed personnel and is summarily terminated. 

> This behaviour is not thought to have been induced by the Object itself. Measures to select more docile D-Class will be taken. Chemical sedation is being considered.

> D-11924 is instructed to interrupt the path of a single droplet. Nothing significant occurs. The subject is mildly dazed. 

> The subject is instructed to interrupt the path of 60 droplets – to cup their hands and retain the water without allowing it to reach the surface of the basin. Immediately after the subject catches the first droplet, they step backward from SCP-4226 with anomalous velocity and vocalise a pain response.

> A significant amount of water falls from D-11924’s hands. When asked why they ceased the experiment after only one drop, the subject appears confused. The subject relates that they could only catch around 54 droplets before the temperature of the water increased to an unmanageable level. The palms of the subject are severely scalded.

> During transferral, D-12009 is non-compliant and tells Researchers that they have already taken part in the experiment. The experiment has not been explained or revealed to the subject at this point. No instructions have been given.

> Researcher Castell asks the subject to clarify. The subject insists that they have completed the experiment “at least 15 times” and “can’t stand the pain”. 

> Researcher Castell asks the subject what the experiment is. The subject relates that they have been repeatedly instructed to interrupt the path of the droplets produced by SCP-4226, a constantly dripping sink, by ingesting 100 of them. This matches the planned experiment. 

> Doctor ████ considers possible classification of D-12009 as an SCP object due to this precognition. Researcher Castell suggests that SCP-4226 is responsible for the anomaly.

> The subject is placed back into detainment.

**Addendum:** SCP-4226’s “Safe” classification has been assigned due to the Foundation’s understanding of its two primary functions:

1.	//Temporal Halt:// Any human individual who interrupts the path of a droplet with their skin will exist in a time-stasis – one which halts all time outside of the confines of the individual’s body and the space that occupies the basin – for as long as they are able to maintain this interruption, in increments of 2 seconds. The steadily increasing temperature of the water far beyond normal evaporative heat and the lack of mobility caused by the necessity of skin contact prevent this particular function from being abused.

2.	//Temporal Regression:// If the interactor with SCP-4226 interrupts via ingestion, Temporal Halt will occur as expected – along with its harmful scalding effects. Once the dripping resumes, however, the interactor will experience the regressive effect. Their mind will be transported, by unclear means, into the body of their past self. The temporal distance of this regression is equal to the time spent in Temporal Halt. 

> Researcher Castell has been seeking Foundation approval for SCP-4226’s re-classification to “Thaumiel” status. He argues that containment breaches could be pre-emptively halted via Staff use of the Object, despite its unwieldiness. His suggestions are undergoing consideration.
